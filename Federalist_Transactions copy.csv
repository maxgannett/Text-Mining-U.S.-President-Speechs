 I the Present of the United States by my own mouth and by a written Speech signed with my own hand [and sealed with the Seal of the U S] Speak to the Seneka Nation and desire their attention and that they would keep this Speech in remembrance of the friendship of the United States.  I have received your Speech with satisfaction as a proof of your confence in the justice of the United States and I have attentively examined the several objects which you have la before me whether delivered by your Chiefs at Tioga point in the last month to Colonel Pickering or la before me in the present month by the Cornplanter and the other Seneca Chiefs now in Philadelphia.  In the first place I observe to you and I request it may sink deep in your minds that it is my desire and the desire of the United States that all the miseries of the late war should be forgotten and buried forever. That in future the United States and the six Nations should be truly brothers promoting each other's prosperity by acts of mutual friendship and justice.  I am not uninformed that the six Nations have been led into some difficulties with respect to the sale of their lands since the peace. But I must inform you that these evils arose before the present government of the United States was established when the separate States and inuals under their authority undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands.  But the case is now entirely altered. The general Government only has the power to treat with the Indian Nations and any treaty formed and held without its authority will not be binding.  Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands. No State nor person can purchase your lands unless at some public treaty held under the authority of the United States. The general government will never consent to your being defrauded. But it will protect you in all your just rights.  Hear well and let it be heard by every person in your Nation That the Present of the United States declares that the general government consers itself bound to protect you in all the lands secured you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix the 22d of October 1784 excepting such parts as you may since had fairly sold to persons properly authorized to purchase of you.  You complain that John Livingston and Oliver Phelps have obtained your lands assisted by Mr. Street of Niagara and they have not complied with their agreement.  It appears upon enquiry of the Governor of New York that John Livingston was not legally authorized to treat with you and that every thing he d with you has been declared null and vo so that you may rest easy on that account.  But it does not appear from any proofs yet in the possession of government that Oliver Phelps has defrauded you.  If however you should have any just cause of complaint against him and can make satisfactory proof thereof the federal Courts will be open to you for redress as to all other persons.  But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining lands and I have therefore upon this point meant to be sufficiently strong and clear.  That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands. That you possess the right to sell and the right of refusing to sell your lands.  That therefore the sale of your lands in future will depend entirely upon yourselves.  But that when you may find it for your interest to sell any parts of your lands the United States must be present by their Agent and will be your security that you shall not be defrauded in the bargain you may make.  [It will however be important that before you make any sales of your land that you should determine among yourselves who are the persons among you that shall give sure conveyances thereof as shall be binding upon your Nation and forever preclude all disputes related to the vality of the sale.]  That beses the [before mentioned] security for your land you will perceive by the law of Congress for regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes the fatherly care the United States intend to take of the Indians. For the particular meaning of this law I refer you to the explanations given thereof by Colonel Pickering at Tioga which with the law are herewith delivered to you.  You have sa in your Speech That the game is going away from among you and that you thought it the design of the great Spirit that you should till the ground but before you speak upon this subject you want to know whether the United States meant to leave you any land to till?  You now know that all the lands secured to you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix excepting such parts as you may since have fairly sold are yours and that only your own acts can convey them away; speak therefore your wishes on the subject of tilling the ground. The United States will be happy to afford you every assistance in the only business which will add to your numbers and happiness.  The murders that have been committed upon some of your people by the bad white men I sincerely lament and reprobate and I earnestly hope that the real murderers will be secured and punished as they deserve. This business has been sufficiently explained to you here by the Governor of Pennsylvania and by Colonel Pickering on behalf of the United States at Tioga.  The Senekas may be assured that the rewards offered for apprehending the murderers will be continued until they are secured for trial and that when they shall be apprehended that they will be tried and punished as if they had killed white men.  Having answered the most material parts of your Speech I shall inform you that some bad Indians and the outcast of several tribes who rese at the Miamee Village have long continued their murders and depredations upon the frontiers lying along the Ohio. That they have not only refused to listen to my voice inviting them to peace but that upon receiving it they renewed their incursions and murders with greater violence than ever. I have therefore been obliged to strike those bad people in order to make them sensible of their madness. I sincerely hope they will hearken to reason and not require to be further chastised. The United States desire to be the friends of the Indians upon terms of justice and humanity. But they will not suffer the depredations of the bad Indians to go unpunished.  My desire is that you would caution all the Senekas and six Nations to. prevent their rash young men from joining the Miamee Indians. For the United States cannot distinguish the tribes to which bad Indians belong and every tribe must take care of their own people.  The merits of the Cornplanter and his friendship for the United States are well known to me and shall not be forgotten. And as a mark of the esteem of the United States I have directed the Secretary of war to make him a present of Two hundred and Fifty Dollars either in money or goods as the Cornplanter shall like best. And he may depend upon the future care and kindness of the United States. And I have also directed the Secretary of War to make suitable presents to the other Chiefs present in Philadelphia. And also that some further tokens of friendship to be forwarded to the other Chiefs now in their Nation.  Remember my words Senekas continue to be strong in your friendship for the United States as the only rational ground of your future happiness and you may rely upon their kindness and protection.  An Agent shall soon be appointed to rese in some place convenient to the Senekas and six Nations. will represent the United States. Apply to him on all occasions.  If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the United States mark that man as your enemy for he will mean to deceive you and lead you into trouble. The United States will be true and faithful to their engagements.
 Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public Affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our Country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce. The progress of public credit is witnessed by a conserable rise of American Stock abroad as well as at home. And the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our Citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.  In conforming to the powers vested in me by acts of the last Session a loan of three millions of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (consering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) gives a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.  Since your last Sessions I have received communications by which it appears that the District of Kentucky at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that State; in consequence of which the District is to become a distinct member of the Union in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be la before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow citizens of Kentucky cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will dece on the case submitted to you.  It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the North West se of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aed by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane overtures92 made on the part of the United States renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable Citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking; whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.  These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the Western Settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the Act which empowers the Present to call out the Militia for the protection of the frontiers. And I have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of Militia as were deemed sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.  The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the Nations most concerned in active Commerce with this Country to abrge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflexion how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own Navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.  Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it distressful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.  The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a Judiciary System have opened the doors of Justice to all descriptions of persons. You will conser in your wisdom whether improvements in that system may yet be made; and particularly whether a uniform process of execution on sentences issuing from the federal Courts be not desireable through all the states.  The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and Seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign Countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that Jurisdiction and those s which are permitted them either by express Convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their resence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the a of the national authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.  The establishment of the Militia; of a mint; of Standards of weights and measures; of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The sufficiency of the Revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the resuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the Interest of the debt funded but as far and as fast as [the] growing resources of the Country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the Western Lands explains your dispositions on this subject: And I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be to every public interest as well as the more satisfactory to our Constituents.  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: In pursuing the various and weighty business of the present Session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your Country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow Citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confence.
Whereas the late wicked and treasonable insurrection against the just authority of the United States of sundry persons in the counties of Northampton Montgomery and Bucks in the State of Pennsylvania in the year 1799 having been speedily suppressed without any of the calamities usually attending rebellion; whereupon peace order and submission to the laws of the United States were restored in the aforesa counties and the ignorant misgued and misinformed in the counties have returned to a proper sense of their duty whereby it is become unnecessary for the public good that any future prosecutions should be commenced or carried on against any person or persons by reason of their being concerned in the sa insurrection:< Wherefore be it known that I John Adams Present of the United States of America have granted and by these presents do grant a full free and absolute pardon to all and every person or persons concerned in the sa insurrection excepting as hereinafter excepted of all treasons misprisions of treason felonies misdemeanors and other crimes by them respectively done or committed against the United States in either of the sa counties before the 12th day of March in the year 1799 excepting and excluding therefrom every person who now standeth indicted or convicted of any treason misprision of treason or other offense against the United States whereby remedying and releasing unto all persons except as before excepted all pains and penalties incurred or supposed to be incurred for or on account of the premises.< Given under my hand and the seal of the United States of America at the city of Philadelphia this 21st day of May A. D. 1800 and of the Independence of the sa States the twentyfourth.< JOHN ADAMS.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again calledinto office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizensat large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimonyof public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude forall those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoredby my country on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for thatretirement from which no private conseration should ever have torn me.But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated accordingto its real motives and that the people and the authorities derived fromthem would support exertions having nothing personal for their objectI have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive power;and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations dependsto crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness. As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom theUnited States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehendthat our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our dispositionfor peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained bybelligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish ourcitizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile actsto any of the parties and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legalstate of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belongingto our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will bela before you was issued. In this posture of affairs both new and delicate I resolved to adoptgeneral rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privilegesof the United States. These were reduced into a system which will be communicatedto you. Although I have not thought of myself at liberty to forb thesale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to bebrought into our ports I have not refused to cause them to be restoredwhen they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vesselscommissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the UnitedStates. It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct improve or enforcethis plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extendthe legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Statesto many cases which though dependent on principles already recognizeddemand some further provisions. Where inuals shall within the United States array themselvesin hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditionsor enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States or usurp andexercise judicial authority within the United States or where the penaltieson violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly markedor are inadequate  these offenses can not receive too early and closean attention and require prompt and decisive remedies. Whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered bythe judiciary who possess a longestablished course of investigationeffectual process and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particularcircumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peaceand even of a citizen of the United States although seized under a falsecolor of being hostile property and have denied their power to liberatecertain captures within the protection of our territory it would seemproper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the Executiveis to be the resort in either of the two lastmentioned cases it is hopedthat he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courtswhen for his own information he shall request it. I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of ourduties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessityof placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exactingfrom them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United Statesought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of humanevents they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to armswith which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank dueto the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutelylost by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avo insult we mustbe able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace one of the most powerfulinstruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at alltimes ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you willshew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazinesand arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies can not with prudencebe neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuringwarlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censureor jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government. They are incapableof abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pre in beingthe depository of the force of the Republic and may be trained to a degreeof energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But itis an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued whether the act moreeffectually to prove for the national defense by establishing an uniformmilitia throughout the United States has organized them so as to producetheir full effect; whether your own experience in the several States hasnot detected some imperfections in the scheme and whether a material featurein an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for thestudy of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever beattained by practice alone. The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremelyinteresting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under theknowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequentcommunication. When we con the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmedthat every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissensionwith the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the commissionersevince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peaceand a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests anddignity of the United States. The attempt however of an amicable negotiationhaving been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively. Althoughthe proposed treaty d not arrest the progress of military preparationit is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justifiedactive movements may retard them during the remainder of the year. Fromthe papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject youwill determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted bylaw shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragementsshall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace withthe Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn andwith clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during therecess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutionshave been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the paperswhich will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which westand in regard to both those tribes and it is with Congress to pronouncewhat shall be done. After they shall have proved for the present emergency it will merittheir most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanentby creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice onthe violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the Indian nationsin behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment.But it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion with constantand plentiful supplies with a ready market for the commodities of theIndians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive inexchange. Inuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be alluredby the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to bereimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion ofCongress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any meansyet in the hands of the Executive. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between theUnited States and inual States concluded their important within the time limited by law and the balances struck in their reportwhich will be la before Congress have been placed on the books of theTreasury. On the first day of June last an installment of 1000000 florins becamepayable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjustedby a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loanat an interest of 5% for the term of ten years and the expenses of thisoperation were a commission of 3%. The first installment of the loan of $2000000 from the Bank of theUnited States has been pa as was directed by law. For the second itis necessary that provision be made. No pecuniary conseration is more urgent than the regular redemptionand discharge of the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious oran economy of time more valuable. The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued toequal the anticipations which were formed of it but it is not expectedto prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Someauxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite andit is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to theconvenience of our citizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdomof encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviatea future accumulation of burthens. But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportationof public prints. There is no resource so firm for the Government of theUnited States as the affections of the people gued by an enlighteneolicy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithfulrepresentation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughoutthe United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current serviceof the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and militarystores made during the recess will be presented to Congress. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The several subjects to which I have now referred open a we rangeto your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of ourcommon country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude ofyour task. Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the Governmentmay be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentimentits dignity may be lost. But as the legislative proceedings of the UnitedStates will never I trust be reproached for the want of temper or ofcandor so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of mystrenuous and warmest cooperation. 
 Whereas it appears that a state of war exists between Austria Prussia Sardinia Great Britain and the United Netherlands on the one part and France on the other; and the duty and interest of the United States require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers:  I have therefore thought fit by these presents to declare the disposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesa towards those powers respectively; and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avo all acts and proceedings whatsoever which may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition.  And I do hereby also make known that whosoever of the citizens of the United States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations by committing aing or abetting hostilities against any of the sa powers or by carrying to any of them those articles which are deemed contraband by the modern usage of nations will not receive the protection of the United States against such punishment or forfeiture; and further that I have given instructions to those officers to whom it belongs to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons who shall within the cognizance of the Courts of the United States violate the law of nations with respect to the powers at war or any of them.
 Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have maturely consered the Act passed by the two Houses intitled An Act for an apportionment of Representatives among the several States according to the first enumeration 44 and I return it to your House wherein it originated with the following objections.  First: The Constitution has prescribed that Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective Numbers: and there is no one proportion or ision which applied to the respective numbers of the States will yield the number and allotment of Representatives proposed by the bill.  Second. The Constitution has also proved that the number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand: which restriction is by the context and by fair and obvious construction to be applied to the seperate and respective numbers of the States: and the bill has allotted to eight of the States more than one for thirty thousand. 
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and the House of Representatives: Among the vicissitudes incent to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the fourteenth day of the present month. On the one hand I was summoned by my Country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my Country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualification could not but overwhelm with dispondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficencies. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if in executing this task I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confence of my fellowcitizens; and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me and its consequences be judged by my Country with some share of the partiality in which they originated. Such being the impressions under which I have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station; it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official Act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe who preses in the Councils of Nations and whose provential as can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the People of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes: and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the s allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my fellowcitizens at large less than either. No People can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the Affairs of men more than the People of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of provential agency. And in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their United Government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted cannot be compared with the means by which most Governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me I trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free Government can more auspiciously commence. By the article establishing the Executive Department it is made the duty of the Present to recommend to your conseration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject farther than to refer to the Great Constitutional Charter under which you are assembled; and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on one se no local prejudices or attachments; no seperate s nor party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests: so on another that the foundations of our National policy will be la in the pure and immutable principles of private morality; and the preeminence of a free Government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its Citizens and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my Country can inspire: since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the oeconomy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the sol rewards of public prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained: And since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the Republican model of Government are justly consered as deeply perhaps as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people. Beses the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to dece how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the Fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the System or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which I could be gued by no lights derived from official opportunities I shall again give way to my entire confence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good: For I assure myself that whilst you carefully avo every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an United and effective Government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted. To the preceeding observations I have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honoured with a call into the Service of my Country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which I cond my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed. And being still under the impressions which produced it I must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the Executive Department; and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the Station in which I am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require. Having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility and dispositions for decing with unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government for the security of their Union and the advancement of their happiness; so his ine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged s the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend. 
It is with peculiar satisfaction that I meet the 6th Congress of the United States of America. Coming from all parts of the Union at this critical and interesting period the members must be fully possessed of the sentiments and wishes of our constituents.The flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land and by sea; the prosperity of our extended commerce notwithstanding interruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the world; the return of health industry and trade to those cities which have lately been afflicted with disease and the various and inestimable advantages civil and religious which secured under our happy frame of government are continued to us unimpaired demand of the whole American people sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity for the merciful dispensations of His provence.But while these numerous blessings are recollected it is a painful duty to advert to the ungrateful return which has been made for them by some of the people in certain counties of Pennsylvania where seduced by the arts and misrepresentations of designing men they have openly resisted the law directing the valuation of houses and lands. Such defiance was given to the civil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts by judicial process to enforce the execution of the law and it became necessary to direct a military force to be employed consisting of some companies of regular troops volunteers and militia by whose zeal and activity in cooperation with the judicial power order and submission were restored and many of the offenders arrested. Of these some have been convicted of misdemeanors and others charged with various crimes remain to be tried.To give due effect to the civil administration of government and to insure a just execution of the laws a revision and amendment of the judiciary system is indispensably necessary. In this extensive country it can not but happen that numerous questions respecting the interpretation of the laws and the rights and duties of officers and citizens must arise. On the one hand the laws should be executed; on the other inuals should be guarded from oppression. Neither of these objects is sufficiently assured under the present organization of the judicial department. I therefore earnestly recommend the subject to your serious conseration.Persevering in the pacific and humane policy which had been invariably professed and sincerely pursued by the executive authority of the United States when indications were made on the part of the French Republic of a disposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two countries I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances by a nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of our country dictated and which its moderation had given it a right to prescribe.The assurances which were required of the French government previous to the departure of our envoys have been given through their minister of foreign relations and I have directed them to proceed on their mission to Paris. They have full power to conclude a treaty subject to the constitutional advice and consent of the Senate. The characters of these gentlemen are sure pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with its honor or interest nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or friendship to any other nation will be stipulated.It appearing probable from the information I received that our commercial intercourse with some ports in the island of St. Domingo might safely be renewed I took such steps as seemed to me expedient to ascertain that point. The result being satisfactory I then in conformity with the act of Congress on the subject directed the restraints and prohibitions of that intercourse to be discontinued on terms which were made known by proclamation. Since the renewal of this intercourse our citizens trading to those ports with their property have been duly respected and privateering from those ports has ceased.In examining the claims of British subjects by the commissioners at Philadelphia acting under the sixth article of the treaty of amity commerce and igation with Great Britain a difference of opinion on points deemed essential in the interpretation of that article has arisen between the commissioners appointed by the United States and the other members of that board from which the former have thought it their duty to withdraw. It is sincerely to be regretted that the execution of an article produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice should have been thus uoably interrupted. It is however confently expected that the same spirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated will lead to satisfactory explanations.In consequence of the obstacles to the progress of the commission in Philadelphia His Britannic Majesty has directed the commissioners appointed by him under the seventh article of the treaty relating to the British captures of American vessels to withdraw from the board sitting in London but with the express declaration of his determination to fulfill with punctuality and good faith the engagements which His Majesty has contracted by his treaty with the United States and that they will be instructed to resume their s whenever the obstacles which impede the progress of the commission at Philadelphia shall be removed. It being in like manner my sincere determination so far as the same depends on me that with equal punctuality and good faith the engagements contracted by the United States in their treaties with His Britannic Majesty shall be fulfilled I shall immediately instruct our minister at London to endeavor to obtain the explanation necessary to a just performance of those engagements on the part of the United States. With such dispositions on both ses I can not entertain a doubt that all difficulties will soon be removed and that the two boards will then proceed and bring the business committed to them respectively to a satisfactory conclusion.The act of Congress relative to the seat of the government of the United States requiring that on the first Monday of December next it should be transferred from Philadelphia to the District chosen for its permanent seat it is proper for me to inform you that the commissioners appointed to prove suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the Present and of the public offices of the government have made a report of the state of the buildings designed for those purposes in the city of Washington from which they conclude that the removal of the seat of government to that place at the time required will be practicable and the accommodation satisfactory. Their report will be la before you.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:I shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the service of the ensuing year together with an account of the revenue and expenditure to be la before you. During a period in which a great portion of the civilized world has been involved in a war unusually calamitous and destructive it was not to be expected that the United States could be exempted from extraordinary burthens. Although the period is not arrived when the measures adopted to secure our country against foreign attacks can be renounced yet it is alike necessary for the honor of the government and the satisfaction of the community that an exact economy should be maintained. I invite you gentlemen to investigate the different branches of the public expenditure. The examination will lead to beneficial retrenchments or produce a conviction of the wisdom of the measures to which the expenditure relates.Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:At a period like the present when momentous changes are occurring and every hour is preparing new and great events in the political world when a spirit of war is prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the interests of the United States have any connection unsafe and precarious would be our situation were we to neglect the means of maintaining our just rights. The result of the mission to France is uncertain; but however it may terminate a steady perseverance in a system of national defense commensurate with our resources and the situation of our country is an obvious dictate of wisdom; for remotely as we are placed from the belligerent nations and desirous as we are by doing justice to all to avo offense to any nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions will secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities of war or national degradation. As to myself it is my anxious desire so to execute the trust reposed in me as to render the people of the United States prosperous and happy. I rely with entire confence on your cooperation in objects equally your care and that our mutual labors will serve to increase and confirm union among our fellow citizens and an unshaken attachment to our government. 
The personal inconveniences to the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives in leaving their families and private affairs at this season of the year are so obvious that I the more regret the extraordinary occasion which has rendered the convention of Congress indispensable. It would have afforded me the highest satisfaction to have been able to congratulate you on a restoration of peace to the nations of Europe whose animosities have endangered our tranquillity; but we have still abundant cause of gratitude to the Supreme Dispenser of National Blessings for general health and promising seasons for domestic and social happiness for the rap progress and ample acquisitions of industry through extensive territories for civil political and religious liberty. While other states are desolated with foreign war or convulsed with intestine isions the United States present the pleasing prospect of a nation governed by mild and equal laws generally satisfied with the possession of the rights neither envying the advantages nor fearing the power of other nations solicitous only for the maintenance of order and justice and the preservation of liberty increasing daily in their attachment to a system of government in proportion to their experience of its utility yielding a ready and general obedience to laws flowing from the reason and resting on the only sol foundation  the affections of the people. It is with extreme regret that I shall be obliged to turn your thoughts to other circumstances which admonish us that some of these felicities may not be lasting. But if the te of our prosperity is full and a reflux commencing a vigilant circumspection becomes us that we may meet our reverses with fortitude and extricate ourselves from their consequences with all the skill we possess and all the efforts in our power. In giving to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommending to their conseration such measures as appear to me to be necessary or expedient according to my constitutional duty the causes and the objects of the present extraordinary session will be explained. After the present of the United States received information that the French government had expressed serious discontents at some proceedings of the government of these states sa to affect the interests of France he thought it expedient to send to that country a new minister fully instructed to enter on such amicable discussions and to give such cand explanations as might happily remove the discontents and suspicions of the French government and vindicate the conduct of the United States. For this purpose he selected from among his fellow citizens a character whose integrity talents experience and services had placed him in the rank of the most esteemed and respected in the nation. The direct object of his mission was expressed in his letter of credence to the French republic being to maintain that good understanding which from the commencement of the alliance had subsisted between the two nations and to efface unfavorable impressions banish suspicions and restore that cordiality which was at once the evence and pledge of a friendly union. And his instructions were to the same effect faithfully to represent the disposition of the government and people of the United States (their disposition being 1); to remove jealousies and obviate complaints by shewing that they were groundless to restore that mutual confence which had been so unfortunately and injuriously impaired and to explain the relative interests of both countries and the real sentiments of his own. A minister thus specially commissioned it was expected would have proved the instrument of restoring mutual confence between the two republics. The first step of the French government corresponded with that expectation. A few days before his arrival at Paris the French minister of foreign relations informed the American minister then resent at Paris of the formalities to be observed by himself in taking leave and by his successor preparatory to his reception. These formalities they observed and on the 9th of December presented officially to the minister of foreign relations the one a copy of his letters of recall the other a copy of his letters of credence. These were la before the Executive Directory. Two days afterwards the minister of foreign relations informed the recalled American minister that the Executive Directory had determined not to receive another minister plenipotentiary from the United States until after the redress of grievances demanded of the American government and which the French republic had a right to expect from it. The American minister immediately endeavored to ascertain whether by refusing to receive him it was intended that he should retire from the territories of the French republic and verbal answers were given that such was the intention of the Directory. For his own justification he desired a written answer but obtained none until toward the last of January when receiving notice in writing to quit the territories of the republic he proceeded to Amsterdam where he proposed to wait for instruction from this government. During his resence at Paris cards of hospitality were refused him and he was threatened with being subjected to the jurisdiction of the minister of police; but with becoming firmness he insisted on the protection of the law of nations due to him as the known minister of a foreign power. You will derive further information from his dispatches which will be la before you. As it is often necessary that nations should treat for the mutual advantage of their affairs and especially to accommodate and terminate differences and as they can treat only by ministers the right of embassy is well known and established by the law and usage of nations. The refusal on the part of France to receive our minister is then the denial of a right; but the receive him until we have acceded to their demands without discussion and without investigation is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends nor as a sovereign state. With this conduct of the French government it will be proper to take into  the public audience given to the late minister of the United States on his taking leave of the Executive Directory. The speech of the present discloses sentiments more alarming than the refusal of a minister because more dangerous to our independence and union and at the same time studiously marked with indignities toward the government of the United States. It evinces a disposition to separate the people of the United States from the government to persuade them that they have different affections principles and interests from those of their fellow citizens whom they themselves have chosen to manage their common concerns and thus to produce isions fatal to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a decision which shall convince France and the world that we are not a degraded people humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority fitted to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence and regardless of national honor character and interest. I should have been happy to have thrown a veil over these transactions if it had been possible to conceal them; but they have passed on the great theater of the world in the face of all Europe and America and with such circumstances of publicity and solemnity that they can not be disguised and will not soon be forgotten. They have inflicted a wound in the American breast. It is my sincere desire however that it may be healed. It is my sincere desire and in this I presume I concur with you and with our constituents to preserve peace and friendship with all nations; and believing that neither the honor nor the interest of the United States absolutely forb the repetition of advances for securing these desirable objects with France I shall institute a fresh attempt at negotiation and shall not fail to promote and accelerate an accommodation on terms compatible with the rights duties interests and honor of the nation. If we have committed errors and these can be demonstrated we shall be willing on conviction to redress them; and equal measures of justice we have a right to expect from France and every other nation. The diplomatic intercourse between the United States and France being at present suspended the government has no means of obtaining official information from that country. Nevertheless there is reason to believe that the Executive Directory passed a decree on the 2nd of March last contravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778 injurious to our lawful commerce and endangering the lives of our citizens. A copy of this decree will be la before you. While we are endeavoring to adjust all our differences with France by amicable negotiation the progress of the war in Europe the depredations on our commerce the personal injuries to our citizens and the general complexion of affairs render it my indispensable duty to recommend to your conseration effectual measures of defense. The commerce of the United States has become an interesting object of attention whether we conser it in relation to the wealth and finances or the strength and resources of the nation. With a sea coast of near 2000 miles in extent opening a we field for fisheries igation and commerce a great portion of our citizens naturally apply their industry and enterprise to these objects. Any serious and permanent injury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorders. To prevent it from being undermined and destroyed it is essential that it receive an adequate protection. The al establishment must occur to every man who consers the injuries committed on our commerce the insults offered to our citizens and the description of vessels by which these abuses have been practiced. As the sufferings of our mercantile and sea faring citizens can not be ascribed to the omission of duties demandable consering the neutral situation of our country they are to be attributed to the hope of impunity arising from a supposed inability on our part to afford protection. To resist the consequences of such impressions on the minds of foreign nations and to guard against the degradation and servility which they must finally stamp on the American character is an important duty of government. A al power next to the militia is the natural defense of the United States. The experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that a moderate al force such as would be easily within the present abilities of the Union would have been sufficient to have baffled many formable transportations of troops from one state to another which were then practiced. Our sea coasts from their great extent are more easily annoyed and more easily defended by a al force than any other. With all the materials our country abounds; in skill our al architects and igators are equal to any and commanders and sea men will not be wanting. But although the establishment of a permanent system of al defense appears to be requisite I am sensible it can not be formed so speedily and extensively as the present crisis demands. Hitherto I have thought proper to prevent the sailing of armed vessels except on voyages to the East Indies where general usage and the danger from pirates appeared to render the permission proper. Yet the restriction has originated solely from a wish to prevent collisions with the powers at war contravening the act of Congress of June 1794 and not from any doubt entertained by me of the policy and propriety of permitting our vessels to employ means of defense while engaged in a lawful foreign commerce. It remains for Congress to prescribe such regulations as will enable our sea faring citizens to defend themselves against violations of the law of nations and at the same time restrain them from committing acts of hostility against the powers at war. In addition to this voluntary provision for defense by inual citizens it appears to me necessary to equip the frigates and prove other vessels of inferior force to take under convoy such merchant vessels as shall remain unarmed. The greater part of the cruisers whose depredations have been most injurious have been built and some of them partially equipped in the United States. Although an effectual remedy may be attended with difficulty yet I have thought it my duty to present the subject generally to your conseration. If a mode can be devised by the wisdom of Congress to prevent the resources of the United States from being converted into the means of annoying our trade a great evil will be prevented. With the same  I think it proper to mention that some of our citizens resent abroad have fitted out privateers and others have voluntarily taken the command or entered on board of them and committed spoliations on the commerce of the United States. Such unnatural and iniquitous practices can be restrained only by severe punishments. But beses a protection of our commerce on the seas I think it highly necessary to protect it at home where it is collected in our most important ports. The distance of the United States from Europe and the well known promptitude ardor and courage of the people in defense of their country happily diminish the probability of invasion. Nevertheless to guard against sudden and predatory incursions the situation of some of our principal sea ports demands your conseration. And as our country is vulnerable in other interests beses those of its commerce you will seriously deliberate whether the means of general defense ought not to be increased by an addition to the regular artillery and cavalry and by arrangements for forming a provisional army. With the same  and as a measure which even in a time of universal peace ought not to be neglected I recommend to your conseration a revision of the laws for organizing arming and disciplining the militia to render that natural and safe defense of the country efficacious. Although it is very true that we ought not to involve ourselves in the political system of Europe but to keep ourselves always distinct and separate from it if we can yet to effect this separation early punctual and continual information of the current chain of events and of the political projects in contemplation is no less necessary than if we were directly concerned in them. It is necessary in order to the discovery of the efforts made to draw us into the vortex in season to make preparations against them. However we may conser ourselves the maritime and commercial powers of the world will conser the United States of America as forming a weight in that balance of power in Europe which never can be forgotten or neglected. It would not only be against our interest but it would be doing wrong to half of Europe at least if we should voluntarily throw ourselves into either scale. It is a natural policy for a nation that studies to be neutral to consult with other nations engaged in the same studies and pursuits. At the same time that measures might be pursued with this  our treaties with Prussia and Sweden one of which is expired and the other near expiring might be renewed. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:It is particularly your province to conser the state of the public finances and to adopt such measures respecting them as exigencies shall be found to require. The preservation of public credit the regular extinguishment of the public debt and a provision of funds to defray any extraordinary expenses will of course call for your serious attention. Although the imposition of new burthens can not be in itself agreeable yet there is no ground to doubt that the American people will expect from you such measures as their actual engagements their present security and future interests demand. Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:The present situation of our country imposes an obligation on all the departments of government to adopt an explicit and deced conduct. In my situation an exposition of the principles by which my administration will be governed ought not be omitted. It is impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world what has been before observed that endeavors have been employed to foster and establish a ision between the government and people of the United States. To investigate the causes which have encouraged this attempt is not necessary; but to repel by deced and united councils insinuations so derogatory to the honor and aggressions so dangerous to the Constitution union and even independence of the nation is an indispensable duty. It must not be permitted to be doubted whether the people of the United States will support the government established by their voluntary consent and appointed by their free choice or whether by surrendering themselves to the direction of foreign and domestic factions in opposition to their own government they will forfeit the honorable station they have hitherto maintained. For myself having never been indifferent to what concerned the interests of my country devoted the best part of my life to obtain and support its independence and constantly witnessed the patriotism felity and perseverance of my fellow citizens on the most trying occasions it is not for me to hesitate or abandon a cause in which my heart has been so long engaged. Convinced that the conduct of the government has been just and impartial to foreign nations that those internal regulations which have been established by law for the preservation of peace are in their nature proper and that they have been fairly executed nothing will ever be done by me to impair the national engagements to innovate upon principles which have been so deliberately and uprightly established or to surrender in any manner the rights of the government. To enable me to maintain this declaration I rely under God with entire confence on the firm and enlightened support of the national legislature and upon the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizens. 
Beloved Cherokees< Many years have passed since the White people first came to America. In that long space of time many good men have consered how the condition of the Indian natives of the country might be improved; and many attempts have been made to effect it. But as we see at this day all these attempts have been nearly fruitless. I also have thought much on this subject and anxiously wished that the various Indian tribes as well as their neighbours the White people might enjoy in abundance all the good things which make life comfortable and happy. I have consered how this could be done; and have discovered but one path that could lead them to that desirable situation. In this path I wish all the Indian nations to walk. From the information received concerning you my beloved Cherokees I am inclined to hope that you are prepared to take this path and disposed to pursue it. It may seem a little difficult to enter; but if you make the attempt you will find every obstacle easy to be removed. Mr. Dinsmoor my beloved agent to your nation being here I send you this talk by him. will have it interpreted to you and particularly explain my meaning.< Beloved Cherokees< You now find that the game with which your woods once abounded are growing scarce; and you know when you cannot meet a deer or other game to kill that you must remain hungry; you know also when you can get no skins by hunting that the traders will give you neither powder nor cloathing; and you know that without other implements for tilling the ground than the hoe you will continue to raise only scanty crops of corn. Hence you are sometimes exposed to suffer much from hunger and cold; and as the game are lessening in numbers more and more these sufferings will increase. And how are you to prove against them? Listen to my words and you will know.< My beloved Cherokees< Some among you already experience the advantage of keeping cattle and hogs: let all keep them and increase their numbers and you will ever have a plenty< of meet. To these add sheep and they will give you cloathing as well as food. Your lands are good and of great extent. By proper management you can raise live stock not only for your own wants but to sell to the White people. By using the plow you can vastly increase your crops of corn. You can also grow wheat (which makes the best bread) as well as other useful grain. To these you will easily add flax and cotton which you may dispose of to the White people or have it made up by your own women into cloathing for yourselves. Your wives and daughters can soon learn to spin and weave; and to make this certain I have directed Mr. Dinsmoor to procure all the necessary apparatus for spinning and weaving and to hire a woman to teach the use of them. will also procure some plows and other implements of husbandry with which to begin the improved cultivation of the ground which I recommend and employ a fit person to shew you how they are to be used. I have further directed him to procure some cattle and sheep for the most prudent and industrious men who shall be willing to exert themselves in tilling the ground and raising those useful animals. is often to talk with you on these subjects and give you all necessary information to promote your success. I must therefore desire you to listen to him; and to follow his advice. I appointed him to dwell among you as the Agent of the United States because I judged him to be a faithful man ready to obey my instructions and to do you good.< But the cares of the United States are not confined to your single nation.< They extend to all the Indians dwelling on their borders. For which reason other agents are appointed; and for the four southern nations there will be a general or principal agent who will visit all of them for the purpose of maintaining peace and friendship among them and with the United States; to superintend all their affairs; and to assist the particular agents with each nation in doing the business assigned them. To such general or principal agent I must desire your careful attention. will be one of our greatly beloved men. His whole time will be employed in contriving how to do you good and you will therefore act wisely to follow his advice. The first general or principal agent will be Colonel Benjamin Hawkins a man already known and respected by you. I have chosen him for this office because he is esteemed for a good man; has a knowledge of Indian customs and a particular love and friendship for all the Southern tribes.< Beloved Cherokees< What I have recommended to you I am myself going to do. After a few moons are passed I shall leave the great town and retire to my farm. There I shall attend to the means of increasing my cattle sheep and other useful animals; to the growing of corn wheat and other grain and to the employing of women in spinning and weaving; all which I have recommended to you that you may be as comfortable and happy as plenty of food clothing and other good things can make you.< Beloved Cherokees< When I have retired to my farm I shall hear of you; and it will give me great pleasure to know that you have taken my advice and are walking in the path which I have described. But before I retire I shall speak to my beloved man the Secretary of War to get prepared some medals to be given to such Cherokees as by following my advice shall best deserve them. For this purpose Mr. Dinsmoor is from time to time to visit every town in your nation. will give instructions to those who desire to learn what I have recommended. will see what improvements are made; who are most industrious in raising cattle; in growing corn wheat cotton and flax; and in spinning and weaving; and on those who excel these rewards are to be bestowed.< Beloved Cherokees< The advice I here give you is important as it regards your nation; but still< more important as the event of the experiment made with you may determine the< lot of many nations. If it succeeds the beloved men of the United States will be encouraged to give the same assistance to all the Indian tribes within their boundaries. But if it should fail they may think it vain to make any further attempts to better the condition of any Indian tribe; for the richness of the soil and mildness of the air render your country highly favorable for the practice of what I have recommended.< Beloved Cherokees< The wise men of the United States meet together once a year to conser what< will be for the good of all their people. The wise men of each separate state also meet together once or twice every year to consult and do what is good for the people of their respective states. I have thought that a meeting of your wise men once or twice a year would be alike useful to you. Every town might send one or two of its wisest counsellors to talk together on the affairs of your nation and to recommend to your people whatever they should think would be serviceable. The beloved agent of the United States would meet with them. would give them information of those things which are found good by the white people and which your situation will enable you to adopt. would explain to them the laws made by the great council of the United States for the preservation of peace; for the protection of your lands; for the security of your persons; for your improvement in the arts of living and for promoting your general welfare. If it should be agreeable to you that your wise men should hold such meetings you will speak your mind to my beloved man Mr. Dinsmoor to be communicated to the Present of the United States who will give such directions as shall be proper.< Beloved Cherokees< That this talk may be known to all your nation and not forgotten I have caused it to be printed and directed one signed by my own hand to be lodged in each of your towns. The Interpreters will on proper occasions read and interpret the same to all your people.< Beloved Cherokees< Having been informed that some of your chiefs wished to see me in Philadelphia I have sent them word that I would receive a few of the most esteemed. I now repeat that I shall be glad to see a small number of your wisest chiefs; but I shall not expect them 'till November. I shall take occasion to agree with them on the running of the boundary line between your lands and ours agreeably to the treaty of Holston. I shall expect them to inform me what chiefs are to attend the running of this line and I shall tell them whom I appoint to run it; and the time and place of beginning may then be fixed.< I now send my best wishes to the Cherokees and pray the Great spirit to preserve them.
I trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have never met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy.< The termination of the long expensive and distressing war in which we have been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region.< In the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity. the object it is believed has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon will immediately be la before the Senate for their conseration.< The Creek and Cherokee Indians who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontiers have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties with us and were giving evence of a sincere disposition to carry them into effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken. But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger which will be productive of further expense and may occasion more effusion of blood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert general hostility.< A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father the late Emperor and consequently the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Day and Regency of that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the resolution of our unfortunate fellow citizens from a grievous captivity.< The latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madr give moreover the pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event depending upon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which securing amicably very essential interests of the United States will at the same time lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate.< Though not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives you gentlemen are all apprised that a treaty of amity commerce and igation has been negotiated with Great Britain and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation I have added my sanction. The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown. When received the subject will without delay be placed before Congress.< This interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding opens a we field for consoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every se the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity on terms compatible with our national rights and honor shall be the happy result how firm and how precious a foundation will have been la for accelerating maturing and establishing the prosperity of our country.< Contemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of the United States we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe with their American dependencies have been involved in a contest unusually bloody exhausting and calamitous in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay; in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings; while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens which press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of government our favored country happy in a striking contrast has enjoyed tranquillity—a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty. Faithful to ourselves we have violated no obligation to others.< Our agriculture commerce and manufactures prosper beyond former example the molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which however very pointed remonstrances have been made) being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our population advances with a celerity which exceeding the most sanguine calculations proportionally augments our strength and resources and guarantees our future security.< Every part of the Union displays indications of rap and various improvement; and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty and with mild and wholesome laws is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed if ever before equaled?< Placed in a situation every way so auspicious motives of commanding force impel us with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our country to unite our efforts to preserve prolong and improve our immense advantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart.< It is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order. The misled have abandoned their errors and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the society. These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice dignity and safety may permit.< Gentlemen: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session a re of our military establishment is not the least important. It is called for by the events which have changed and may be expected still further to change the relative situation of our frontiers. In this re you will doubtless allow due weight to the conserations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted that the war in Europe is not yet terminated and that our Western posts when recovered will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present military force will be la before you by the Department of War.< With the re of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the conseration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils.< While we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations namely that the provisions heretofore made with a  to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent women and children who are chiefly the victims of retaliation must continue to shock humanity and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union.< To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms (a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude) I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this work if practicable will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know.< Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:< The state of our revenue with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress will be submitted from the proper Department together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year.< Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination. Congress have demonstrated their sense to be and it were superfluous to repeat mine that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents.< Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:< The statements which will be la before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters.< The progress in proving materials for the frigates and in building them the state of the fortifications of our harbors the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing our magazines with military stores and the steps which have been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress.< Temperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace happiness and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine.

WASHINGTON.By the Present:EDM: RANDOLPF
I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary on account of the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia to convene the National Legislature at some other place. This measure it was desirable to avo because it would occasion much public inconvenience and a conserable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants of this city whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their fellow citizens. Therefore after taking measures to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness I postponed my determination having hopes now happily realized that without hazard to the lives or health of the members Congress might assemble at this place where it was next by law to meet. I submit however to your conseration whether a power to postpone the meeting of Congress without passing the time fixed by the Constitution upon such occasions would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794. Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in Europe and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our citizens from injustice and violence at sea we have nevertheless abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for interior tranquillity and personal security for propitious seasons prosperous agriculture productive fisheries and general improvements and above all for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support our sovereignty as well as our moral and our religious principles against all open and secret attacks. Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked  one in July the other in August  to join their colleague in Holland. I have received intelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland from whence they all proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of September. Whatever may be the result of this mission I trust that nothing will have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to a successful conclusion on such equitable terms as may be compatible with the safety honor and interest of the United States. nothing in the mean time will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasions the people of the United States have given such memorable proofs and the exertion of those resources for national defense which a beneficent Provence has kindly placed within their power. It may be confently asserted that nothing has occurred since the adjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary measures recommended by me to the conseration of the two Houses at the opening of your late extraordinary session. If that system was then prudent it is more so now as increasing depredations strengthen the reasons for its adoption. Indeed whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France and whether the war in Europe is or is not to continue I hold it most certain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained. The state of society has so long been disturbed the sense of moral and religious obligations so much weakened public faith and national honor have been so impaired respect to treaties has been so diminished and the law of nations has lost so much of its force while pre ambition avarice and violence have been so long unrestrained there remains no reasonable ground on which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or defense will not be plundered. The commerce of the United States is essential if not to their existence at least to their comfort their growth prosperity and happiness. The genius character and habits of the people are highly commercial. Their cities have been formed and exist upon commerce. Our agriculture fisheries arts and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it. In short commerce has made this country what it is and it can not be destroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and distress. Great numbers are directly and solely supported by igation. The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of commercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens. Under this  of our affairs I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if I forbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our commerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the only sure means of preserving both. I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at the opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable information of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty respecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the demarcation of the line of limits but by the latest authentic intelligence Spanish garrisons were still continued within our country and the running of the boundary line had not been commenced. These circumstances are the more to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a manner injurious to the United States. Still however indulging the hope that the answers which have been given will remove the objections offered by the Spanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty I have judged it proper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to run the line of limits. Further information on this subject will be communicated in the course of the session. In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier it is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate the affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual hostilities against the United States. Great activity has been exerted by those persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes resing within the territory of the United States to influence them to transfer their affections and force to a foreign nation to form them into a confederacy and prepare them for war against the United States. Although measures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights to prevent Indian hostilities and to preserve entire their attachment to the United States it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to these measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such practices a law proving adequate punishment for such offenses may be necessary. The commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity commerce and igation between the United States and Great Britain to ascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace met at Passamaquoddy Bay in 1796 October and ed the mouths of the rivers in question and the adjacent shores and islands and being of opinion that actual surveys of both rivers to their sources were necessary gave to the agents of the two nations instructions for that purpose and adjourned to meet at Boston in August. They met but the surveys requiring more time than had been supposed and not being then completed the commissioners again adjourned to meet at Provence in the State of Rhode Island in June next when we may expect a final examination and decision. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty met at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects for debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from citizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hitherto prevented any determinations but the business is now resumed and doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption. Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses and damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the commissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty. The sums awarded by the commissioners have been pa by the British Government. A conserable number of other claims where costs and damages and not captured property were the only objects in question have been deced by arbitration and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have also been pa. The commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty with Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and dece on the claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between Spain and France. Their sittings have been interrupted but are now resumed. The United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects upon the award of the commissioners acting under the 6th article of the treaty with Great Britain and for the losses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States and brought into their ports or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the United States upon the awards of the commissioners acting under the 7th article of the same treaty it is necessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations. The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French Republic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned conserable expenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their tribunals. The sums required for this purpose have in ers instances been disbursed by the consuls of the United States. By means of the same captures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign countries destitute of all means of subsistence and the sick in particular have been exposed to grievous sufferings. The consuls have in these cases also advanced moneys for their relief. For these advances they reasonably expect reimbursements from the United States. The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment. The provisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are found to be inadequate and ineffectual. Another provision seems necessary to be added to the consular act. Some foreign vessels have been discovered sailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers. It seldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception because they have no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea letters. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:It is my duty to recommend to your serious conseration those objects which by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere  the national debts and taxes. Since the decay of the feudal system by which the public defense was proved for chiefly at the expense of inuals the system of loans has been introduced and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes sufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war the sums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of what have been called funding systems. The consequences arising from the continual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. The national defense must be proved for as well as the support of Government; but both should be accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes and as little as possible by loans. The estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction be la before you. Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:We are met together at a most interesting period. The situation of the principal powers of Europe are singular and portentous. Connected with some by treaties and with all by commerce no important event there can be indifferent to us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not less for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor safety and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of wisdom and firmness. In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.
 FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: It is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the National prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our North Western frontier have terminated.  You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavors toward effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier; to stop the further effusion of blood; to arrest the progress of expense; to forward the prevalent wish of the Nation for peace has led through various channels to strenuous efforts to accomplish these desirable purposes: In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some conserations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; or if not attainable to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case.  A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be la before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened.  In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from Massacre the emissaries of peace. It will I presume be duly consered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.  It must add to your concern to be informed that beses the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes North of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.  A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabitating five Villages on the Tennesee River have been long in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.  It was hoped that the treaty of Holstin made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aed by some Banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the Citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be la before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed.  It is not understood that any breach of Treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their Citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.  I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised has been recruited though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (beses being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a gue to the legislative consultations; and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be adviseable.  In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the Session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostility.  I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your conseration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory. To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to rese among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interests with our's could not but be conserable.  The prosperous state of our Revenue has been intimated. This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessening in local extent and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive.  But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and adviseable; and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.  Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders: and Congress may be assured that nothing within Constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count intirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of Government and upon the zealous support of all good Citizens.  I cannot forbear to bring again into the  of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the Judiciary System. A representation from the Judges of the Supreme Court which will be la before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws conserations arise out of the structure of that System which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the Courts of the United States and supplementary definition of Offences against the Constitution and laws of the Union and of the punishment for such Offences will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention.  Observations on the value of peace with other Nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own Citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign Nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your conseration the means of preventing those aggressions by our Citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of Nations which furnishing just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session.  In execution of the Authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to a in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made for the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of halfdismes; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.  The regulation of foreign Coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed.  It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the PostOffice operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the Country. Should this upon due inquiry be found to be the case a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy. 15 [Note:On December 31 Lear wrote to the Postmaster General: In reply to your letter of this date requesting me to inform you of the facts or representations communicated to the Present relative to newspapers which led him to notice them in his Speech at the opening of the present session of Congress; I have the honor to inform you that it was represented to the Present in such a way as to place the fact beyond a doubt in his mind that in consequence of the rate of postage imposed on the transmission of Newspapers by the Postoffice Law many persons in Virginia who had heretofore taken Newspapers from this City had declined receiving them any longer; and that many others declared that they only continued to take them under a full persuasion that the rate of postage would be reduced during the present Session of Congress and that if such reduction should not take place they would desire the printers to stop their papers.  In addition to these strong marks of disapprobation of the rate of postage on newspapers given by inuals he was informed that the public mind so far as it had been expressed in that quarter on the subject appeared very anxious that an alteration should take place in that part of the post office Law which relates to the transmission of Newspapers.  This letter is entered in the Letter Book in the Washington Papers . ] The adoption of a Constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified to me. The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the Nation to which it relates and conducive to the general Order.  It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the Acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of Florins. One at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one half per Cent with an Allowance of four per Cent in lieu of all charges; and the other two at Amsterdam at the annual interest of four per Cent with an allowance of five and one half per Cent in one case and of five per Cent in the other in lieu of all charges. The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our Credit abroad.  Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign Officers according to the provision made during the last Session has been embraced.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a Systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved served to the Government. No measure can be more desireable whether ed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the Nation.  Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States pursuant to the eleventh section of the Act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made.  Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention.  Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you.  Various temporary laws will expire during the present Session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian Tribes will merit particular notice.  The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of sol and durable advantages to our Constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment to that constitution of Government upon which under Divine Provence materially depend their Union their safety and their happiness.  Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public Councils. 
 Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:  In recurring to the internal situation of our Country since I had last the pleasure to Address you I find ample reason for a renewed expression of that gratitude to the ruler of the Universe which a continued series of prosperity has so often and so justly called forth.   The Acts of the last Session which required special arrangements have been as far as circumstances would admit carried into operation.  Measures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier have been digested and adopted. In the framing of these care has been taken to guard on the one hand our advanced Settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly Inuals who cannot be restrained by their Tribes; and on the other hand to protect the rights secured to the Indians by Treaty; to draw them nearer to the civilized state; and inspire them with correct conceptions of the Power as well as justice of the Government.  The meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain in the State of Georgia which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their land by that State broke up without its being accomplished; the Nation having previous to their departure instructed them against making any Sale; the occasion however has been improved to confirm by a new Treaty with the Creeks their preexisting engagements with the United States; and to obtain their consent to the establishment of Trading Houses and Military Posts within their boundary; by means of which their friendship and the general peace may be more effectually secured.  The period during the late Session at which the appropriation was passed for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity Commerce and Navigation between the United States and his Britannic Majesty necessarily procrastinated the reception of the Posts stipulated to be delivered beyond the date assigned for that event. As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed with propriety on the subject arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their evacuation; and the United States took possession of the principal of them comprehending Oswego Niagara Detroit Michelimackina and Fort Miami; where such repairs and additions have been ordered to be made as appeared indispensible.  The Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain to determine which is the river St. Croix mentioned in the Treaty of peace of 1783 agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson Esqr. of New York for the third Commissioner. The whole met at St. Andrews in Passamaquoddy Bay in the beginning of October; and directed surveys to be made of the Rivers in dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have these Surveys completed before the next Year they adjourned to meet at Boston in August 1797 for the final decision of the question.  Other Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States agreeably to the seventh Article of the Treaty with Great Britain relative to captures and condemnations of Vessels and other property met the Commissioners of his Britannic Majesty in London in August last when John Trumbull Esqr. was chosen by lot for the fifth Commissioner. In October following the Board were to proceed to business. As yet there has been no communication of Commissioners on the part of Great Britain to unite with those who have been appointed on the part of the United States for carrying into effect the sixth Article of the Treaty.  The Treaty with Spain required that the Commissioners for running the boundary line between the territory of the United States and his Catholic Majesty's Provinces of East and West Flora should meet at the Natchez before the expiration of six Months after the exchange of the ratifications which was effected at Aranjuez on the 25th. day of April; and the troops of his Catholic Majesty occupying any Posts within the limits of the United States were within the same period to be withdrawn. The Commissioner of the United States therefore commenced his journey for the Natchez in September; and troops were ordered to occupy the Posts from which the Spanish Garrisons should be withdrawn. Information has been recently received of the appointment of a Commissioner on the part of his Catholic Majesty for running the boundary line but none of any appointment for the adjustment of the claims of our Citizens whose Vessels were captured by the Armed Vessels of Spain.  In pursuance of the Act of Congress passed in the last Session for the protection and relief of American Seamen Agents were appointed one to rese in Great Britain and the other in the West Indies. The effects of the Agency in the West Indies are not yet fully ascertained; but those which have been communicated afford grounds to believe the measure will be beneficial. The Agent destined to rese in Great Britain declining to accept the appointment the business has consequently devolved on the Minister of the United States in London; and will command his attention until a new Agent shall be appointed.  After many delays and disappointments arising out of the European War the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Algiers will in all present appearance be crowned with success: but under great tho' inevitable disadvantages in the pecuniary transactions occasioned by that War; which will render a further provision necessary. The actual liberation of all our Citizens who were prisoners in Algiers while it gratifies every feeling heart is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole negotiation. Measures are in operation for effecting Treaties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.  To an active external Commerce the protection of a Naval force is indispensable. This is manifest with regard to Wars in which a State itself is a party. But beses this it is in our own experience that the most sincere Neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of Nations at War. To secure respect to a Neutral Flag requires a Naval force organized and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression. This may even prevent the necessity of going to War by discouraging belligerent Powers from committing such violations of the rights of the Neutral party as may first or last leave no other option. From the best information I have been able to obtain it would seem as if our trade to the mediterranean without a protecting force will always be insecure; and our Citizens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but just been relieved.  These conserations invite the United States to look to the means and to set about the gradual creation of a Navy. The increasing progress of their Navigation promises them at no distant period the requisite supply of Seamen; and their means in other respects favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement likewise that their particular situation will give weight and influence to a moderate Naval force in their hands. Will it not then be adviseable to begin without delay to prove and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of Ships of War; and to proceed in the Work by degrees in proportion as our resources shall render it practicable without inconvenience; so that a future War of Europe may not find our Commerce in the same unprotected state in which it was found by the present.  Congress have repeatedly and not without success directed their attention to the encouragement of Manufactures. The object is of too much consequence not to insure a continuance of their efforts in every way which shall appear eligible. As a general rule Manufactures on public account are inexpedient. But where the state of things in a Country leaves little hope that certain branches of Manufacture will for a great length of time obtain; when these are of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force in time of War are not establishments for procuring them on public account to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service recommended by strong conserations of National policy as an exception to the general rule? Ought our Country to remain in such cases dependant on foreign supply precarious because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary Articles should in this mode cost more in time of peace will not the security and independence thence arising form an ample compensation? Establishments of this sort commensurate only with the calls of the public service in time of peace will in time of War easily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the Government; and may even perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the supply of our Citizens at large; so as to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade. If adopted the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already or likely soon to be established in the Country; in order that there may be no danger of interference with pursuits of inual industry.  It will not be doubted that with reference either to inual or National Welfare Agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as Nations advance in population and other circumstances of maturity this truth becomes more apparent; and renders the cultivation of the Soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up supported by the public purse: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this end none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of Boards composed of proper characters charged with collecting and diffusing information and enabled by premiums and small pecuniary as to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement; by stimulating to enterprise and experiment and by drawing to a common centre the results everywhere of inual skill and observation; and spreading them thence over the whole Nation. Experience accordingly has shewn that they are very cheap Instruments of immense National benefits.  I have heretofore proposed to the conseration of Congress the expediency of establishing a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desirableness of both these Institutions has so constantly increased with every new  I have taken of the subject that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all recalling your attention to them.  The Assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to be fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the Arts and Sciences contributes to National prosperity and reputation. True it is that our Country much to its honor contains many Seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which they rest are too narrow to command the ablest Professors in the different departments of liberal knowledge for the Institution cond though they would be excellent auxiliaries.  Amongst the motives to such an Institution the assimilation of the principles opinions and manners of our Country men but the common education of a portion of our Youth from every quarter well deserves attention. The more homogeneous our Citizens can be made in these particulars the greater will be our prospect of permanent Union; and a primary object of such a National Institution should be the education of our Youth in the science of Government . In a Republic what species of knowledge can be equally important? and what duty more pressing on its Legislature than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the Country?  The Institution of a Military Academy is also recommended by cogent reasons. However pacific the general policy of a Nation may be it ought never to be without an adequate stock of Military knowledge for emergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character and both would hazard its safety or expose it to greater evils when War could not be avoed. Beses that War might often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims might exempt a Nation from the necessity of practising the rules of the Military Art ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting by proper establishments the knowledge of that Art. Whatever argument may be drawn from particular examples superficially ed a thorough examination of the subject will evince that the Art of War is at once comprehensive and complicated; that it demands much previous study; and that the possession of it in its most improved and perfect state is always of great moment to the security of a Nation. This therefore ought to be a serious care of every Government: and for this purpose an Academy where a regular course of Instruction is given is an obvious expedient which different Nations have successfully employed.  The compensations to the Officers of the United States in various instances and in none more than in respect to the most important stations appear to call for Legislative revision. The consequences of a defective provision are of serious import to the Government. If private wealth is to supply the defect of public retribution it will greatly contract the sphere within which the selection of Characters for Office is to be made and will proportionally diminish the probability of a choice of Men able as well as upright: Beses that it would be repugnant to the vital principles of our Government virtually to exclude from public trusts talents and virtue unless accompanied by wealth.  While in our external relations some serious inconveniences and embarrassments have been overcome and others lessened it is with much pain and deep regret I mention that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred. Our trade has suffered and is suffering extensive injuries in the West Indies from the Cruisers and Agents of the French Republic; and communications have been received from its Minister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our Commerce by its authority; and which are in other respects far from agreeable.  It has been my constant sincere and earnest wish in conformity with that of our Nation to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly understanding with that Republic. This wish remains unabated; and I shall persevere in the endeavour to fulfil it to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with a just and indispensable regard to the rights and honour of our Country; nor will I easily cease to cherish the expectation that a spirit of justice candour and friendship on the part of the Republic will eventually ensure success.  In pursuing this course however I cannot forget what is due to the character of our Government and Nation; or to a full and entire confence in the good sense patriotism selfrespect and fortitude of my Countrymen.  I reserve for a special Message a more particular communication on this interesting subject.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have directed an estimate of the Appropriations necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be submitted from the proper Department; with a  of the public receipts and expenditures to the latest period to which an account can be prepared.  It is with satisfaction I am able to inform you that the Revenues of the United States continue in a state of progressive improvement.  A reinforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public Debt was mentioned in my Address at the opening of the last Session. Some preliminary steps were taken towards it the maturing of which will no doubt engage your zealous attention during the present. I will only add that it will afford me heart felt satisfaction to concur in such further measures as will ascertain to our Country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the Debt. Posterity may have cause to regret if from any motive intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.  Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: My solicitude to see the Militia of the United States placed on an efficient establishment has been so often and so ardently expressed that I shall but barely recall the subject to your  on the present occasion; at the same time that I shall submit to your enquiry whether our Harbours are yet sufficiently secured.  The situation in which I now stand for the last time in the mst of the Representatives of the People of the United States naturally recalls the period when the Administration of the present form of Government commenced; and I cannot omit the occasion to congratulate you and my Country on the success of the experiment; nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations that his Provential care may still be extended to the United States; that the virtue and happiness of the People may be preserved; and that the Government which they have instituted for the protection of their liberties maybe perpetual. 
As the safety and prosperity of nations ultimately and essentially depend on the protection and the blessing of Almighty God and the national acknowledgment of this truth is not only an indispensable duty which the people owe to Him but a duty whose natural influence is favorable to the promotion of that morality and piety without which social happiness can not exist nor the blessings of a free government be enjoyed; and as this duty at all times incumbent is so especially in seasons of difficulty or of danger when existing or threatening calamities the just judgments of God against prevalent iniquity are a loud call to repentance and reformation; and as the United States of America are at present placed in a hazardous and afflictive situation by the unfriendly disposition conduct and demands of a foreign power evinced by repeated refusals to receive our messengers of reconciliation and peace by depredation on our commerce and the infliction of injuries on very many of our fellowcitizens while engaged in their lawful business on the seasunder these conserations it has appeared to me that the duty of imploring the mercy and benediction of Heaven on our country demands at this time a special attention from its inhabitants.< I have therefore thought fit to recommend and I do hereby recommend that Wednesday the 9th day of May next be observed throughout the United States as a day of solemn humiliation fasting and prayer; that the citizens of these States abstaining on that day from their customary worldly occupations offer their devout addresses to the Father of Mercies agreeably to those forms or methods which they have severally adopted as the most suitable and becoming; that all religious congregations do with the deepest humility acknowledge before God the manifold sins and transgressions with which we are justly chargeable as inuals and as a nation beseeching Him at the same time of His infinite grace through the Redeemer of the World freely to remit all our offenses and to incline us by His Holy Spirit to that sincere repentance and reformation which may afford us reason to hope for his inestimable favor and heavenly benediction; that it be made the subject of particular and earnest supplication that our country may be protected from all the dangers which threaten it; that our civil and religious privileges may be preserved inviolate and perpetuated to the latest generations; that our public councils and magistrates may be especially enlightened and directed at this critical period; that the American people may be united in those bonds of amity and mutual confence and inspired with that vigor and fortitude by which they have in times past been so highly distinguished and by which they have obtained such invaluable advantages; that the health of the inhabitants of our land may be preserved and their agriculture commerce fisheries arts and manufactures be blessed and prospered; that the principles of genuine piety and sound morality may influence the minds and govern the lives of every description of our citizens and that the blessings of peace freedom and pure religion may be speedily extended to all the nations of the earth.< And finally I recommend that on the sa day the duties of humiliation and prayer be accompanied by fervent thanksgiving to the Bestower of Every Good Gift not only for His having hitherto protected and preserved the people of these United States in the independent enjoyment of their religious and civil freedom but also for having prospered them in a wonderful progress of population and for conferring on them many and great favors conducive to the happiness and prosperity of a nation.< Given under my hand and the seal of the United States of America at Philadelphia this 23d day of March A. D. 1798 and of the Independence of the sa States the twentysecond.< JOHN ADAMS.< By the Present:< TIMOTHY PICKERING< Secretary of State.
When it was first perceived in early times that no mdle course for America remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country. Relying however on the purity of their intentions the justice of their cause and the integrity and intelligence of the people under an overruling Provence which had so signally protected this country from the first the representatives of this nation then consisting of little more than half its present number not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them and launched into an ocean of uncertainty.< The zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war supplying the place of government commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society. The Confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian and Helvetic confederacies the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever consered. But reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable.< Negligence of its regulations inattention to its recommendations if not disobedience to its authority not only in inuals but in States soon appeared with their melancholy consequences?universal languor jealousies and rivalries of States decline of igation and commerce discouragement of necessary manufactures universal fall in the value of lands and their produce contempt of public and private faith loss of conseration and credit with foreign nations and at length in discontents animosities combinations partial conventions and insurrection threatening some great national calamity.< In this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by their usual good sense presence of mind resolution or integrity. Measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity prove for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty. The public disquisitions discussions and deliberations issued in the present happy Constitution of Government.< Employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions I first saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign country. Irritated by no literary altercation animated by no public debate heated by no party animosity I read it with great satisfaction as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts as an experiment better adapted to the genius character situation and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested. In its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most esteemed and in some States my own native State in particular had contributed to establish. Claiming a right of suffrage in common with my fellowcitizens in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity as well as them and theirs I d not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions in public and in private. It was not then nor has been since any objection to it in my mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor have I ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves in the course of their experience should see and feel to be necessary or expedient and by their representatives in Congress and the State legislatures according to the Constitution itself adopt and ordain.< Returning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things and I have repeatedly la myself under the most serious obligations to support the Constitution. The operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends and from an habitual attention to it satisfaction in its administration and delight in its effects upon the peace order prosperity and happiness of the nation I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it.< What other form of government indeed can so well deserve our esteem and love?< There may be little solity in an ancient ea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences but this is very certain that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing more noble majestic or august than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of Congress of a Government in which the Executive authority as well as that of all the branches of the Legislature are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good. Can anything essential anything more than mere ornament and decoration be added to this by robes and diamonds? Can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people? For it is the people only that are represented. It is their power and majesty that is reflected and only for their good in every legitimate government under whatever form it may appear. The existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people. And what object or conseration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind? If national pre is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs not from power or riches grandeur or glory but from conviction of national innocence information and benevolence.< In the mst of these pleasing eas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free fair virtuous and independent elections. If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends not of the nation for the national good. If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces by fraud or violence by terror intrigue or venality the Government may not be the choice of the American people but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us and not we the people who govern ourselves; and cand men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance.< Such is the amiable and interesting system of government (and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed) which the people of America have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who by a long course of great actions regulated by prudence justice temperance and fortitude conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity has merited the gratitude of his fellowcitizens commanded the highest praises of foreign nations and secured immortal glory with posterity.< In that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services the gratitude of mankind the happy fruits of them to himself and the world which are daily increasing and that splend prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year. His name may be still a rampart and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark against all open or secret enemies of his country's peace. This example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation.< On this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffence; but as something may be expected the occasion I hope will be admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference upon principle of a free republican government formed upon long and serious reflection after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth; if an attachment to the Constitution of the United States and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people expressed in the mode prescribed in it; if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the inual States and a constant caution and delicacy toward the State governments; if an equal and impartial regard to the rights interest honor and happiness of all the States in the Union without preference or regard to a northern or southern an eastern or western position their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments; if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations; if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools colleges universities academies and every institution for propagating knowledge virtue and religion among all es of the people not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and es and of society in all its forms but as the only means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies the spirit of sophistry the spirit of party the spirit of intrigue the profligacy of corruption and the pestilence of foreign influence which is the angel of destruction to elective governments; if a love of equal laws of justice and humanity in the interior administration; if an inclination to improve agriculture commerce and manufacturers for necessity convenience and defense; if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of America and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us and our citizens to be more friendly to them; if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which has been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both Houses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and the public opinion until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress; if a personal esteem for the French nation formed in a resence of seven years chiefly among them and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations; if while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of America and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint; if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellowcitizens by whatever nation and if success can not be obtained to lay the facts before the Legislature that they may conser what further measures the honor and interest of the Government and its constituents demand; if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me at all times and to all nations and maintain peace friendship and benevolence with all the world; if an unshaken confence in the honor spirit and resources of the American people on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived; if elevated eas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life and not obscured but exalted by experience and age; and with humble reverence I feel it to be my duty to add if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians and a fixed resolution to conser a decent respect for Christianity among the best recommendations for the public service can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without effect.< With this great example before me with the sense and spirit the faith and honor the duty and interest of the same American people pledged to support the Constitution of the United States I entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power.< And may that Being who is supreme over all the Patron of Order the Fountain of Justice and the Protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty continue His blessing upon this nation and its Government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His provence.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself of congratulating you on the present favourable prospects of our public affairs. The recent accession of the important State of North Carolina to the Constitution of the United States (of which official information has been received); the rising credit and respectability of our Country; the general and increasing good will towards the Government of the Union and the concord peace and plenty with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree to our national prosperity.In resuming your consultations for the general good you cannot but derive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last Session have been as satisfactory to your Constituents as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a Gracious Provence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present important Session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism firmness and wisdom.Among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of proving for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for War is one of the most effectual means of perserving peace.A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite: And their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent on others for essential particularly for military supplies.The proper establishment of the Troops which may be deemed indispensable will be entitled to mature deliberation. In the arrangements which may be made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the Officers and Soldiers with a due regard to oeconomy.There was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the Inhabitants of our Southern and Western frontiers from their depredations. But you will perceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall direct to be la before you (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union; and if necessary to punish aggressors.The interests of the United States requires that our intercourse with other nations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me to fulfill my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances may render most conducive to the public good: And to this end that the compensations to be made to the persons who may be employed should according to the nature of their appointments be defined by law; and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses incent to the conduct of our foreign affairs.Various conserations also render it expedient that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of Citizens should be speedily ascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.Uniformity in the Currency Weights and Measures of the United States is an object of great importance and will I am persuaded be duly attended to.The advancement of Agriculture Commerce and Manufactures by all proper means will not I trust need recommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home; and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our Country by a due attention to the PostOffice and PostRoads.Nor am I less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that there is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of Science and Literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness. In one in which the measures of Government receive their impression so immediately from the sense of the Community as in ours it is proportionably essential. To the security of a free Constitution it contributes in various ways: By convincing those who are intrusted with the public administration that every valuable end of Government is best answered by the enlightened confence of the people: and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights; to discern and prove against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of Society; to discriminate the spirit of Liberty from that of licentiousness cherishing the first avoing the last and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments with an inviolable respect to the Laws.Whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording as to seminaries of learning already established by the institution of a national University or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of the Legislature.
The period for a new election of a citizen to administer the Executive Government of the United States being not far distant and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust it appears to me proper especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed to decline being consered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.< I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the conserations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in my Situation might imply I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both.< The acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confence impelled me to abandon the ea. I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as internal no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded whatever partiality may be retained for my services that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire.< The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust I will only say that I have with good intentions contributed toward the organization and administration of the Government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications experience in my own eyes perhaps still more in the eyes of others has strengthened the motives to diffence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were temporary I have the consolation to believe that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene patriotism does not forb it.< In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confence with which it has supported me and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead; amst appearances sometimes dubious; vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging; in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and a guaranty of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this ea I shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that in fine the happiness of the people of these States under the auspices of liberty may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the  the affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.< Here perhaps I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent re some sentiments which are the result of much reflection of no inconserable observation and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion.< Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.< The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence the support of your tranquillity at home your peace abroad of your safety of your prosperity of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insiously) directed it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and inual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.< For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens by birth or choice of a common country that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American which belongs to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pre of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference you have the same religion manners habits and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts of common dangers sufferings and successes.< But these conserations however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole.< The North in an unrestrained intercourse with the South protected by the equal laws of a common government finds in the productions of the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South in the same intercourse benefiting by the same agency of the North sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the North it finds its particular igation invigorated; and while it contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national igation it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East in a like intercourse with the West already finds and in the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and water will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth and comfort and what is perhaps of still greater consequence it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight influence and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic se of the Union directed by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power must be intrinsically precarious.< While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union all the parts combined can not fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength greater resource proportionably greater security from external danger a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations and what is of inestimable value they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce but which opposite foreign alliances attachments and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter. Hence likewise they will avo the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which under any form of government are inauspicious to liberty and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is that your union ought to be consered as a main prop of your liberty and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other.< These conserations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subisions will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.< In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminationsNorthern and Southern Atlantic and Western whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and s. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the negotiation by the Executive and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate of the treaty with Spain and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties that with Great Britain and that with Spainwhich secure to them everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations toward confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers if such there are who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?< To the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole is indispensable. No alliances however strict between the parts can be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth you have improved upon your first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This Government the offspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation completely free in its principles in the distribution of its powers uniting security with energy and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment has a just claim to your confence and your support. Respect for its authority compliance with its laws acquiescence in its measures are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very ea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every inual to obey the established government.< All obstructions to the execution of the laws all combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct control counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties to snake the public administration the mirror of the illconcerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.< However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying. afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.< Toward the preservation of your Government and the permanency of your present happy state it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country; that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will find in such a government with powers properly distributed and adjusted its surest guardian. It is indeed little else than a name where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.< I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive  and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.< This spirit unfortunately is inseparable from our nature having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments more or less stifled controlled or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.< The alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horr enormities is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an inual and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.< Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.< It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with illrounded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.< There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence if not with favor upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character in governments purely elective it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest instead of warming it should consume.< It is important likewise that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres avoing in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power by ing and distributing it into different depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.< Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happinessthese firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked Where is the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forb us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.< It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric? Promote then as an object of primary importance institutions 'for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.< As a very important source of strength and security cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible avoing occasions of expense by cultivating peace but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoing likewise the accumulation of debt not only by shunning occasions of expense but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which uoable wars have occasioned not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives; but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a decisive motive for a cand construction of the conduct of the Government in making it and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.< Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct. And can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free enlightened and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always gued by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it? Can it be that Provence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment at least is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?< In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage and to be haughty and intractable when accental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.< Hence frequent collisions obstinate envenomed and bloody contests. The nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through passion what reason would reject. At other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pre ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations has been the victim.< So likewise a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities of the other betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained and by exciting jealousy ill will and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld; and it gives to ambitions corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition corruption or infatuation.< As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions to practice the arts of seduction to mislead public opinion to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter. Against the insious wiles of foreign influence ( I conjure you to believe me fellowcitizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoed instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one se and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious while its tools and dupes usurp the  and confence of the people to surrender their interests.< The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.< Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.< Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people under an efficient government the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war as our interest gued by justice shall counsel.< Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice?< It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world so far I mean as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always. the best policy. I repeat therefore let those engagements be unwise to extend them.< Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.< Harmony liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy humanity and interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and ersifying by gentle means the streams of commerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed in order to give trade a stable course to define the rights of our merchants and to enable the Government to support them conventional rules of intercourse the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in  that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure which a just pre ought to discard.< In offering to you my countrymen these counsels of an old and affectionate friend I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wishthat they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefi
 some occasional goodthat they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated.< How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been gued by the principles which have been delineated the public records and other evences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To myself the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least believed myself to be gued by them.< In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe my proclamation of the 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your representatives in both Houses of Congress the spirit of that measure has continually governed me uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or ert me from it.< After deliberate examination with the a of the best lights I could obtain I was well satisfied that our country under all the circumstances of the case had a right to take and was bound in duty and interest to take a neutral position. Having taken it I determined as far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation perseverance and firmness.< The conserations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that according to my understanding of the matter that right so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers has been virtually admitted by all.< The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without anything more from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation in cases in which it is free to act to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity toward other nations.< The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it humanly speaking the command of its own fortunes.< Though in reing the incents of my Administration I am unconscious of intentional error I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to  them with indulgence and that after fortyfive years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.< Relying on its kindness in this as in other things and actuated by that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who s in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the mst of my fellowcitizens the benign influence of good laws under a free governmentthe everfavorite object of my heart and the happy reward as I trust of our mutual cares labors and dangers.
FellowCitizens:< I am again called upon by the voice of my Country to execute the s of its Chief Magistrate. When the occasion proper for it shall arrive I shall endeavour to express the high sense I entertain of this distinguished honor and of the confence which has been reposed in me by the people of United America.< Previous to the execution of any official act of the Present the Constitution requires an Oath of Office. This Oath I am now about to take and in your presence 56 that if it shall be found during my administration of the Government I have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the injunction thereof I may (beses incurring Constitutional punishmt) be subject to the upbraings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn Ceremony.
 Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: When we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven by which the American People became a nation; when we survey the general prosperity of our country and look forward to the riches power and happiness to which it seems destined; with the deepest regret do I announce to you that during your recess some of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of an insurrection. It is due however to the character of our government and to its stability which cannot be shaken by the enemies of order freely to unfold the course of this event.  During the session of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety it was expedient to exercise the legislative power granted by the constitution of the United States to lay and collect excises. In a majority of the States scarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In some indeed alarms were at first conceived until they were banished by reason and patriotism. In the four western counties of Pennsylvania a prejudice fostered and embittered by the artifice of men who labored for an ascendency over the will of others by the guance of their passions produced symptoms of riot and violence. It is well known that Congress d not hesitate to examine the complaints which were presented and to relieve them as far as justice dictated or general convenience would permit But the impression which this moderation made on the discontented d not correspond with what it deserved. The arts of delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing inuals.  The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws; and associations of men began to denounce threats against the officers employed. From a belief that by a more formal concert their operation might be defeated certain selfcreated societies 36 assumed the tone of condemnation. Hence while the greater part of Pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves to the acts of excise a few counties were resolved to frustrate them. It was now perceived that every expectation from the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued was uailing and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the government. Legal process was therefore delivered to the marshal against the rioters and delinquent distillers.  No sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty than the vengeance of armed men was aimed at his person and the person and property of the inspector of the revenue. They fired upon the marshal arrested him and detained him for some time as a prisoner. was obliged by the jeopardy of his life to renounce the service of other process on the west se of the Allegeny mountain; and a deputation was afterwards sent to him to demand a surrender of that which he had served. A numerous body repeatedly attacked the house of the inspector seized his papers of office and finally destroyed by fire his buildings and whatsoever they contained. Both of these officers from a just regard to their safety fled to the seat of government; it being avowed that the motives to such outrages were to compel the resignation of the inspector to withstand by force of arms the authority of the United States and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws of excise and an alteration in the conduct of government.  Upon the testimony of these facts an associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States notified to me that in the counties of Washington and Allegeny in Pennsylvania laws of the United States were opposed and the execution thereof obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshal of that district. On this call momentous in the extreme I sought and weighed what might best subdue the crisis. On the one hand the judiciary was pronounced to be stripped of its capacity to enforce the laws; crimes which reached the very existence of social order were perpetrated without controul the friends of government were insulted abused and overawed into silence or an apparent acquiescence; and the yield to the treasonable fury of so small a portion of the United States would be to violate the fundamental principle of our constitution which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail. On the other to array citizen against citizen to publish the dishonor of such excesses to encounter the expense and other embarrassments of so distant an expedition were steps too delicate too closely interwoven with many affecting conserations to be lightly adopted. I postponed therefore the summoning of the militia immediately into the field. But I required them to be held in readiness that if my anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded and to convince the malignant of their danger should be fruitless military force might be prepared to act before the season should be too far advanced.  My Proclamation of the 7th of August last was accordingly issued and accompanied by the appointment of Commissioners who were charged to repair to the scene of insurrection. They were authorized to confer with any bodies of men or inuals. They were instructed to be cand and explicit in stating the sensations which had been excited in the Executive and his earnest wish to avo a resort to coercion. To represent however that without submission coercion must be the resort; but to invite them at the same time to return to the demeanor of faithful citizens by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of the executive power. Pardon too was tendered to them by the government of the United States and that of Pennsylvania upon no other condition than a satisfactory assurance of obedience to the laws.  Although the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and abilities and must unite all virtuous men by shewing that the means of conciliation have been exhausted all of those who had committed or abetted the tumults d not subscribe the mild form which was proposed as the atonement; and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither sufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant a further suspension of the march of the militia.  Thus the painful alternative could not be discarded. I ordered the militia to march after once more admonishing the insurgents in my proclamation of the 25th of September last.  It was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the lowest degree of force competent to the quelling of the insurrection. From a respect indeed to oeconomy and the ease of my fellow citizens belonging to the militia it would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate. My very reluctance to ascribe too much importance to the opposition had its extent been accurately seen would have been a deced inducement to the smallest efficient numbers. In this uncertainty therefore I put in motion fifteen thousand men as being an army which according to all human calculation would be prompt and adequate in every ; and might perhaps by rendering resistance desperate prevent the effusion of blood. Quotas had been assigned to the states of NewJersey Pennsylvania Maryland and Virginia; the governor of Pennsylvania having declared on this occasion an opinion which justified a requisition to the other states.  As commander in chief of the militia when called into the actual service of the United States I have visited the places of general rendezvous to obtain more exact information and to direct a plan for ulterior movements. Had there been room for a persuasion that the laws were secure from obstruction; that the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such of the most culpable as have not embraced the proffered terms of amnesty and may be deemed fit objects of example; that the friends to peace and good government were not in need of that a and countenance which they ought always to receive and I trust ever will receive against the vicious and turbulent; I should have caught with avity the opportunity of restoring the militia to their families and home. But succeeding intelligence has tended to manifest the necessity of what has been done; it being now confessed by those who were not inclined to exaggerate the illconduct of the insurgents that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a particular law; but that a spirit inimical to all order has actuated many of the offenders. If the state of things had afforded reason for the continuance of my presence with the army it would not have been withholden. But every appearance assuring such an issue as will redound to the reputation and strength of the United States I have judged it most proper to resume my duties at the seat of government leaving the chief command with the governor of Virginia.  Still however as it is probable that in a commotion like the present whatsoever may be the pretence the purposes of mischief and revenge may not be la ase; the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the four western counties of Pennsylvania will be indispensable; whether we con the situation of those who are connected with the execution of the laws; or of others who may have exposed themselves by an honorable attachment to them.  Thirty days from the commencement of this session being the legal limitation of the employment of the militia Congress cannot be too early occupied with this subject.  Among the discussions which may arise from this aspect of our affairs and from the documents which will be submitted to Congress it will not escape their observation that not only the inspector of the revenue but other officers of the United States in Pennsylvania have from their felity in the discharge of their s sustained material injuries to their property. The obligation and policy of indemnifying them are strong and obvious. It may also merit attention whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizens who though not under the ties of office may have suffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the constitution and the laws. The amount even if all the injured were included would not be great; and on future emergencies the government would be amply repa by the influence of an example that he who incurs a loss in its defence shall find a recompense in its liberality.  While there is cause to lament that occurrences of this nature should have disgraced the name or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of our community or should have erted to a new application any portion of the public resources there are not wanting real and substantial consolations for the misfortune. It has demonstrated that our prosperity rests on sol foundations; by furnishing an additional proof that my fellow citizens understand the true principles of government and liberty: that they feel their inseparable union: that notwithstanding all the devices which have been used to sway them from their interest and duty they are now as ready to maintain the authority of the laws against licentious invasions as they were to defend their rights against usurpation. It has been a spectacle displaying to the highest advantage the value of Republican Government to behold the most and least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks as private soldiers; preeminently distinguished by being the army of the constitution; undeterred by a march of three hundred miles over rugged mountains by the approach of an inclement season or by any other discouragement. Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic cooperation which I have experienced from the chief magistrates of the states to which my requisitions have been addressed.  To every description indeed of citizens let praise be given. But let them persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depository of American happiness the constitution of the United States. Let them cherish it too for the sake of those who from every clime are daily seeking a dwelling in our land. And when in the calm moments of reflection they shall have retraced the origin and progress of the insurrection let them determine whether it has not been fomented by combinations of men who careless of consequences and disregarding the unerring truth that those who rouse cannot always appease a civil convulsion have disseminated from an ignorance or version of facts suspicions jealousies and accusations of the whole government.  Having thus fulfilled the engagement which I took when I entered into office to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the United States on you Gentlemen and the people by whom you are deputed I rely for support.  In the arrangements to which the possibility of a similar contingency will naturally draw your attention it ought not to be forgotten that the militia laws have exhibited such striking defects as could not have been supplied but by the zeal of our citizens. Beses the extraordinary expense and waste which are not the least of the defects every appeal to those laws is attended with a doubt of its success.  The devising and establishing of a well regulated militia would be a genuine source of legislative honor and a perfect title to public gratitude. I therefore entertain a hope that the present session will not pass without carrying to its full energy the power of organizing arming and disciplining the militia; and thus proving in the language of the constitution for calling them forth to execute the laws of the union suppress insurrections and repel invasions.  As auxiliary to the state of our defence to which Congress can never too frequently recur they will not omit to enquire whether the fortifications which have been already licensed by law be commensurate with our exigencies.  The intelligence from the army under the command of general Wayne is a happy presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians north of the Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded the advance which he has made must have damped the ardor of the savages and weakened their obstinacy in waging war against the United States. And yet even at this late hour when our power to punish them cannot be questioned we shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting peace upon terms of candor equity and good neighborhood.  Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been spared. The Creeks in particular are covered from encroachment by the interposition of the General Government and that of Georgia. From a desire also to remove the discontents of the Six Nations a settlement meditated at Presqu'isle on Lake Erie has been suspended; and an agent is now endeavoring to rectify any misconception into which they may have fallen. But I cannot refrain from again pressing upon your deliberations the plan which I recommended at the last session for the improvement of harmony with all the Indians within our limits by the fixing and conducting of trading houses upon the principles then expressed.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The time which has elapsed since the commencement of our fiscal measures has developed our pecuniary resources so as to open a way for a definitive plan for the redemption of the public debt. It is believed that the result is such as to encourage Congress to consummate this work without delay. Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the nation and nothing would be more grateful to our constituents. Indeed whatsoever is unfinished of our system of public credit cannot be benefited by procrastination; and as far as may be practicable we ought to place that credit on grounds which cannot be disturbed and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all governments.  An estimate of the necessary appropriations including the expenditures into which we have been driven by the insurrection will be submitted to Congress.  Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals; and conserable sums of defective coins and bullion have been lodged with the director by inuals. There is a pleasing prospect that the institution will at no remote day realize the expectation which was originally formed of its utility.  In subsequent communications certain circumstances of our intercourse with foreign nations will be transmitted to Congress. However it may not be unseasonable to announce that my policy in our foreign transactions has been to cultivate peace with all the world; to observe treaties with pure and absolute faith; to check every deviation from the line of impartiality; to explain what may have been misapprehended and correct what may have been injurious to any nation; and having thus acquired the right to lose no time in acquiring the ability to insist upon justice being done to ourselves.  Let us unite therefore in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations to spread his holy protection over these United States: to turn the machinations of the wicked to the confirming of our constitution: to enable us at all times to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight: to perpetuate to our country that prosperity which his goodness has already conferred and to verify the anticipations of this government being a safe guard to human rights.
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:< The letter herewith transmitted will inform you that it has pleased Divine Provence to remove from this life our excellent fellowcitizen George Washington by the purity of his character and a long series of services to his country rendered illustrious through the world. It remains for an affectionate and grateful people in whose hearts he can never die to pay suitable honors to his memory.< JOHN ADAMS.< MOUNT VERNON December 15 1799.< The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.< SIR: It is with inexpressible grief that I have to announce to you the death of the great and good General Washington. died last evening between 10 and 11 o'clock after a short illness of about twenty hours. His disorder was an inflamatory sore throat which proceeded from a cold of which he made but little complaint on Fray. On Saturday morning about 3 o'clock he became ill. Dr. Craik attended him in the morning and Dr. Dick of Alexandria and Dr. Brown of Port Tobacco were soon after called in. Every medical assistance was offered but without the desired effect. His last scene corresponded with the whole tenor of his life; not a groan nor a complaint escaped him in extreme distress. With perfect resignation and in full possession of his reason he closed his wellspent life.< I have the honor to be with the highest respect sir your most obedient and very humble servant< TOBIAS LEAR.< The Senate having resolved to wait on the Present of the United States to condole with him on the distressing event of the death of General George Washington proceeded to the house of the Present when the Present of the Senate in their name presented the address which had previously been agreed to as follows:< The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:< The Senate of the United States respectfully take leave sir to to you their deep regret for the loss their country sustains in the death of General George Washington.< This event so distressing to all our fellowcitizens must be peculiarly heavy to you who have long been associated with him in deeds of patriotism. Permit us sir to mingle our tears with yours. On this occasion it is manly to weep. To lose such a man at such a crisis is no common calamity to the world. Our country mourns her father. The Almighty Disposer of Human Events has taken from us our greatest benefactor and ornament. It becomes us to submit with reverence to Him who maketh darkness His pavilion.< With patriotic pre we re the life of our Washington and compare him with those of other countries who have been preeminent in fame. Ancient and modern names are diminished before him. Greatness and guilt have too often been allied but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant. The destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue. It reproved the intemperance of their ambition and darkened the splendor of victory. The scene is closed and we are no longer anxious lest misfortune should sully his glory. has traveled on to the end of his journey and carried with him an increasing weight of honor. has deposited it safely where misfortune can not tarnish it where malice can not blast it. Favored of Heaven he departed without exhibiting the weakness of humanity. Magnanimous in death the darkness of the grave could not obscure his brightness.< Such was the man whom we deplore. Thanks to God his glory is consummated. Washington yet lives on earth in his spotless example; his spirit is in Heaven.< Let his countrymen consecrate the memory of the heroic general the patriotic statesman and the virtuous sage. Let them teach their children never to forget that the fruit of his labors and his example are their inheritance.< SAMUEL LIVERMORE< Present of the Senate pro tempore.< DECEMBER 23 1799.< To which the Present replied as follows:< UNITED STATES  December 23 1799.< Gentlemen of the Senate:< I receive with the most respectful and affectionate sentiments in this impressive address the obliging expressions of your regard for the loss our country has sustained in the death of her most esteemed beloved and admired citizen.< In the multitude of my thoughts and recollections on this melancholy event you will permit me only to say that I have seen him in the days of adversity in some of the scenes of his deepest distress and most trying perplexities; I have also attended him in his highest elevation and most prosperous felicity with uniform admiration of his wisdom moderation and constancy.< Among all our original associates in that memorable league of the continent in 1774 which first expressed the sovereign will of a free nation in America he was the only one remaining in the General Government. Although with a constitution more enfeebled than his at an age when he thought it necessary to prepare for retirement I feel myself alone bereaved of my last brother; yet I derive a strong consolation from the unanimous disposition which appears in all ages and es to mingle their sorrows with mine on this common calamity to the world.< The life of our Washington can not suffer by comparison with those of other countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame. The attributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to eclipse the majesty of those virtues which made him from being a modest citizen a more resplendent luminary.< Misfortune had he lived could hereafter have sullied his glory only with those superficial minds who believing that characters and actions are marked by success alone rarely deserve to enjoy it. Malice could never blast his honor and envy made him a singular exception to her universal rule. For himself he had lived enough to life and to glory. For his fellowcitizens if their prayers could have been answered he would have been immortal. For me his departure is at a most unfortunate moment. Trusting however in the wise and righteous dominion of Provence over the passions of men and the results of their councils and actions as well as over their lives nothing remains for me but humble resignation.< His example is now complete and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates citizens and men not only in the present age but in future generations as long as our history shall be read. If a Trajan found a Pliny a Marcus Aurelius can never want biographers eulogists or historians.< JOHN ADAMS.< The House of Representatives having resolved unanimously to wait on the Present of the United States in condolence of this national calamity the Speaker attended by the House withdrew to the house of the Present when the Speaker addressed the Present as follows:< SIR: The House of Representatives penetrated with a sense of the irreparable loss sustained by the nation in the death of that great and good man the illustrious and beloved Washington wait on you sir to express their condolence on this melancholy and distressing event.< To which the Present replied as follows:< UNITED STATES December 19 1799.< Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:< I receive with great respect and affection the condolence of the House of Representatives on the melancholy and affecting event in the death of the most illustrious and beloved personage which this country ever produced. I sympathize with you with the nation and with good men through the world in this irreparable loss sustained by us all.< JOHN ADAMS.
 Whereas the commissioners appointed by the Present of the United States to confer with the citizens in the western counties of Pennsylvania during the late insurrection which prevailed therein by their act and agreement bearing date the 2d day of September last in pursuance of the powers in them vested d promise and engage that if assurances of submission to the laws of the United States should be bona fe given by the citizens resent in the fourth survey of Pennsylvania in the manner and within the time in the sa act and agreement specified a general pardon should be granted on the 10th day of July then next ensuing of all treasons and other indictable offenses against the United States committed within the sa survey before the 22d day of August last excluding therefrom nevertheless every person who should refuse or neglect to subscribe such assurance and engagement in manner aforesa or who should after such subscription violate the same or will fully obstruct or attempt to obstruct the execution of the acts for raising a revenue on distilled spirits and stills or be aing or abetting therein; and  Whereas I have since thought proper to extend' the sa pardon to all persons guilty of the sa treasons misprisions of treasons or otherwise concerned in the late insurrection within the survey aforesa who have not since been indicted or convicted thereof or of any other offense against the United States:  Therefore be it known that I George Washington Present of the sa United States have granted and by these presents do grant a full free and entire pardon to all persons (excepting as is hereinafter excepted) of all treasons misprisions of treason and other indictable offenses against the United States committed within the fourth survey of Pennsylvania before the sa 22d day of August last past excepting and excluding therefrom nevertheless every person who refused or neglected to give and subscribe the sa assurances in the manner aforesa (or having subscribed hath violated the same) and now standeth indicted or convicted of any treason misprision of treason or other offense against the sa United States hereby remitting and releasing unto all persons except as before excepted all penalties incurred or supposed to be incurred for or on account of the premises.
 Whereas from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution and laws of the United States in certain of the Western counties of Pennsylvania would yield to time and reflection I thought it sufficient in the first instance rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody them; but the moment is now come when the overtures of forgiveness with no other condition than a submission to law have been only partially accepted; when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government has been adopted without effect; when the welldisposed in those counties are unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury and are compelled to associate in their own defence; when the proffered lenity has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will march with reluctance; when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when it is manifest that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to enforce the laws; when therefore Government is set at defiance the contest being whether a small proportion of the United States shall dictate to the whole Union and at the expense of those who desire peace indulge a desperate ambition;  Now therefore I George Washington Present of the United States in obedience to that high and irresistible duty consigned to me by the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; deploring that the American name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their: own Government; commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion; but resolved in perfect reliance on that gracious Provence which so signally displays its goodness towards this country to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the laws; do hereby declare and make known that with a satisfaction which can be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the States of New Jersey Pennsylvania Maryland and Virginia I have received intelligence of their patriotic alacrity in obeying the call of the present though painful yet commanding necessity; that a force which according to every reasonable expectation is adequate to the exigency is already in motion to the scene of disaffection; that those who have confed or shall confe in the protection of Government shall meet full succor under the standard and from the arms of the United States; that those who having offended against the laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity will be treated with the most liberal good faith if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent conduct and that instructions are given accordingly.  And I do moreover exhort all inuals officers and bodies of men to con with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those crimes which produce this resort to military coercion; to check in their respective spheres the efforts of misgued or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation in the place of truth and their discontents in the place of stable government; and to call to mind that as the people of the United States have been permitted under the Divine favor in perfect freedom after solemn deliberation in an enlightened age to elect their own Government so will their gratitude for this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain the Constitution and the laws.  And lastly I again warn all persons whomsoever and whersoever not to abet a or comfort the insurgents aforesa as they will answer the contrary at their peril; and I do also require all officers and other citizens according to their several duties as far as may be in their power to bring under the cognizance of the law all offenders in the premises.
 Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:  With the utmost attention I have consered your resolution of the 24th. instant requesting me to lay before your House a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United States who negotiated the Treaty with the King of Great Britain together with the correspondence and other documents relative to that Treaty excepting such of the sa papers as any existing negotiation may render improper to be disclosed.   In deliberating upon this subject it was impossible for me to lose sight of the principle which some have avowed in its discussion; or to avo extending my s to the consequences which must flow from the admission of that principle.  I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to withhold any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon the Present as a duty to give or which could be required of him by either House of Congress as a right; And with truth I affirm that it has been as it will continue to be while I have the honor to prese in the Government my constant endeavour to harmonize with the other branches thereof; so far as the trust delegated to me by the People of the United States and my sense of the obligation it imposes to preserve protect and defend the Constitution will permit.  The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution; and their success must often depend on secrecy: and even when brought to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measures demands or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or cond would be extremely impolitic: for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations; or produce immediate inconveniences perhaps danger and mischief in relation to other powers. The necessity of such caution and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making Treaties in the Present with the advice and consent of the Senate the principle on which that body was formed confining it to a small number of Members.  To admit then a right in the House of Representatives to demand and to have as a matter of course all the Papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign power would be to establish a dangerous precedent.  It does not occur that the inspection of the papers asked for be relative to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of Representatives except that of an impeachment which the resolution has not expressed. I repeat that I have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of my station will permit or the public good shall require to be disclosed: and in fact all the Papers affecting the negotiation with Great Britain were la before the Senate when the Treaty itself was communicated for their conseration and advice.  The course which the debate has taken on the resolution of the House leads to some observations on the mode of making treaties under the Constitution of the United States.  Having been a member of the General Convention and knowing the principles on which the Constitution was formed I have ever entertained but one opinion on this subject; and from the first establishment of the Government to this moment my conduct has exemplified that opinion that the power of making treaties is exclusively vested in the Present by and with the advice and consent of the Senate proved two thirds of the Senators present concur and that every treaty so made and promulgated thenceforward became the Law of the land. It is thus that the treaty making power has been understood by foreign Nations: and in all the treaties made with them we have declared and they have believed that when ratified by the Present with the advice and consent of the Senate they became obligatory. In this construction of the Constitution every House of Representatives has heretofore acquiesced; and until the present time not a doubt or suspicion has appeared to my knowledge that this construction was not the true one. Nay they have more than acquiesced: for till now without controverting the obligation of such treaties they have made all the requisite provisions for carrying them into effect.  There is also reason to believe that this construction agrees with the opinions entertained by the State Conventions when they were deliberating on the Constitution; especially by those who objected to it because there was not required in commercial treaties the consent of two thirds of the whole number of the members of the Senate instead of two thirds of the Senators present; and because in treaties respecting territorial and certain other rights and claims the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both houses respectively was not made necessary.  It is a fact declared by the General Convention and universally understood that the Constitution of the United States was the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession. And it is well known that under this influence the smaller States were admitted to an equal representation in the Senate with the larger States; and that this branch of the government was invested with great powers: for on the equal participation of those powers the sovereignty anolitical safety of the smaller States were deemed essentially to depend.  If other proofs than these and the plain letter of the Constitution itself be necessary to ascertain the point under conseration they may be found in the journals of the General Convention which I have deposited in the office of the department of State. In these journals it will appear that a proposition was made that no Treaty should be binding on the United States which was not ratified by a Law; and that the proposition was explicitly rejected.  As therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding that file assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the vality of a treaty: as the treaty with Great Britain exhibits in itself all the objects requiring legislative provision; And on these the papers called for can throw no light: And as it is essential to the due administration of the government that the boundaries fixed by the constitution between the different departments should be preserved: A just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my Office under all the circumstances of this case forbs a complyance with your request.<
Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the provence of Almighty God to obey his will to be grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and favor and Whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was that is or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks for his kind care and protection of the People of this country previous to their becoming a Nation for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of his provence which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war for the great degree of tranquillity union and plenty which we have since enjoyed for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness and particularly the national One now lately instituted for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions to enable us all whether in public or private stations to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually to render our national government a blessing to all the People by constantly being a government of wise just and constitutional laws discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed to protect and gue all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government peace and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue and the encrease of science among them and Us and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:Immediately after the adjournment of Congress at their last session in Philadelphia I gave directions in compliance with the laws for the removal of the public offices records and property. These directions have been executed and the public officers have since resed and conducted the ordinary business of the Government in this place. I congratulate the people of the United States on the assembling of Congress at the permanent seat of their Government and I congratulate you gentlemen on the prospect of a resence not to be changed. Although there is cause to apprehend that accommodations are not now so complete as might be wished yet there is great reason to believe that this inconvenience will cease with the present session. It would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to assemble for the first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and imploring His blessing. May this territory be the resence of virtue and happiness! In this city may that piety and virtue that wisdom and magnanimity that constancy and selfgovernment which adorned the great character whose name it bears be forever held in veneration! Here and throughout our country may simple manners pure morals and true religion flourish forever! It is with you gentlemen to conser whether the local powers over the District of Columbia vested by the Constitution in the Congress of the United States shall be immediately exercised. If in your opinion this important trust ought now to be executed you can not fail while performing it to take into  the future probable situation of the territory for the happiness of which you are about to prove. You will conser it as the capital of a great nation advancing with unexampled rapity in arts in commerce in wealth and in population and possessing within itself those energies and resources which if not thrown away or lamentably misdirected will secure to it a long course of prosperity and selfgovernment. In compliance with a law of the last session of Congress the officers and soldiers of the temporary army have been discharged. It affords real pleasure to recollect the honorable testimony they gave of the patriotic motives which brought them into the service of their country by the readiness and regularity with which they returned to the station of private citizens. It is in every point of  of such primary importance to carry the laws into prompt and faithful execution and to render that part of the administration of justice which the Constitution and laws devolve on the Federal courts as convenient to the people as may consist with their present circumstances that I can not omit once more to recommend to your serious conseration the judiciary system of the United States. No subject is more interesting than this to the public happiness and to none can those improvements which may have been suggested by experience be more beneficially applied. A treaty of amity and commerce with the King of Prussia has been concluded and ratified. The ratifications have been exchanged and I have directed the treaty to be promulgated by proclamation. The difficulties which suspended the execution of the 6th article of our treaty of amity commerce and igation with Great Britain have not yet been removed. The negotiation on this subject is still depending. As it must be fore the interest and honor of both nations to adjust this difference with good faith I indulge confently the expectation that the sincere endeavors of the Government of the United States to bring it to an amicable termination will not be disappointed. The envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary from the United States to France were received by the First Consul with the respect due to their character and 3 persons with equal powers were appointed to treat with them. Although at the date of the last official intelligence the negotiation had not terminated yet it is to be hoped that our efforts to effect an accommodation will at length meet with a success proportioned to the sincerity with which they have been so often repeated. While our best endeavors for the preservation of harmony with all nations will continue to be used the experience of the world and our own experience admonish us of the insecurity of trusting too confently to their success. We can not without committing a dangerous imprudence abandon those measures of self protection which are adapted to our situation and to which notwithstanding our pacific policy the violence and injustice of others may again compel us to resort. While our vast extent of sea coast the commercial and agriculture habits of our people the great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean suggest the system of defense which will be most beneficial to ourselves our distance from Europe and our resources for maritime strength will enable us to employ it with effect. Seasonable and systematic arrangements so far as our resources will justify for a y adapted to defensive war and which may in case of necessity be quickly brought into use seem to be as much recommended by a wise and true economy as by a just regard for our future tranquillity for the safety of our shores and for the protection of our property committed to the ocean. The present Navy of the United States called suddenly into existence by a great national exigency has raised us in our own esteem and by the protection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our expectations the objects for which it was created. In connection with a y ought to be cond the fortification of some of our principal sea ports and harbors. A variety of conserations which will readily suggest themselves urge an attention to this measure of precaution. To give security to our principal ports conserable sums have already been expended but the works remain incomplete. It is for Congress to determine whether additional appropriations shall be made in order to render competent to the intended purposes the fortifications which have been commenced. The manufacture of arms within the United States still invites the attention of the National Legislature. At a conserable expense to the public this manufacture has been brought to such a state of maturity as with continued encouragement will supersede the necessity of future importations from foreign countries. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:I shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the ensuing year together with an account of the public revenue and expenditure to a late period to be la before you. I observe with much satisfaction that the product of the revenue during the present year has been more conserable than during any former equal period. This result affords conclusive evence of the great resources of this country and of the wisdom and efficiency of the measures which have been adopted by Congress for the protection of commerce and preservation of public credit. Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:As one of the grand community of nations our attention is irresistibly drawn to the important scenes which surround us. If they have exhibited an uncommon portion of calamity it is the province of humanity to deplore and of wisdom to avo the causes which may have produced it. If turning our eyes homeward we find reason to rejoice at the prospect which presents itself; if we perceive the interior of our country prosperous free and happy; if all enjoy in safety under the protection of laws emanating only from the general will the fruits of their own labor we ought to fortify and cling to those institutions which have been the source of such real felicity and resist with unabating perseverance the progress of those dangerous innovations which may diminish their influence. To your patriotism gentlemen has been confed the honorable duty of guarding the public interests; and while the past is to your country a sure pledge that it will be faithfully discharged permit me to assure you that your labors to promote the general happiness will receive from me the most zealous cooperation. 
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:While with reverence and resignation we con the dispensations of Divine Provence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of our cities and towns have been visited there is cause for gratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the seat of Government for the discharge of our important duties. But when we reflect that this fatal disorder has within a few years made repeated ravages in some of our principal sea ports and with increased malignancy and when we conser the magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and private business whereby the national interests are deeply affected I think it my duty to invite the Legislature of the Union to examine the expediency of establishing suitable regulations in a of the health laws of the respective States; for these being formed on the ea that contagious sickness may be communicated through the channels of commerce there seems to be a necessity that Congress who alone can regulate trade should frame a system which while it may tend to preserve the general health may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue. While we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferers we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Being our annual oblations of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessings of His provence. To the usual subjects of gratitude I can not omit to add one of the 1st importance to our well being and safety; I mean that spirit which has arisen in our country against the menaces and aggression of a foreign nation. A manly sense of national honor dignity and independence has appeared which if encouraged and invigorated by every branch of the Government will enable us to  undismayed the enterprises of any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory. The course of the transactions in relation to the United States and France which have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made the subject of a future communication. That communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measures which have been taken by the Government of the United States toward an amicable adjustment of differences with that power. You will at the same time perceive that the French Government appears solicitous to impress the opinion that it is averse to a rupture with this country and that it has in a qualified manner declared itself willing to receive a minister from the United States for the purpose of restoring a good understanding. It is unfortunate for professions of this kind that they should be expressed in terms which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualifications which a minister from the United States should possess and that while France is asserting the existence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the differences which have arisen the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the United States of which so many demonstrative proofs have been given should even be indirectly questioned. It is also worthy of observation that the decree of the Directory alleged to be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruisers on our commerce has not given and can not give any relief. It enjoins them to conform to all the laws of France relative to cruising and prizes while these laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have so long so justly and so fruitlessly complained. The law of France enacted in January last which subjects to capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter are of British fabric or produce although the entire property belong to neutrals instead of being rescinded has lately received a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal. While this law which is an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks continues in force those nations can see in the French Government only a power regardless of their essential rights of their independence and sovereignty; and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance. Hitherto therefore nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France which ought to change or relax our measures of defense. On the contrary to extend and invigorate them is our true policy. We have no reason to regret that these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued and in proportion as we enlarge our  of the portentous and incalculable situation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the full development of our energies and resources. But in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the necessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of peace. An efficient preparation for war can alone insure peace. It is peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly cultivated and harmony between us and France may be restored at her option. But to send another minister without more determinate assurances that he would be received would be an act of humiliation to which the United States ought not to submit. It must therefore be left with France (if she is indeed desirous of accommodation) to take the requisite steps. The United States will steadily observe the maxims by which they have hitherto been governed. They will respect the sacred rights of embassy; and with a sincere disposition on the part of France to desist from hostility to make reparation for the injuries heretofore inflicted on our commerce and to do justice in future there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a friendly intercourse. In making to you this declaration I give a pledge to France and the world that the Executive authority of this country still adheres to the humane and pacific policy which has invariably governed its proceedings in conformity with the wishes of the other branches of the Government and of the people of the United States. But consering the late manifestations of her policy toward foreign nations I deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with her or not vigorous preparations for war will be alike indispensable. These alone will give to us an equal treaty and insure its observance. Among the measures of preparation which appear expedient I take the liberty to recall your attention to the al establishment. The beneficial effects of the small al armament proved under the acts of the last session are known and acknowledged. Perhaps no country ever experienced more sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we have derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense. We ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our Navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade. Such a al force as it is doubtless in the power of the United States to create and maintain would also afford to them the best means of general defense by facilitating the safe transportation of troops and stores to every part of our extensive coast. To accomplish this important object a prudent foresight requires that systematic measures be adopted for procuring at all times the requisite timber and other supplies. In what manner this shall be done I leave to your conseration. I will now advert gentlemen to some matters of less moment but proper to be communicated to the National Legislature. After the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the Natchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commences his observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which terminated the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude. From thence he proceeded to run the boundary line between the United States and Spain. was afterwards joined by the Spanish commissioner when the work of the former was confirmed and they proceeded together to the demarcation of the line. Recent information renders it probably that the Southern Indians either instigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of suffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title had not been extinguished have ere this time stopped the progress of the commissioners; and consering the mischiefs which may result from continuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes the great expense attending it and that the boundaries which the commissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as the Indian title has been extinguished it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our commissioner. The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty of amity commerce and igation between the United States and His Britannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace and forming a part of the boundary therein described have finally deced that question. On the 25th of October they made their declaration that a river called Scoodiac which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its northwestern quarter was the true St. Croix intended in the treaty of peace as far as its great fork where one of its streams comes from the westward and the other from the northward and that the latter stream is the continuation of the St. Croix to its source. This decision it is understood will preclude all contention among the inual claimants as it seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch bound the grants of land which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments. A subordinate question however it has been suggested still remains to be determined. Between the mouth of the St. Croix as now settled and what is usually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable islands. The commissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of these islands and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of Fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary but it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty. Such progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of captures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of the 7th article of the treaty of amity commerce and igation between the United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the commissioners will be able to bring their business to a conclusion in August of the ensuing year. The commissioners acting under the 25th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of our citizens for losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war between France and Spain. Various circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law for augmenting the military establishment among these the desire of obtaining the fullest information to direct the best selection of officers. As this object will now be speedily accomplished it is expected that the raising and organizing of the troops will proceed without obstacle and with effect. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:I have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be la before you accompanied with a  of the public receipts and expenditures to a recent period. It will afford you satisfaction to infer the great extent and solity of the public resources from the prosperous state of the finances notwithstanding the unexampled embarrassments which have attended commerce. When you reflect on the conspicuous examples of patriotism and liberality which have been exhibited by our mercantile fellow citizens and how great a proportion of the public resources depends on their enterprise you will naturally conser whether their convenience can not be promoted and reconciled with the security of the revenue by a revision of the system by which the collection is at present regulated. During your recess measures have been steadily pursued for effecting the valuations and returns directed by the act of the last session preliminary to the assessment and collection of a direct tax. No other delays or obstacles have been experienced except such as were expected to arise from the great extent of our country and the magnitude and novelty of the operation and enough has been accomplished to assure a fulfillment of the s of the Legislature. Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:I can not close this address without once more adverting to our political situation and inculcating the essential importance of uniting in the maintenance of our dearest interests; and I trust that by the temper and wisdom of your proceedings and by a harmony of measures we shall secure to our country that weight and respect to which it is so justly entitled. 
 Whereas I have received authentic information that certain lawless and wicked persons of the western frontier in the State of Georgia d lately invade burn and destroy a town belonging to the Cherokee nation although in amity with the United States and put to death several Indians of that nation; and whereas such outrageous conduct not only violates the rights of humanity but also endangers the public peace and it highly becomes the honor and good faith of the United States to pursue all legal means for the punishment of those atrocious offenders; I have therefore thought fit to issue this my proclamation hereby exhorting all the citizens of the United States and requiring all the officers thereof according to their respective stations to use their utmost endeavours to bring those offenders to justice. And I do moreover offer a reward of five hundred dollars for each and every of the abovenamed persons who shall be so apprehended and brought to justice and shall be proved to have assumed or exercised any command or authority among the perpetrators of the crimes aforesa at the time of committing the same. 
 I meet you upon the present occasion with the feelings which are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situation of our common Country and by a persuasion equally strong that the labours of the present45 Session which has just commenced will under the guance of a spirit no less prudent than patriotic issue in measures conducive to the stability and increase of national prosperity.  Numerous as are the Provential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments; the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the husbandman is too important to escape recollection.  Your own observations in your respective situations will have satisfied you of the progressive state of Agriculture Manufactures Commerce and Navigation: In tracing their causes you will have remarked with particular pleasure the happy effects of that revival of confence public as well as private to which the Constitution and Laws of the United States have so eminently contributed: And you will have observed with no less interest new and decisive proofs of the increasing reputation and credit of the Nation. But you nevertheless cannot fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances which will be disclosed in the several official communications that will be made to you in the course of your deliberations.  The rap subscriptions to the Bank of the United States which completed the sum allowed to be subscribed in a single day is among the striking and pleasing evences which present themselves not only of confence in the Government but of resource in the community.  In the interval of your recess due attention has been pa to the execution of the different objects which were specially proved for by the laws and Resolutions of the last Session.  Among the most important of these is the defence and security of the Western Frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish.  Accordingly at the same time that treaties have been provisionally concluded and other proper means used to attach the wavering and to confirm in their friendship the welldisposed tribes of Indians; effectual measures have been adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification was desired upon terms of moderation and justice.  These measures having proved unsuccessful it became necessary to convince the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations. Offensive operations have therefore been directed; to be conducted however as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have been crowned with full success and others are yet depending. The expeditions which have been completed were carried on under the authority and at the expense of the United States by the Militia of Kentucke; whose enterprise intripity and good conduct are entitled to peculiar commendation.  Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded Tribes and conserable numbers of inuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further opposition removed from their former situations and placed themselves under the immediate protection of the United States.  It is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion in future may cease; and that an intimate intercourse may succeed; calculated to advance the happiness of the Indians and to attach them firmly to the United States.  In order to this it seems necessary: That they should experience the benefits of an impartial administration 46 of justice. That the mode of alienating their lands the main source of discontent and war should be so defined and regulated as to obviate imposition and as far as may be practicable controversy concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are made. That commerce with them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment towards them and that such rational experiments should be made for imparting to them the blessings of civilization as may from time to time suit their condition. That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate Interests with the preservation of Peace. And that efficatious provision should be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who by violating their rights shall infringe the Treaties and endanger the peace of the Union.  A System corrisponding with the mild principles of Religion and Philanthropy towards an unenlightened race of Men whose happiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of sound policy.  The powers specially vested in me by the Act laying certain duties on distilled spirits which respect the subisions of the districts into Surveys the appointment of Officers and the assignment of compensations have likewise been carried into effect. In a matter in which both materials and experience were wanting to gue the calculation it will be readily conceived that there must have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed by the law. It is hoped that the circumspection which has been used will be found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects; but it is probable that with a  to the first in some instances a revision of the provision will be found adviseable.  The impressions with which this law has been received by the community have been upon the whole such as were to be expected among enlightened and welldisposed Citizens from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The novelty however of the tax in a conserable part of the United States and a misconception of some of its provisions have given occasion in particular places to some degree of discontent. But it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the law. and I entertain a full confence that it will in all give way to motives which arise out of a just sense of duty and a virtuous regard to the public welfare.  If there are any circumstances in the law which consistently with its main design may be so varied as to remove any well intentioned objections that may happen to exist it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper variations. It is desirable on all occasions to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional and necessary Acts of Government the fullest evence of a disposition as far as may be practicable to consult the wishes of every part of the Community and to lay the foundations of the public administration in the affection 47 of the people.  Pursuant to the authority contained in the several Acts on that subject a district of ten miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the United States has been fixed and announced by proclamation; which district will comprehend lands on both ses of the River Potomack and the towns of Alexandria and George Town. A City has also been la out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congress: And as there is a prospect favoured by the rate of sales which have already taken place of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public buildings there is every expectation of their due progress.  The completion of the Census of the Inhabitants for which provision was made by law has been duly notified (excepting in one instance in which the return has been informal and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried) and the returns of the Officers who were charged with this duty which will be la before you will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population of the United States borders on four Millions of persons.  It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of two millions and a half of Florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are similar to those of the one last announced except as to a small reduction of charges. Another on like terms for six Millions of Florins had been set on foot under circumstances that assured immediate completion.  Gentlemen of the Senate:  Two treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and Six Nations of Indians will be la before you for your conseration and ratification.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:  In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust you must anticipate with pleasure that many of the difficulties necessarily incent to the first arrangements of a new Government for an extensive Country have been happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predecessors in cooperation with the other branch of the legislature. The important objects which remain to be accomplished will I am persuaded be conducted upon principles equally comprehensive and equally well calculated for the advancement of the general weal.  The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States having expired statements from the proper department will as soon as possible apprize you of the exact result. Enough however is already known to afford an assurance that the s of that Act have been substantially fulfilled. The subscription in the domestic debt of the United States has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that debt; affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public Creditors with the System which has been proposed to their acceptance and of the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which they are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States as far as the provisions of the law have permitted may be sa to be yet more general. The part of the debt of the United States which remains unsubscribed will naturally engage your further deliberations.  It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you that the revenues which have been established promise to be adequate to their objects; and may be permitted if no unforeseen exigency occurs to supercede for the present the necessity of any new burthens upon our Constituents.  An Object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the current service of the ensuing year together with such ascertained demands upon the Treasury as require to be immediately discharged; and such casualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public business for which no specific appropriations may have yet been made; of all which a proper estimate will be la before you.  Gentlement of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:  I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for several objects upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed any definite resolution. Their importance will recall them to your attention; and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements of the Government will afford you leisure to resume them with advantage.  There are however some of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular mention. These are the Militia; the PostOffice and Postroads; the Mint; Weights and Measures; a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States.  The first is certainly an object of primary importance whether ed in reference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community or to the preservation of order. In connection with this the establishment of competent Magazines and Arsenals and the fortification of such places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally present themselves to conseration. The safety of the United States under Divine protection ought to rest on the basis of systematic and sol arrangements; exposed as little as possible to the hazard of fortuitous circumstances.  The importance of the PostOffice and PostRoads on a plan sufficiently liberal and comprehensive as they respect the expedition safety and facility of communication is increased by the instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the government; which while it contributes to the security of the people serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation and misconception. The establishment of additional crossposts especially to some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union cannot fail to be of material Utility.  The disorders in the existing currency and especially the scarcity of small change a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer es strongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered into concerning the establishment of a Mint. Measures have been taken pursuant to that Resolution for procuring some of the most necessary Artists together with the requisite Apparatus.  An uniformity in the weights and measures of the Country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal must be no less honorable to the public Councils than conducive to the public convenience.  A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly urged among other reasons by the important conserations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the principal but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the public of its right.
