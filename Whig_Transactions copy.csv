To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:< If any people ever had cause to render up thanks to the Supreme Being for parental care and protection extended to them in all the trials and difficulties to which they have been from time to time exposed we certainly are that people. From the first settlement of our forefathers on this continent through the dangers attendant upon the occupation of a savage wilderness through a long period of colonial dependence through the War of the Revolution in the wisdom which led to the adoption of the existing forms of republican government in the hazards incent to a war subsequently waged with one of the most powerful nations of the earth in the increase of our population in the spread of the arts and sciences and in the strength and durability conferred on political institutions emanating from the people and sustained by their will the superintendence of an overruling Provence has been plainly visible. As preparatory therefore to entering once more upon the high duties of legislation it becomes us humbly to acknowledge our dependence upon Him as our gue and protector and to implore a continuance of His parental watchfulness over our beloved country. We have new cause for the expression of our gratitude in the preservation of the health of our fellowcitizens with some partial and local exceptions during the past season for the abundance with which the earth has yielded up its fruits to the labors of the husbandman for the renewed activity which has been imparted to commerce for the revival of trade in all its departments for the increased rewards attendant on the exercise of the mechanic arts for the continued growth of our population and the raply reviving prosperity of the whole country. I shall be permitted to exchange congratulations with you gentlemen of the two Houses of Congress on these auspicious circumstances and to assure you in advance of my ready disposition to cur with you in the adoption of all such measures as shall be calculated to increase the happiness of our constituents and to advance the glory of our common country.< Since the last adjournment of Congress the Executive has relaxed no effort to render indestructible the relations of amity which so happily exist between the United States and other countries. The treaty lately concluded with Great Britain has tended greatly to increase the good understanding which a reciprocity of interests is calculated to encourage and it is most ardently to be hoped that nothing may transpire to interrupt the relations of amity which it is so obviously the policy of both nations to cultivate. A question of much importance still remains to be adjusted between them. The territorial limits of the two countries relation to what is commonly known as the Oregon Territory still remain in dispute. The United States would be at all times indisposed to aggrandize itself at the expense of any other nation; but while they would be restrained by principles of honor which should govern the conduct of nations as well as that of inuals from setting up a demand for territory which does not belong to them they would as unwillingly sent to a surrender of their rights. After the most rig and as far as practicable unbiased examination of the subject the United States have always contended that their rights appertain to the entire region of country lying on the Pacific and embraced within 42° and 54° 40' of north latitude. This claim being controverted by Great Britain those who have preceded the present Executiveactuated no doubt by an earnest desire to adjust the matter upon terms mutually satisfactory to both countrieshave caused to be submitted to the British Government propositions for settlement and final adjustment which however have not proved heretofore acceptable to it. Our minister at London has under instructions again brought the subject to the conseration of that Government and while nothing will be done to compromise the rights or honor of the United States every proper expedient will be resorted to in order to bring the negotiation now in the progress of resumption to a speedy and happy termination. In the meantime it is proper to remark that many of our citizens are either already established in the Territory or are on their way thither for the purpose of forming permanent settlements while others are preparing to follow; and in  of these facts I must repeat the recommendation contained in previous messages for the establishment of military posts at such places on the line of travel as will furnish security and protection to our hardy adventurers against hostile tribes of Indians inhabiting those extensive regions. Our laws should also follow them so modified as the circumstances of the case may seem to require. Under the influence of our free system of government new republics are destined to spring up at no distant day on the shores of the Pacific similar in policy and in feeling to those existing on this se of the Rocky Mountains and giving a wer and more extensive spread to the principles of civil and religious liberty.< I am happy to inform you that the cases which have from time to time arisen of the detention of American vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Africa under pretense of being engaged in the slave trade have been placed in a fair train of adjustment. In the case of the William and Francis full satisfaction will be allowed. In the cases of the Tygris and Seamew the British Government admits that satisfaction is due. In the case of the Jones the sum accruing from the sale of that vessel and cargo will be pa to the owners while I can not but flatter myself that full indemnification will be allowed for all damages sustained by the detention of the vessel; and in the case of the Douglas Her Majesty's Government has expressed its determination to make indemnification. Strong hopes are therefore entertained that most if not all of these cases will be speedily adjusted. No new cases have arisen since the ratification of the treaty of Washington and it is confently anticipated that the slave trade under the operation of the eighth article of that treaty will be altogether suppressed.< The occasional interruption experienced by our fellowcitizens engaged in the fisheries on the neighboring coast of Nova Scotia has not failed to claim the attention of the Executive. Representations upon this subject have been made but as yet no definitive answer to those representations has been received from the British Government.< Two other subjects of comparatively minor importance but nevertheless of too much consequence to be neglected remain still to be adjusted between the two countries. By the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of July 1815 it is proved that no higher duties shall be levied in either country on articles imported from the other than on the same articles imported from any other place. In 1836 rough rice by act of Parliament was admitted from the coast of Africa into Great Britain on the payment of a duty of 1 penny a quarter while the same article from all other countries including the United States was subjected to the payment of a duty of 20 shillings a quarter. Our minister at London has from time to time brought this subject to the attention of the British Government but so far without success. is instructed to renew his representations upon it.< Some years since a claim was preferred against the British Government on the part of certain American merchants for the return of export duties pa by them on shipments of woolen goods to the United States after the duty on similar articles exported to other countries had been repealed and consequently in contravention of the commercial convention between the two nations securing to us equality in such cases. The principle on which the claim rests has long since been virtually admitted by Great Britain but obstacles to a settlement have from time to time been interposed so that a large portion of the amount claimed has not yet been refunded. Our minister is now engaged in the prosecution of the claim and I can not but persuade myself that the British Government will no longer delay its adjustment.< I am happy to be able to say that nothing has occurred to disturb in any degree the relations of amity which exist between the United States and France Austria and Russia as well as with the other powers of Europe since the adjournment of Congress. Spain has been agitated with internal convulsions for many years from the effects of which it is hoped she is destined speedily to recover when under a more liberal system of commercial policy on her part our trade with her may again fill its old and so far as her continental possessions are concerned its almost forsaken channels thereby adding to the mutual prosperity of the two countries.< The Germanic Association of Customs and Commerce which since its establishment in 1833 has been steadily growing in power and importance and consists at this time of more than twenty German States and embraces a population of 27000000 people united for all fire purposes of commercial intercourse with each other and with foreign states offers to the latter the most valuable exchanges on principles more liberal than are offered in the fiscal system of any other European power. From its origin the importance of the German union has never been lost sight of by the United States. The industry morality and other valuable qualities of the German nation have always been well known and appreciated. On this subject I invite the attention of Congress to the report of the Secretary of State from which it will be seen that while our cotton is admitted free of duty and the duty on rice has been much reduced (which has already led to a greatly increased consumption) a strong disposition has been recently evinced by that great body to reduce upon certain conditions their present duty upon tobacco. This being the first intimation of a concession on this interesting subject ever made by any European power I can not but regard it as well calculated to remove the only impediment which has so far existed to the most liberal commercial intercourse between us and them. In this  our minister at Berlin who has heretofore industriously pursued the subject has been instructed to enter upon the negotiation of a commercial treaty which while it will open new advantages to the agricultural interests of the United States and a more free and expanded field for commercial operations will affect injuriously no existing interest of the Union. Should the negotiation be crowned with success its results will be communicated to both Houses of Congress.< I communicate herewith certain dispatches received from our minister at Mexico and also a correspondence which has recently occurred between the envoy from that Republic and the Secretary of State. It must but be regarded as not a little extraordinary that the Government of Mexico in anticipation of a public discussion (which it has been pleased to infer from newspaper publications as likely to take place in Congress relating to the annexation of Texas to the United States) should have so far anticipated the result of such discussion as to have announced its determination to visit any such anticipated decision by a formal declaration of war against the United States. If designed to prevent Congress from introducing that question as a fit subject for its calm deliberation and final judgment the Executive has no reason to doubt that it will entirely fail of its object. The representatives of a brave and patriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequences to embarrass them in the course of their proposed deliberations nor will the executive department of the Government fail for any such cause to discharge its whole duty to the country.< The war which has existed for so long a time between Mexico and Texas has since the battle of San Jacinto consisted for the most part of predatory incursions which while they have been attended with much of suffering to inuals and have kept the borders of the two countries in a state of constant alarm have failed to approach to any definitive result. Mexico has fitted out no formable armament by land or by sea for the subjugation of Texas. Eight years have now elapsed since Texas declared her independence of Mexico and during that time she has been recognized as a sovereign power by several of the principal civilized states. Mexico nevertheless perseveres in her plans of reconquest and refuses to recognize her independence. The predatory incursions to which I have alluded have been attended in one instance with the breaking up of the courts of justice by the seizing upon the persons of the judges jury and officers of the court and dragging them along with unarmed and therefore noncombatant citizens into a cruel and oppressive bondage thus leaving crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass unreproved. A border warfare is evermore to be deprecated and over such a war as has existed for so many years between these two States humanity has had great cause to lament. Nor is such a condition of things to be deplored only because of the inual suffering attendant upon it. The effects are far more extensive. The Creator of the Universe has given man the earth for his resting place and its fruits for his subsistence. Whatever therefore shall make the first or any part of it a scene of desolation affects injuriously his heritage and may be regarded as a general calamity. Wars may sometimes be necessary but all nations have a common interest in bringing them speedily to a close. The United States have an immediate interest in seeing an end put to the state of hostilities existing between Mexico and Texas. They are our neighbors of the same continent with whom we are not only desirous of cultivating the relations of amity but of the most extended commercial intercourse and to practice all the rites of a neighborhood hospitality. Our own interests are involved in the matter since however neutral may be our course of policy we can not hope to escape the effects of a spirit of jealousy on the part of both of the powers. Nor can this Government be indifferent to the fact that a warfare such as is waged between those two nations is calculated to weaken both powers and finally to render themand especially the weaker of the twothe subjects of interference on the part of stronger and more powerful nations who intent only on advancing their own peculiar s may sooner or later attempt to bring about a compliance with terms as the condition of their interposition alike derogatory to the nation granting them and detrimental to the interests of the United States. We could not be expected quietly to permit any such interference to our disadvantage. Consering that Texas is separated from the United States by a mere geographical line; that her territory in the opinion of many down to a late period formed a portion of the territory of the United States; that it is homogeneous in its population and pursuits with adjoining States makes contributions to the commerce of the world in the same articles with them and that most of her inhabitants have been citizens of the United States speak the same language and live under similar political institutions with ourselves this Government is bound by every conseration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that she shall be left free to act especially in regard to her domestic affairs unawed by force and unrestrained by the policy or s of other countries. In full  of all these conserations the Executive has not hesitated to express to the Government of Mexico how deeply it deprecated a continuance of the war and how anxiously it desired to witness its termination. I can not but think that it becomes the United States as the oldest of the American Republics to hold a language to Mexico upon this subject of an unambiguous character. It is time that this war had ceased. There must be a limit to all wars and if the parent state after an eight years' struggle has failed to reduce to submission a portion of its subjects standing out in revolt against it and who have not only proclaimed themselves to be independent but have been recognized as such by other powers she ought not to expect that other nations will quietly look on to their obvious injury upon a protraction of hostilities. These United States threw off their colonial dependence and established independent governments and Great Britain after having wasted her energies in the attempt to subdue them for a less period than Mexico has attempted to subjugate Texas had the wisdom and justice to acknowledge their independence thereby recognizing the obligation which rested on her as one of the family of nations. An example thus set by one of the proudest as well as most powerful nations of the earth it could in no way disparage Mexico to imitate. While therefore the Executive would deplore any collision with Mexico or any disturbance of the friendly relations which exist between the two countries it can not permit that Government to control its policy whatever it may be toward Texas but will treat heras by the recognition of her independence the United States have long since declared they would doas entirely independent of Mexico. The high obligations of public duty may enforce from the constituted authorities of the United States a policy which the course persevered in by Mexico will have mainly contributed to produce and the Executive in such a touting they will with confence throw itself upon the patriotism of the people to sustain the Government in its course of action.< Measures of an unusual character have recently been adopted by the Mexican Government calculated in no small degree to affect the trade of other nations with Mexico and to operate injuriously to the United States. All foreigners by a decree of the 23d day of September and after six months from the day of its promulgation are forbden to carry on the business of selling by retail any goods within the confines of Mexico. Against this decree our minister has not failed to remonstrate.< The trade heretofore carried on by our citizens with Santa Fe in which much capital was already invested and which was becoming of daily increasing importance has suddenly been arrested by a decree of virtual prohibition on the part of the Mexican Government. Whatever may be the right of Mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the citizens or subjects of foreign powers this late procedure to say the least of it wears a harsh and unfriendly aspect.< The installments on the claims recently settled by the convention with Mexico have been punctually pa as they have fallen due and our minister is engaged in urging the establishment of a new commission in pursuance of the convention for the settlement of unadjusted claims.< With the other American States our relations of amity and good will have remained uninterrupted. Our minister near the Republic of New Granada has succeeded in effecting an adjustment of the claim upon that Government for the schooner By Chance which had been pending for many years. The claim for the brig Morris which had its origin during the existence of the Republic of Colombia and indemnification for which since the dissolution of that Republic has devolved upon its several members will be urged with renewed zeal.< I have much pleasure in saying that the Government of Brazil has adjusted the claim upon that Government in the case of the schooner John S. Bryan and that sanguine hopes are entertained that the same spirit of justice will influence its councils in arriving at an early decision upon the remaining claims thereby removing all cause of dissension between two powers whose interests are to some extent interwoven with each other.< Our minister at Chili has succeeded in inducing a recognition by that Government of the adjustment effected by his predecessor of the first claim in the case of the Macedonian. The first installment has been received by the claimants in the United States.< Notice of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty with Peru which will take place at Lima has not yet reached this country but is shortly expected to be received when the claims upon that Republic will doubtless be liquated and pa.< In consequence of a misunderstanding between this Government and that of Buenos Ayres occurring several years ago this Government has remained unrepresented at that Court while a minister from it has been constantly resent here. The causes of irritation have in a great measure passed away and it is in contemplation in  of important interests which have grown up in that country at some early period during the present session of Congress with the concurrence of the Senate to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.< Under the provisions of an act of Congress of the last session a minister was dispatched from the United States to China in August of the present year who from the latest accounts we have from him was at Suez in Egypt on the 25th of September last on his route to China.< In regard to the Indian tribes resing within our jurisdictional limits the greatest vigilance of the Government has been exerted to preserve them at peace among themselves and to inspire them with feelings of confence in the justice of this Government and to cultivate friendship with the border inhabitants. This has happily succeeded to a great extent but it is a subject of regret that they suffer themselves in some instances to be imposed upon by artful and designing men and this notwithstanding all efforts of the Government to prevent it.< The receipts into the Treasury for the calendar year 1843 exclusive of loans were little more than $ 18000000 and the expenditures exclusive of the payments on the public debt will have been about $23000000. By the act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year was made so that it should commence on the 1st day of July in each year. The accounts and estimates for the current fiscal year will show that the loans and Treasury notes made and issued before the close of the last Congress to meet the anticipated deficiency have not been entirely adequate. Although on the 1st of October last there was a balance in the Treasury in consequence of the provisions thus made of $3914082.77 yet the appropriations already made by Congress will absorb that balance and leave a probable deficiency of $2000000 at the close of the present fiscal year. There are outstanding Treasury notes to about the amount of $4600000 and should they be returned upon the Treasury during the fiscal year they will require provision for their redemption. I do not however regard this as probable since they have obviously entered into the currency of the country and will continue to form a portion of it if the system now adopted be continued. The loan of 1841 amounting to $5672976.88 falls due on the 1st day of January 1845 and must be proved for or postponed by a new loan; and unless the resources of revenue should be materially increased by you there will be a probable deficiency for the service of the fiscal year ending June 30 1845 of upward of $4000000.< The delusion incent to an enormously excessive paper circulation which gave a fictitious value to everything and stimulated adventure and speculation to an extravagant extent has been happily succeeded by the substitution of the precious metals and paper promptly redeemable in specie; and thus false values have disappeared and a sounder condition of things has been introduced. This transition although intimately connected with the prosperity of the country has nevertheless been attended with much embarrassment to the Government in its financial concerns. So long as the foreign importers could receive payment for their cargoes in a currency of greatly less value than that in Europe but fully available here in the purchase of our agricultural productions (their profits being immeasurably augmented by the operation) the shipments were large and the revenues of the Government became superabundant. But the change in the character of the circulation from a nominal and apparently real value in the first stage of its existence to an obviously depreciated value in its second so that it no longer answered the purposes of exchange or barter and its ultimate substitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combined has been attended by diminished importations and a consequent falling off in the revenue. This has induced Congress from 1837 to resort to the expedient of issuing Treasury notes and finally of funding them in order to supply deficiencies. I can not however withhold the remark that it is in no way compatible with the dignity of the Government that a public debt should be created in time of peace to meet the current expenses of the Government or that temporary expedients should be resorted to an hour longer than it is possible to avo them. The Executive can do no more than apply the means which Congress places in its hands for the support of Government and happily for the good of the country and for the preservation of its liberties it possesses no power to levy exactions on the people or to force from them contributions to the public revenue in any form. It can only recommend such measures as may in its opinion be called for by the wants of the public service to Congress with whom alone rests the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises. This duty has upon several occasions heretofore been performed. The present condition of things gives flattering promise that trade and commerce are raply reviving and fortunately for the country the sources of revenue have only to be opened in order to prove abundant.< While we can anticipate no conserable increase in the proceeds of the sales of the public lands for reasons perfectly obvious to all for several years to come yet the public lands can not otherwise than be regarded as the foundation of the public credit. With so large a body of the most fertile lands in the world under the control and at the disposal of this Government no one can reasonably doubt the entire ability to meet its engagements under every emergency. In seasons of trial and difficulty similar to those through which we are passing the capitalist makes his investments in the Government cut stocks with the most assured confence of ultimate reimbursement; and whatever may be sa of a period of great financial prosperity such as existed for some years after 1833 I should regard it as suical in a season of financial embarrassment either to alienate the lands themselves or the proceeds arising from their sales. The first and paramount duty of those to whom may be intrusted the administration of public affairs is to guard the public credit. In reestablishing the credit of this central Government the readiest and most obvious mode is taken to restore the credit of the States. The extremities can only be made sound by producing a healthy action in the central Government and the history of the present day fully establishes the fact that an increase in the value of the stocks of this Government will in a great majority of instances be attended by an increase in the value of the stocks of the States. It should therefore be a matter of general congratulation that amst all the embarrassments arising from surrounding circumstances the credit of the Government should have been so fully restored that it has been enabled to effect a loan of $7000000 to redeem that amount of Treasury notes on terms more favorable than any that have been offered for many years. And the 6 per cent stock which was created in 1842 has advanced in the hands of the holders nearly 20 per cent above its par value. The confence of the people in the integrity of their Government has thus been signally manifested. These opinions relative to the public lands do not in any manner conflict with the observance of the most liberal policy toward those of our fellowcitizens who press forward into the wilderness and are the pioneers in the work of its reclamation. In securing to all such their rights of preemption the Government performs but an act of retributive justice for sufferings encountered and hardships endured and finds ample remuneration in the comforts which its policy insures and the happiness which it imparts.< Should a revision of the tariff with a  to revenue become necessary in the estimation of Congress I doubt not you will approach the subject with a just and enlightened regard to the interests of the whole Union. The principles and s which I have heretofore had occasion to submit remain unchanged. It can however never be too often repeated that the prominent interest of every important pursuit of life requires for success permanency and stability in legislation. These can only be attained by adopting as the basis of action moderation in all things which is as indispensably necessary to secure the harmonious action of the political as of the animal system. In our political organization no one section of the country should desire to have its supposed interests advanced at the sacrifice of all others but union being the great interest equally precious to all should be fostered and sustained by mutual concessions and the cultivation of that spirit of compromise from which the Constitution itself proceeded.< You will be informed by the report from the Treasury Department of the measures taken under the act of the last session authorizing the reissue of Treasury notes in lieu of those then outstanding. The system adopted in pursuance of existing laws seems well calculated to save the country a large amount of interest while it affords conveniences and obviates dangers and expense in the transmission of funds to disbursing agents. I refer you also to that report for the means proposed by the Secretary to increase the revenue and particularly to that portion of it which relates to the subject of the warehousing system which I earnestly urged upon Congress at its last session and as to the importance of which my opinion has undergone no change.< In  of the disordered condition of the currency at the time and the high rates of exchange between different parts of the country I felt it to be incumbent on me to present to the conseration of your predecessors a proposition conflicting in no degree with the Constitution or with the rights of the States and having the sanction (not in detail but in principle) of some of the eminent men who have preceded me in the Executive office. That proposition cond the issuing of Treasury notes of denominations of not less than $5 nor more than $100 to be employed in the payment of the obligations of the Government in lieu of gold and silver at the option of the public creditor and to an amount not exceeding $15000000. It was proposed to make them receivable everywhere and to establish at various points depositories of gold and silver to be held in trust for the redemption of such notes so as to insure their convertibility into specie. No doubt was entertained that such notes would have maintained a par value with gold and silver thus furnishing a paper currency of equal value over the Union thereby meeting the just expectations of the people and fulfilling the duties of a parental government. Whether the depositories should be permitted to sell or purchase bills under very limited restrictions together with all its other details was submitted to the wisdom of Congress and was regarded as of secondary importance. I thought then and think now that such an arrangement would have been attended with the happiest results. The whole matter of the currency would have been placed where by the Constitution it was designed to be placedunder the immediate supervision and control of Congress. The action of the Government would have been independent of all corporations and the same eye which rests unceasingly on the specie currency and guards it against adulteration would also have rested on the paper currency to control and regulate its issues and protect it against depreciation. The same reasons which would forb Congress from parting with the power over the coinage would seem to operate with nearly equal force hi regard to any substitution for the precious metals in the form of a circulating medium. Paper when substituted for specie constitutes a standard of value by which the operations of society are regulated and whatsoever causes its depreciation affects society to an extent nearly if not quite equal to the adulteration of the coin. Nor can I 
ithhold the remark that its advantages contrasted with a bank of the United States apart from the fact that a bank was esteemed as obnoxious to the public sentiment as well on the score of expediency as of constitutionality appeared to me to be striking and obvious. The relief which a bank would afford by an issue of $15000000 of its notes judging from the experience of the late United States Bank would not have occurred in less than fifteen years whereas under the proposed arrangement the relief arising from the issue of $15000000 of Treasury notes would have been consummated in one year thus furnishing in onefifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have accomplished it a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real wants of the country at par value with gold and silver. The saving to the Government would have been equal to all the interest which it has had to pay on Treasury notes of previous as well as subsequent issues thereby relieving the Government and at the same time affording relief to the people. Under all the responsibilities attached to the station which I occupy and in redemption of a pledge given to the last Congress at the close of its first session I submitted the suggestion to its conseration at two consecutive sessions. The recommendation however met with no favor at its hands. While I am free to admit that the necessities of the times have since become greatly ameliorated and that there is good reason to hope that the country is safely and raply emerging from the difficulties and embarrassments which everywhere surrounded it in 1841 yet I can not but think that its restoration to a sound and healthy condition would be greatly expedited by a resort to the expedient in a modified form.< The operations of the Treasury now rest upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 and those laws have been so administered as to produce as great a quantum of good to the country as their provisions are capable of yielding. If there had been any distinct expression of opinion going to show that public sentiment is averse to the plan either as heretofore recommended to Congress or in a modified form while my own opinion in regard to it would remain unchanged I should be very far from again presenting it to your conseration. The Government has originated with the States and the people for their own benefit and advantage and it would be subversive of the foundation principles of the political edifice which they have reared to persevere in a measure which in their mature judgments they had either repudiated or condemned. The will of our constituents clearly expressed should be regarded as the light to gue our footsteps the true difference between a monarchical or aristocratical government and a republic being that in the first the will of the few prevails over the will of the many while in the last the will of the many should be alone consulted.< The report of the Secretary of War will bring you acquainted with the condition of that important branch of the public service. The Army may be regarded in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in each company and regiment as little more than a nucleus around which to rally the military force of the country in case of war and yet its services in preserving the peace of the frontiers are of a most important nature. In all cases of emergency the reliance of the country is properly placed in the militia of the several States and it may well deserve the conseration of Congress whether a new and more perfect organization might not be introduced looking mainly to the volunteer companies of the Union for the present and of easy application to the great body of the militia in time of war.< The expenditures of the War Department have been conserably reduced in the last two years. Contingencies however may arise which would call for the filling up of the regiments with a full complement of men and make it very desirable to remount the corps of dragoons which by an act of the last Congress was directed to be dissolved.< I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary for information in relation to the Navy of the United States. While every effort has been and will continue to be made to retrench all superfluities and lop off all excrescences which from time to time may have grown up yet it has not been regarded as wise or prudent to recommend any material change in the annual appropriations. The interests which are involved are of too important a character to lead to the recommendation of any other than a liberal policy. Adequate appropriations ought to be made to enable the Executive to fit out all the ships that are now in a course of building or that require repairs for active service in the shortest possible time should any emergency arise which may require it. An efficient y while it is the cheapest means of public defense enlists in its support the feelings of pre and confence which brilliant deeds and heroic valor have heretofore served to strengthen and confirm.< I refer you particularly to that part of the Secretary's report which has reference to recent experiments in the application of steam and in the construction of our war steamers made under the superintendence of distinguished officers of the Navy. In addition to other manifest improvements in the construction of the steam engine and application of the motive power which has rendered them more appropriate to the uses of ships of war one of those officers has brought into use a power which makes the steamship most formable either for attack or defense. I can not too strongly recommend this subject to your conseration and do not hesitate to express my entire conviction of its great importance.< I call your particular attention also to that portion of the Secretary's report which has reference to the act of the late session of Congress which prohibited the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other heads of appropriation to that for building equipment and repair. The repeal of that prohibition will enable the Department to give renewed employment to a large  of workmen who have been necessarily discharged in consequence of the want of means to pay thema circumstance attended especially at this season of the year with much privation and suffering.< It gives me great pain to announce to you the loss of the steamship the Missouri by fire in the Bay of Gibraltar where she had stopped to renew her supplies of coal on her voyage to Alexandria with Mr. Cushing the American minister to China on board. There is ground for high commendation of the officers and men for the coolness and intrepity and perfect submission to discipline evinced under the most trying circumstances. Surrounded by a raging fire which the utmost exertions could not subdue and which threatened momentarily the explosion of her wellsupplied magazines the officers exhibited no signs of fear and the men obeyed every order with alacrity. Nor was she abandoned until the last gleam of hope of saving her had expired. It is well worthy of your conseration whether the losses sustained by the officers and crew in this unfortunate affair should not be reimbursed to them.< I can not take leave of this painful subject without adverting to the a rendered upon the occasion by the British authorities at Gibraltar and the commander officers and crew of the British ship of the line the Malabar which was lying at the time in the bay. Everything that generosity or humanity could dictate was promptly performed. It is by such acts of good will by one to another of the family of nations that fraternal feelings are nourished and the blessings of permanent peace secured.< The report of the PostmasterGeneral will bring you acquainted with the operations of that Department during the past year and will suggest to you such modifications of the existing laws as in your opinion the exigencies of the public service may require. The change which the country has undergone of late years in the mode of travel and transportation has afforded so many facilities for the transmission of mail matter out of the regular mail as to require the greatest vigilance and circumspection in order to enable the officer at the head of the Department to restrain the expenditures within the income. There is also too much reason to fear that the franking privilege has run into great abuse. The Department nevertheless has been conducted with the greatest vigor and has attained at the least possible expense all the useful objects for which it was established.< In regard to all the Departments I am quite happy in the belief that nothing has been left undone which was called for by a true spirit of economy or by a system of accountability rigly enforced. This is in some degree apparent from the fact that the Government has sustained no loss by the default of any of its agents. In the complex but at the same time beautiful machinery of our system of government it is not a matter of surprise that some remote agency may have failed for an instant to fulfill its desired office; but I feel confent in the assertion that nothing has occurred to interrupt the harmonious action of the Government itself and that while the laws have been executed with efficiency and vigor the rights neither of States nor inuals have been trampled on or disregarded.< In the meantime the country has been steadily advancing in all that contributes to national greatness. The te of population continues unbrokenly to flow into the new States and Territories where a refuge is found not only for our nativeborn fellowcitizens but for emigrants from all parts of the civilized world who come among us to partake of the blessings of our free institutions and to a by their labor to swell the current of our wealth and power.< It is due to every conseration of public policy that the lakes and rivers of the West should receive all such attention at the hands of Congress as the Constitution will enable it to bestow. Works in favorable and proper situations on the Lakes would be found to be as indispensably necessary in case of war to carry on safe and successful al operations as fortifications on the Atlantic seaboard. The appropriation made by the last Congress for the improvement of the igation of the Mississippi River has been diligently and efficiently applied.< I can not close this communication gentlemen without recommending to your most favorable conseration the interests of this District. Appointed by the Constitution its exclusive legislators and forming in this particular the only anomaly in our system of governmentof the legislative body being elected by others than those for whose advantage they are to legislateyou will feel a superadded obligation to look well into their condition and to leave no cause for complaint or regret. The seat of Government of our associated republics can not but be regarded as worthy of your parental care.< In connection with its other interests as well as those of the whole country I recommend that at your present session you adopt such measures in order to carry into effect the Smithsonian bequest as in your judgment will be best calculated to consummate the liberal intent of the testator.< When under a dispensation of Divine Provence I succeeded to the presential office the state of public affairs was embarrassing and critical. To add to the irritation consequent upon a longstanding controversy with one of the most powerful nations of modern times involving not only questions of boundary (which under the most favorable circumstances are always embarrassing) but at the same time important and high principles of maritime law border controversies between the citizens and subjects of the two countries had engendered a state of feeling and of conduct which threatened the most calamitous consequences. The hazards incent to this state of things were greatly heightened by the arrest and imprisonment of a subject of Great Britain who acting (as it was alleged) as a part of a military force had aed in the commission of an act violative of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and involving the murder of a citizen of the State of New York. A large amount of claims against the Government of Mexico remained unadjusted and a war of several years' continuance with the savage tribes of Flora still prevailed attended with the desolation of a large portion of that beautiful Territory and with the sacrifice of many valuable lives. To increase the embarrassments of the Government inual and State credit had been nearly stricken down and confence in the General Government was so much impaired thatloans of a small amount could only be negotiated at a conserable sacrifice. As a necessary consequence of the blight which had fallen on commerce and mechanical industry the ships of the one were thrown out of employment and the operations of the other had been greatly diminished. Owing to the condition of the currency exchanges between different parts of the country had become ruinously high and trade had to depend on a depreciated paper currency in conducting its transactions. I shall be permitted to congratulate the country that under an overruling Provence peace was preserved without a sacrifice of the national honor; the war in Flora was brought to a speedy termination; a large portion of the claims on Mexico have been fully adjudicated and are in a course of payment while justice has been rendered to us in other matters by other nations; confence between man and man is in a great measure restored and the credit of this Government fully and perfectly reestablished; commerce is becoming more and more extended in its operations and manufacturing and mechanical industry once more reap the rewards of skill and labor honestly applied; the operations of trade rest on a sound currency and the rates of exchange are reduced to their lowest amount.< In this condition of things I have felt it to be my duty to bring to your favorable conseration matters of great interest in their present and ultimate results; and the only desire which I feel in connection with the future is and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and its institutions unimpaired.< 
FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:< I congratulate you and our common constituency upon the favorable auspices under which you meet for your first session. Our country is at peace with all the world. The agitation which for a time threatened to disturb the fraternal relations which make us one people is fast subsing and a year of general prosperity and health has crowned the nation with unusual blessings. None can look back to the dangers which are passed or forward to the bright prospect before us without feeling a thrill of gratification at the same time that he must be impressed with a grateful sense of our profound obligations to a beneficent Provence whose paternal care is so manifest in the happiness of this highly favored land.< Since the close of the last Congress certain Cubans and other foreigners resent in the United States who were more or less concerned in the previous invasion of Cuba instead of being discouraged by its failure have again abused the hospitality of this country by making it the scene of the equipment of another military expedition against that possession of Her Catholic Majesty in which they were countenanced aed and joined by citizens of the United States. On receiving intelligence that such designs were entertained I lost no time in issuing such instructions to the proper officers of the United States as seemed to be called for by the occasion. By the proclamation a copy of which is herewith submitted I also warned those who might be in danger of being inveigled into this scheme of its unlawful character and of the penalties which they would incur. For some time there was reason to hope that these measures had sufficed to prevent any such attempt. This hope however proved to be delusive. Very early in the morning of the 3d of August a steamer called the Pampero departed from New Orleans for Cuba having on board upward of 400 armed men with event intentions to make war upon the authorities of the island. This expedition was set on foot in palpable violation of the laws of the United States. Its leader was a Spaniard and several of the chief officers and some others engaged in it were foreigners. The persons composing it however were mostly citizens of the United States.< Before the expedition set out and probably before it was organized a slight insurrectionary movement which appears to have been soon suppressed had taken place in the eastern quarter of Cuba. The importance of this movement was unfortunately so much exaggerated in the accounts of it published in this country that these adventurers seem to have been led to believe that the Creole population of the island not only desired to throw off the authority of the mother country but had resolved upon that step and had begun a wellconcerted enterprise for effecting it. The persons engaged in the expedition were generally young and ill informed. The steamer in which they embarked left New Orleans stealthily and without a clearance. After touching at Key West she proceeded to the coast of Cuba and on the night between the 11th and 12th of August landed the persons on board at Playtas within about 20 leagues of Havana.< The main body of them proceeded to and took possession of an inland village 6 leagues distant leaving others to follow in charge of the baggage as soon as the means of transportation could be obtained. The latter having taken up their line of march to connect themselves with the main body and having proceeded about 4 leagues into the country were attacked on the morning of the 13th by a body of Spanish troops and a bloody conflict ensued after which they retreated to the place of disembarkation where about 50 of them obtained boats and reembarked therein. They were however intercepted among the keys near the shore by a Spanish steamer cruising on the coast captured and carried to Havana and after being examined before a military court were sentenced to be publicly executed and the sentence was carried into effect on the 16th of August.< On receiving information of what had occurred Commodore Foxhall A. Parker was instructed to proceed in the steam frigate Saranac to Havana and inquire into the charges against the persons executed the circumstances under which they were taken and whatsoever referred to their trial and sentence. Copies of the instructions from the Department of State to him and of his letters to that Department are herewith submitted.< According to the record of the examination the prisoners all admitted the offenses charged against them of being hostile invaders of the island. At the time of their trial and execution the main body of the invaders was still in the field making war upon the Spanish authorities and Spanish subjects. After the lapse of some days being overcome by the Spanish troops they dispersed on the 24th of August. Lopez their leader was captured some days after and executed on the 1st of September. Many of his remaining followers were killed or died of hunger and fatigue and the rest were made prisoners. Of these none appear to have been tried or executed. Several of them were pardoned upon application of their friends and others and the rest about 160 in number were sent to Spain. Of the final disposition made of these we have no official information.< Such is the melancholy result of this illegal and illfated expedition. Thus thoughtless young men have been induced by false and fraudulent representations to violate the law of their country through rash and unfounded expectations of assisting to accomplish political revolutions in other states and have lost their lives in the undertaking. Too severe a judgment can hardly be passed by the indignant sense of the community upon those who being better informed themselves have yet led away the ardor of youth and an illdirected love of political liberty. The correspondence between this Government and that of Spain relating to this transaction is herewith communicated.< Although these offenders against the laws have forfeited the protection of their country yet the Government may so far as consistent with its obligations to other countries and its fixed purpose to maintain and enforce the laws entertain sympathy for their unoffending families and friends as well as a feeling of compassion for themselves. Accordingly no proper effort has been spared and none will be spared to procure the release of such citizens of the United States engaged in this unlawful enterprise as are now in confinement in Spain; but it is to be hoped that such interposition with the Government of that country may not be consered as affording any ground of expectation that the Government of the United States will hereafter feel itself under any obligation of duty to intercede for the liberation or pardon of such persons as are flagrant offenders against the law of nations and the laws of the United States. These laws must be executed. If we desire to maintain our respectability among the nations of the earth it behooves us to enforce steadily and sternly the neutrality acts passed by Congress and to follow as far as may be the violation of those acts with condign punishment.< But what gives a peculiar criminality to this invasion of Cuba is that under the lead of Spanish subjects and with the a of citizens of the United States it had its origin with many in motives of cupity. Money was advanced by inuals probably in conserable amounts to purchase Cuban bonds as they have been called issued by Lopez sold doubtless at a very large discount and for the payment of which the public lands and public property of Cuba of whatever kind and the fiscal resources of the people and government of that island from whatever source to be derived were pledged as well as the good faith of the government expected to be established. All these means of payment it is event were only to be obtained by a process of bloodshed war and revolution. None will deny that those who set on foot military expeditions against foreign states by means like these are far more culpable than the ignorant and the necessitous whom they induce to go forth as the ostensible parties in the proceeding. These originators of the invasion of Cuba seem to have determined with coolness and system upon an undertaking which should disgrace their country violate its laws and put to hazard the lives of illinformed and deluded men. You will conser whether further legislation be necessary to prevent the perpetration of such offenses in future.< No inuals have a right to hazard the peace of the country or to violate its laws upon vague notions of altering or reforming governments in other states. This principle is not only reasonable in itself and in accordance with public law but is ingrafted into the codes of other nations as well as our own. But while such are the sentiments of this Government it may be added that every independent nation must be presumed to be able to defend its possessions against unauthorized inuals banded together to attack them. The Government of the United States at all times since its establishment has abstained and has sought to restrain the citizens of the country from entering into controversies between other powers and to observe all the duties of neutrality. At an early period of the Government in the Administration of Washington several laws were passed for this purpose. The main provisions of these laws were reenacted by the act of April 1818 by which amongst other things it was declared that< If any person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States begin or set on foot or prove or prepare the means for any military expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state or of any colony district or people with whom the United States are at peace every person so offending shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor and shall be fined not exceeding $3000 and imprisoned not more than three years.< And this law has been executed and enforced to the full extent of the power of the Government from that day to this.< In proclaiming and adhering to the doctrine of neutrality and nonintervention the United States have not followed the lead of other civilized nations; they have taken the lead themselves and have been followed by others. This was admitted by one of the most eminent of modern British statesmen who sa in Parliament while a minister of the Crown that if he wished for a gue in a system of neutrality he should take that la down by America in the days of Washington and the secretaryship of Jefferson; and we see in fact that the act of Congress of 1818 was followed the succeeding year by an act of the Parliament of England substantially the same in its general provisions. Up to that time there had been no similar law in England except certain highly penal statutes passed in the reign of George II prohibiting English subjects from enlisting in foreign service the avowed object of which statutes was that foreign armies raised for the purpose of restoring the house of Stuart to the throne should not be strengthened by recruits from England herself.< All must see that difficulties may arise in carrying the laws referred to into execution in a country now having 3000 or 4000 miles of seacoast with an infinite number of ports and harbors and small inlets from some of which unlawful expeditious may suddenly set forth without the knowledge of Government against the possessions of foreign states.< Friendly relations with all but entangling alliances with none has long been a maxim with us. Our true mission is not to propagate our opinions or impose upon other countries our form of government by artifice or force but to teach by example and show by our success moderation and justice the blessings of selfgovernment and the advantages of free institutions. Let every people choose for itself and make and alter its political institutions to suit its own condition and convenience. But while we avow and maintain this neutral policy ourselves we are anxious to see the same forbearance on the part of other nations whose forms of government are different from our own. The deep interest which we feel in the spread of liberal principles and the establishment of free governments and the sympathy with which we witness every struggle against oppression forb that we should be indifferent to a case in which the strong arm of a foreign power is invoked to stifle public sentiment and repress the spirit of freedom in any country.< The Governments of Great Britain and France have issued orders to their al commanders on the West India station to prevent by force if necessary the landing of adventurers from any nation on the island of Cuba with hostile intent. The copy of a memorandum of a conversation on this subject between the charge' d'affaires of Her Britannic Majesty and the Acting Secretary of State and of a subsequent note of the former to the Department of State are herewith submitted together with a copy of a note of the Acting Secretary of State to the minister of the French Republic and of the reply of the latter on the same subject. These papers will acquaint you with the grounds of this interposition of two leading commercial powers of Europe and with the apprehensions which this Government could not fail to entertain that such interposition if carried into effect might lead to abuses in derogation of the maritime rights of the United States. The maritime rights of the United States are founded on a firm secure and welldefined basis; they stand upon the ground of national independence and public law and will be maintained in all their full and just extent. The principle which this Government has heretofore solemnly announced it still adheres to and will maintain under all circumstances and at all hazards. That principle is that in every regularly documented merchant vessel the crew who igate it and those on board of it will find their protection in the flag which is over them. No American ship can be allowed to be visited or searched for the purpose of ascertaining the character of inuals on board nor can there be allowed any watch by the vessels of any foreign nation over American vessels on the coast of the United States or the seas adjacent thereto. It will be seen by the last communication from the British charge' d'affaires to the Department of State that he is authorized to assure the Secretary of State that every care will be taken that in executing the preventive measures against the expeditions which the United States Government itself has denounced as not being entitled to the protection of any government no interference shall take place with the lawful commerce of any nation.< In addition to the correspondence on this subject herewith submitted official information has been received at the Department of State of assurances by the French Government that in the orders given to the French al forces they were expressly instructed in any operations they might engage in to respect the flag of the United States wherever it might appear and to commit no act of hostility upon any vessel or armament under its protection.< Ministers and consuls of foreign nations are the means and agents of communication between us and those nations and it is of the utmost importance that while resing in the country they should feel a perfect security so long as they faithfully discharge their respective duties and are guilty of no violation of our laws. This is the admitted law of nations and no country has a deeper interest in maintaining it than the United States. Our commerce spreads over every sea and visits every clime and our ministers and consuls are appointed to protect the interests of that commerce as well as to guard the peace of the country and maintain the honor of its flag. But how can they discharge these duties unless they be themselves protected? And if protected it must be by the laws of the country in which they rese. And what is due to our own public aries resing in foreign nations is exactly the measure of what is due to the aries of other governments resing here. As in war the bearers of flags of truce are sacred or else wars would be interminable so in peace ambassadors public ministers and consuls charged with friendly national intercourse are objects of especial respect and protection each according to the rights belonging to his rank and station. In  of these important principles it is with deep mortification and regret I announce to you that during the excitement growing out of the executions at Havana the office of Her Catholic Majesty's consul at New Orleans was assailed by a mob his property destroyed the Spanish flag found in the office carried off and torn in pieces and he himself induced to flee for his personal safety which he supposed to be in danger. On receiving intelligence of these events I forthwith directed the attorney of the United States resing at New Orleans to inquire into the facts and the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained by the consul with the intention of laying them before you that you might make provision for such indemnity to him as a just regard for the honor of the nation and the respect which is due to a friendly power might in your judgment seem to require. The correspondence upon this subject between the Secretary of State and Her Catholic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary is herewith transmitted.< The occurrence at New Orleans has led me to give my attention to the state of our laws in regard to foreign ambassadors ministers and consuls. I think the legislation of the country is deficient in not proving sufficiently either for the protection or the punishment of consuls. I therefore recommend the subject to the conseration of Congress.< Your attention is again invited to the question of reciprocal trade between the United States and Canada and other British possessions near our frontier. Overtures for a convention upon this subject have been received from Her Britannic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary but it seems to be in many respects preferable that the matter should be regulated by reciprocal legislation. Documents are la before you showing the terms which the British Government is willing to offer and the measures which it may adopt if some arrangement upon this subject shall not be made.< From the accompanying copy of a note from the British legation at Washington and the reply of the Department of State thereto it will appear that Her Britannic Majesty's Government is desirous that a part of the boundary line between Oregon and the British possessions should be authoritatively marked out and that an intention was expressed to apply to Congress for an appropriation to defray the expense thereof on the part of the United States. Your attention to this subject is accordingly invited and a proper appropriation recommended. A convention for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United States against Portugal has been concluded and the ratifications have been exchanged. The first installment of the amount to be pa by Portugal fell due on the 30th of September last and has been pa. The Present of the French Republic according to the provisions of the convention has been selected as arbiter in the case of the General Armstrong and has signified that he accepts the trust and the high satisfaction he feels in acting as the common friend of two nations with which France is united by sentiments of sincere and lasting amity.< The Turkish Government has expressed its thanks for the kind reception given to the Sultan's agent Amin Bey on the occasion of his recent visit to the United States. On the 28th of February last a dispatch was addressed by the Secretary of State to Mr. Marsh the American minister at Constantinople instructing him to ask of the Turkish Government permission for the Hungarians then imprisoned within the dominions of the Sublime Porte to remove to this country. On the 3d of March last both Houses of Congress passed a resolution requesting the Present to authorize the employment of a public vessel to convey to this country Louis Kossuth and his associates in captivity. The instruction above referred to was complied with and the Turkish Government having released Governor Kossuth and his companions from prison on the 10th of September last they embarked on board of the United States steam frigate Mississippi which was selected to carry into effect the resolution of Congress. Governor Kossuth left the Mississippi at Gibraltar for the purpose of making a visit to England and may shortly be expected in New York. By communications to the Department of State he has expressed his grateful acknowledgments for the interposition of this Government in behalf of himself and his associates. This country has been justly regarded as a safe asylum for those whom political events have exiled from their own homes in Europe. and it is recommended to Congress to conser in what manner Governor Kossuth and his companions brought hither by its authority shall be received and treated.< It is earnestly to be hoped that the differences which have for some time past been pending between the Government of the French Republic and that of the Sandwich Islands may be peaceably and durably adjusted so as to secure the independence of those islands. Long before the events which have of late imparted so much importance to the possessions of the United States on the Pacific we acknowledged the independence of the Hawaiian Government. This Government was first in taking that step and several of the leading powers of Europe immediately followed. We were influenced in this measure by the existing and prospective importance of the islands as a place of refuge and refreshment for our vessels engaged in the whale fishery and by the conseration that they lie in the course of the great trade which must at no distant day be carried on between the western coast of North America and eastern Asia.< We were also influenced by a desire that those islands should not pass under the control of any other great maritime state but should remain in an independent condition and so be accessible and useful to the commerce of all nations. I need not say that the importance of these conserations has been greatly enhanced by the sudden and vast development which the interests of the United States have attained in California and Oregon and the policy heretofore adopted in regard to those islands will be steadily pursued.< It is gratifying not only to those who conser the commercial interests of nations but also to all who favor the progress of knowledge and the diffusion of religion to see a community emerge from a savage state and attain such a degree of civilization in those distant seas. It is much to be deplored that the internal tranquillity of the Mexican Republic should again be seriously disturbed for since the peace between that Republic and the United States it had enjoyed such comparative repose that the most favorable anticipations for the future might with a degree of confence have been indulged. These however have been thwarted by the recent outbreak in the State of Tamaulipas on the right bank of the Rio Bravo. Having received information that persons from the United States had taken part in the insurrection and apprehending that their example might be followed by others I caused orders to be issued for the purpose of preventing any hostile expeditions against Mexico from being set on foot in violation of the laws of the United States. I likewise issued a proclamation upon the subject a copy of which is herewith la before you. This appeared to be rendered imperative by the obligations of treaties and the general duties of good neighborhood.< In my last annual message I informed Congress that citizens of the United States had undertaken the connection of the two oceans by means of a railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec under a grant of the Mexican Government to a citizen of that Republic and that this enterprise would probably be prosecuted with energy whenever Mexico should consent to such stipulations with the Government of the United States as should impart a feeling of security to those who should invest their property in the enterprise. A convention between the two Governments for the accomplishment of that end has been ratified by this Government and only awaits the decision of the Congress and the Executive of that Republic.< Some unexpected difficulties and delays have arisen in the ratification of that convention by Mexico but it is to be presumed that her decision will be governed by just and enlightened s as well of the general importance of the object as of her own interests and obligations.< In negotiating upon this important subject this Government has had in  one and only one object. That object has been and is the construction or attainment of a passage from ocean to ocean the shortest and the best for travelers and merchandise and equally open to all the world. It has sought to obtain no territorial acquisition nor any advantages peculiar to itself; and it would see with the greatest regret that Mexico should oppose any obstacle to the accomplishment of an enterprise which promises so much convenience to the whole commercial world and such eminent advantages to Mexico herself. Impressed with these sentiments and these convictions the Government will continue to exert all proper efforts to bring about the necessary arrangement with the Republic of Mexico for the speedy completion of the work. For some months past the Republic of Nicaragua has been the theater of one of those civil convulsions from which the cause of free institutions and the general prosperity and social progress of the States of Central America have so often and so severely suffered. Until quiet shall have been restored and a government apparently stable shall have been organized no advance can prudently be made in disposing of the questions pending between the two countries.< I am happy to announce that an interoceanic communication from the mouth of the St. John to the Pacific has been so far accomplished as that passengers have actually traversed it and merchandise has been transported over it and when the canal shall have been completed according to the original plan the means of communication will be further improved. It is understood that a conserable part of the railroad across the Isthmus of Panama has been completed and that the mail and passengers will in future be conveyed thereon. Whichever of the several routes between the two oceans may ultimately prove most eligible for travelers to and from the different States on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and our coast on the Pacific there is little reason to doubt that all of them will be useful to the public and will liberally reward that inual enterprise by which alone they have been or are expected to be carried into effect. Peace has been concluded between the contending parties in the island of St. Domingo and it is hoped upon a durable basis. Such is the extent of our commercial relations with that island that the United States can not fail to feel a strong interest in its tranquillity. The office of commissioner to China remains unfilled. Several persons have been appointed and the place has been offered to others all of whom have declined its acceptance on the ground of the inadequacy of the compensation. The annual allowance by law is $6000 and there is no provision for any outfit. I earnestly recommend the conseration of this subject to Congress. Our commerce with China is highly important and is becoming more and more so in consequence of the increasing intercourse between our ports on the Pacific Coast and eastern Asia. China is understood to be a country in which living is very expensive and I know of no reason why the American commissioner sent thither should not be placed in regard to compensation on an equal footing with ministers who represent this country at the Courts of Europe.< By reference to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury it will be seen that the aggregate receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $52312979.87 which with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st July 1850 gave as the available means for the year the sum of $58917524.36.< The total expenditures for the same period were $48005878.68. The total imports for the year ending June 30 1851 were $215725995 of which there were in specie $4967901. The exports for the same period were $217517130 of which there were of domestic products $178546555; foreign goods reexported $9738695; specie $29231880.< Since the 1st of December last the payments in cash on account of the public debt exclusive of interest have amounted to $7501456.56 which however includes the sum of $3242400 pa under the twelfth article of the treaty with Mexico and the further sum of $2591213.45 being the amount of awards to American citizens under the late treaty with Mexico for which the issue of stock was authorized but which was pa in cash from the Treasury.< The public debt on the 20th ultimo exclusive of the stock authorized to be issued to Texas by the act of 9th September 1850 was $62560395.26.< The receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at $51800000 which with the probable unappropriated balance in the Treasury on the 30th June next will give as the probable available means for that year the sum of $63258743.09.< It has been deemed proper in  of the large expenditures consequent upon the acquisition of territory from Mexico that the estimates for the next fiscal year should be la before Congress in such manner as to distinguish the expenditures so required from the otherwise ordinary demands upon the Treasury.< The total expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated at $42892299.19 of which there is required for the ordinary purposes of the Government other than those consequent upon the acquisition of our new territories and deducting the payments on account of the public debt the sum of $33343198.08 and for the purposes connected directly or indirectly with those territories and in the fulfillment of the obligations of the Government contracted in consequence of their acquisition the sum of $9549101.11.< If the s of the Secretary of the Treasury in reference to the expenditures required for these territories shall be met by corresponding action on the part of Congress and appropriations made in accordance therewith there will be an estimated unappropriated balance in the Treasury on the 30th June 1853 of $20366443.90 wherewith to meet that portion of the public debt due on the 1st of July following amounting to $6237931.35 as well as any appropriations which may be made beyond the estimates.< In thus referring to the estimated expenditures on account of our newly acquired territories I may express the hope that Congress will concur with me in the desire that a liberal course of policy may be pursued toward them and that every obligation express or implied entered into in consequence of their acquisition shall be fulfilled by the most liberal appropriations for that purpose.< The values of our domestic exports for the last fiscal year as compared with those of the previous year exhibit an increase of $43646322. At first  this condition of our trade with foreign nations would seem to present the most flattering hopes of its future prosperity. An examination of the details of our exports however will show that the increased value of our exports for the last fiscal year is to be found in the high price of cotton which prevailed during the first half of that year which price has since declined about onehalf.< The value of our exports of breadstuffs and provisions which it was supposed the incentive of a low tariff and large importations from abroad would have greatly augmented has fallen from $68701921 in 1847 to $26051373 in 1850 and to $21948653 in 1851 with a strong probability amounting almost to a certainty of a still further reduction in the current year.< The aggregate values of rice exported during the last fiscal year as compared with the previous year also exhibit a decrease amounting to $460917 which with a decline in the values of the exports of tobacco for the same period make an aggregate decrease in these two articles of $1156751.< The policy which dictated a low rate of duties on foreign merchandise it was thought by those who promoted and established it would tend to benefit the farming population of this country by increasing the demand and raising the price of agricultural products in foreign markets.< The foregoing facts however seem to s
ow incontestably that no such result has followed the adoption of this policy. On the contrary notwithstanding the repeal of the restrictive corn laws in England the foreign demand for the products of the American farmer has steadily declined since the short crops and consequent famine in a portion of Europe have been happily replaced by full crops and comparative abundance of food.< It will be seen by recurring to the commercial statistics for the past year that the value of our domestic exports has been increased in the single item of raw cotton by $40000000 over the value of that export for the year preceding. This is not due to any increased general demand for that article but to the short crop of the preceding year which created an increased demand and an augmented price for the crop of last year. Should the cotton crop now going forward to market be only equal in quantity to that of the year preceding and be sold at the present prices then there would be a falling off in the value of our exports for the present fiscal year of at least $40000000 compared with the amount exported for the year ending 30th June 1851.< The production of gold in California for the past year seems to promise a large supply of that metal from that quarter for some time to come. This large annual increase of the currency of the world must be attended with its usual results. These have been already partially disclosed in the enhancement of prices and a rising spirit of speculation and adventure tending to overtrading as well at home as abroad. Unless some salutary check shall be given to these tendencies it is to be feared that importations of foreign goods beyond a healthy demand in this country will lead to a sudden drain of the precious metals from us bringing with it as it has done in former times the most disastrous consequences to the business and capital of the American people.< The exports of specie to liquate our foreign debt during the past fiscal year have been $24963979 over the amount of specie imported. The exports of specie during the first quarter of the present fiscal year have been $14651827. Should specie continue to be exported at this rate for the remaining three quarters of this year it will drain from our metallic currency during the year ending 30th June 1852 the enormous amount of $58607308.< In the present prosperous condition of the national finances it will become the duty of Congress to conser the best mode of paying off the public debt. If the present and anticipated surplus in the Treasury should not be absorbed by appropriations of an extraordinary character this surplus should be employed in such way and under such restrictions as Congress may enact in extinguishing the outstanding debt of the nation.< By reference to the act of Congress approved 9th September 1850 it will be seen that in conseration of certain concessions by the State of Texas it is proved that< The United States shall pay to the State of Texas the sum of $10000000 in a stock bearing 5 per cent interest and redeemable at the end of fourteen years the interest payable halfyearly at the Treasury of the United States.< In the same section of the law it is further proved< That no more than five millions of sa stock shall be issued until the creditors of the State holding bonds and other certificates of stock of Texas for which duties on imports were specially pledged shall first file at the Treasury of the United States releases of all claims against the United States for or on account of sa bonds or certificates in such form as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and approved by the Present of the United States.< The form of release thus proved for has been prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and approved. It has been published in all the leading newspapers in the commercial cities of the United States and all persons holding claims of the kind specified in the foregoing proviso were required to file their releases (in the form thus prescribed) in the Treasury of the United States on or before the 1st day of October 1851. Although this publication has been continued from the 25th day of March 1851 yet up to the 1st of October last comparatively few releases had been filed by the creditors of Texas.< The authorities of the State of Texas at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury have furnished a schedule of the public debt of that State created prior to her admission into the Union with a copy of the laws under which each  was contracted. I have from the documents furnished by the State of Texas determined the es of claims which in my judgment fall within the provisions of the act of Congress of the 9th of September 1850.< On being officially informed of the acceptance by Texas of the propositions contained in the act referred to I caused the stock to be prepared and the five millions which are to be issued unconditionally bearing an interest of 5 per cent from the 1st day of January 1851 have been for some time ready to be delivered to the State of Texas. The authorities of Texas up to the present time have not authorized anyone to receive this stock and it remains in the Treasury Department subject to the order of Texas. The releases required by law to be deposited in the Treasury not having been filed there the remaining five millions have not been issued. This last amount of the stock will be withheld from Texas until the conditions upon which it is to be delivered shall be complied with by the creditors of that State unless Congress shall otherwise direct by a modification of the law.< In my last annual message to which I respectfully refer I stated briefly the reasons which induced me to recommend a modification of the present tariff by converting the ad valorem into a specific duty wherever the article imported was of such a character as to permit it and that such a discrimination should be made in favor of the industrial pursuits of our own country as to encourage home production without excluding foreign competition.< The numerous frauds which continue to be practiced upon the revenue by false invoices and undervaluations constitute an unanswerable reason for adopting specific instead of ad valorem duties in all cases where the nature of the commodity does not forb it. A striking illustration of these frauds will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury showing the customhouse valuation of articles imported under a former law subject to specific duties when there was no inducement to undervaluation and the customhouse valuations of the same articles under the present system of ad valorem duties so greatly reduced as to leave no doubt of the existence of the most flagrant abuses under the existing laws. This practical evasion of the present law combined with the languishing condition of some of the great interests of the country caused by over importations and consequent depressed prices and with the failure in obtaining a foreign market for our increasing surplus of breadstuffs and provisions has induced me again to recommend a modification of the existing tariff. The report of the Secretary of the Interior which accompanies this communication will present a condensed statement of the operations of that important Department of the Government.< It will be seen that the cash sales of the public lands exceed those of the preceding year and that there is reason to anticipate a still further increase notwithstanding the large donations which have been made to many of the States and the liberal grants to inuals as a reward for military services. This fact furnishes very gratifying evence of the growing wealth and prosperity of our country.< Suitable measures have been adopted for commencing the survey of the public lands in California and Oregon. Surveying parties have been organized and some progress has been made in establishing the principal base and merian lines. But further legislation and additional appropriations will be necessary before the proper subisions can be made and the general land system extended over those remote parts of our territory.< On the 3d of March last an act was passed proving for the appointment of three commissioners to settle private land claims in California. Three persons were immediately appointed all of whom however declined accepting the office in consequence of the inadequacy of the compensation. Others were promptly selected who for the same reason also declined and it was not until late in the season that the services of suitable persons could be secured. A majority of the commissioners convened in this city on the 10th of September last when detailed instructions were given to them in regard to their duties. Their first meeting for the transaction of business will be held in San Francisco on the 8th day of the present month.< I have thought it proper to refer to these facts not only to explain the causes of the delay in filling the commission but to call your attention to the propriety of increasing the compensation of the commissioners. The office is one of great labor and responsibility and the compensation should be such as to command men of a high order of talents and the most unquestionable integrity.< The proper disposal of the mineral lands of California is a subject surrounded by great difficulties. In my last annual message I recommended the survey and sale of them in small parcels under such restrictions as would effectually guard against monopoly and speculation; but upon further information and in deference to the opinions of persons familiar with the subject I am inclined to change that recommendation and to advise that they be permitted to remain as at present a common field open to the enterprise and industry of all our citizens until further experience shall have developed the best policy to be ultimately adopted in regard to them. It is safer to suffer the inconveniences that now exist for a short period than by premature legislation to fasten on the country a system founded in error which may place the whole subject beyond the future control of Congress.< The agricultural lands should however be surveyed and brought into market with as little delay as possible that the titles may become settled and the inhabitants stimulated to make permanent improvements and enter on the ordinary pursuits of life. To effect these objects it is desirable that the necessary provision be made by law for the establishment of land offices in California and Oregon and for the efficient prosecution of the surveys at an early day.< Some difficulties have occurred in organizing the Territorial governments of New Mexico and Utah and when more accurate information shall be obtained of the causes a further communication will be made on that subject.< In my last annual communication to Congress I recommended the establishment of an agricultural bureau and I take this occasion again to invoke your favorable conseration of the subject.< Agriculture may justly be regarded as the great interest of our people. Fourfifths of our active population are employed in the cultivation of the soil and the rap expansion of our settlements over new territory is daily adding to the number of those engaged in that vocation. Justice and sound policy therefore alike require that the Government should use all the means authorized by the Constitution to promote the interests and welfare of that important  of our fellowcitizens. And yet it is a singular fact that whilst the manufacturing and commercial interests have engaged the attention of Congress during a large portion of every session and our statutes abound in provisions for their protection and encouragement little has yet been done directly for the advancement of agriculture. It is time that this reproach to our legislation should be removed and I sincerely hope that the present Congress will not close their labors without adopting efficient means to supply the omissions of those who have preceded them.< An agricultural bureau charged with the duty of collecting and disseminating correct information as to the best modes of cultivation and of the most effectual means of preserving and restoring the fertility of the soil and of procuring and distributing seeds and plants and other vegetable productions with instructions in regard to the soil climate and treatment best adapted to their growth could not fail to be in the language of Washington in his last annual message to Congress a very cheap instrument of immense national benefit.< Regarding the act of Congress approved 28th September 1850 granting bounty lands to persons who had been engaged in the military service of the country as a great measure of national justice and munificence an anxious desire has been felt by the officers intrusted with its immediate execution to give prompt effect to its provisions. All the means within their control were therefore brought into requisition to expedite the adjudication of claims and I am gratified to be able to state that near 100000 applications have been consered and about 70000 warrants issued within the short space of nine months. If adequate provision be made by law to carry into effect the recommendations of the Department it is confently expected that before the close of the next fiscal year all who are entitled to the benefits of the act will have received their warrants.< The Secretary of the Interior has suggested in his report various amendments of the laws relating to pensions and bounty lands for the purpose of more effectually guarding against abuses and frauds on the Government to all of which I invite your particular attention. The large accessions to our Indian population consequent upon the acquisition of New Mexico and California and the extension of our settlements into Utah and Oregon have given increased interest and importance to our relations with the aboriginal race. No material change has taken place within the last year in the condition and prospects of the Indian tribes who rese in the Northwestern Territory and west of the Mississippi River. We are at peace with all of them and it will be a source of pleasure to you to learn that they are gradually advancing in civilization and the pursuits of social life.< Along the Mexican frontier and in California and Oregon there have been occasional manifestations of unfriendly feeling and some depredations committed. I am satisfied however that they resulted more from the destitute and starving condition of the Indians than from any settled hostility toward the whites. As the settlements of our citizens progress toward them the game upon which they mainly rely for subsistence is driven off or destroyed and the only alternative left to them is starvation or plunder. It becomes us to conser in  of this condition of things whether justice and humanity as well as an enlightened economy do not require that instead of seeking to punish them for offenses which are the result of our own policy toward them we should not prove for their immediate wants and encourage them to engage in agriculture and to rely on their labor instead of the chase for the means of support.< Various important treaties have been negotiated with different tribes during the year by which their title to large and valuable tracts of country has been extinguished all of which will at the proper time be submitted to the Senate for ratification.< The joint commission under the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo has been actively engaged in running and marking the boundary line between the United States and Mexico. It was stated in the last annual report of the Secretary of the Interior that the initial point on the Pacific and the point of junction of the Gila with the Colorado River had been determined and the intervening line about 150 miles in length run and marked by temporary monuments. Since that time a monument of marble has been erected at the initial point and permanent landmarks of iron have been placed at suitable distances along the line.< The initial point on the Rio Grande has also been fixed by the commissioners at latitude 32 degrees 22' and at the date of the last communication the survey of the line had been made thence westward about 150 miles to the neighborhood of the copper mines. The commission on our part was at first organized on a scale which experience proved to be unwieldy and attended with unnecessary expense. Orders have therefore been issued for the reduction of the number of persons employed within the smallest limits consistent with the safety of those engaged in the service and the prompt and efficient execution of their important duties.< Returns have been received from all the officers engaged in taking the census in the States and Territories except California. The superintendent employed to make the enumeration in that State has not yet made his full report from causes as he alleges beyond his control. This failure is much to be regretted as it has prevented the Secretary of the Interior from making the decennial apportionment of Representatives among the States as required by the act approved May 23 1850. It is hoped however that the returns will soon be received and no time will then be lost in making the necessary apportionment and in transmitting the certificates required by law.< The Superintendent of the Seventh Census is diligently employed under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior in ifying and arranging in tabular form all the statistical information derived from the returns of the marshals and it is believed that when the work shall be completed it will exhibit a more perfect  of the population wealth occupations and social condition of a great country than has ever been presented to the world. The value of such a work as the basis of enlightened legislation can hardly be overestimated and I earnestly hope that Congress will lose no time in making the appropriations necessary to complete the ifications and to publish the results in a  worthy of the subject and of our national character.< The want of a uniform fee bill prescribing the compensation to be allowed district attorneys clerks marshals and commissioners in civil and criminal cases is the cause of much vexation injustice and complaint. I would recommend a thorough revision of the laws on the whole subject and the adoption of a tariff of fees which as far as practicable should be uniform and prescribe a specific compensation for every service which the officer may be required to perform. This subject will be fully presented in the report of the Secretary of the Interior. In my last annual message I gave briefly my reasons for believing that you possessed the constitutional power to improve the harbors of our Great Lakes and seacoast and the igation of our principal rivers and recommended that appropriations should be made for completing such works as had already been commenced and for commencing such others as might seem to the wisdom of Congress to be of public and general importance. Without repeating the reasons then urged I deem it my duty again to call your attention to this important subject. The works on many of the harbors were left in an unfinished state and consequently exposed to the action of the elements which is fast destroying them. Great numbers of lives and vast amounts of property are annually lost for want of safe and convenient harbors on the Lakes. None but those who have been exposed to that dangerous igation can fully appreciate the importance of this subject. The whole Northwest appeals to you for relief and I trust their appeal will receive due conseration at your hands.< The same is in a measure true in regard to some of the harbors and inlets on the seacoast.< The unobstructed igation of our large rivers is of equal importance. Our settlements are now extending to the sources of the great rivers which empty into and form a part of the Mississippi and the value of the public lands in those regions would be greatly enhanced by freeing the igation of those waters from obstructions. In  therefore of this great interest I deem it my duty again to urge upon Congress to make such appropriations for these improvements as they may deem necessary.< The surveys of the Delta of the Mississippi with a  to the prevention of the overflows that have proved so disastrous to that region of country have been nearly completed and the reports thereof are now in course of preparation and will shortly be la before you.< The protection of our southwestern frontier and of the adjacent Mexican States against the Indian tribes within our border has claimed my earnest and constant attention. Congress having failed at the last session to adopt my recommendation that an additional regiment of mounted men specially adapted to that service should be raised all that remained to be done was to make the best use of the means at my disposal. Accordingly all the troops adapted to that service that could properly be spared from other quarters have been concentrated on that frontier and officers of high reputation selected to command them. A new arrangement of the military posts has also been made whereby the troops are brought nearer to the Mexican frontier and to the tribes they are intended to overawe.< Sufficient time has not yet elapsed to realize all the benefits that are expected to result from these arrangements but I have every reason to hope that they will effectually check their marauding expeditions. The nature of the country which furnishes little for the support of an army and abounds in places of refuge and concealment is remarkably well adapted to this predatory warfare and we can scarcely hope that any military force combined with the greatest vigilance can entirely suppress it.< By the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo we are bound to protect the territory of Mexico against the incursions of the savage tribes within our border with equal diligence and energy as if the same were made within our territory or against our citizens. I have endeavored to comply as far as possible with this provision of the treaty. Orders have been given to the officers commanding on that frontier to conser the Mexican territory and its inhabitants as equally with our own entitled to their protection and to make all their plans and arrangements with a  to the attainment of this object. Instructions have also been given to the Indian commissioners and agents among these tribes in all treaties to make the clauses designed for the protection of our own citizens apply also to those of Mexico. I have no reason to doubt that these instructions have been fully carried into effect; nevertheless it is probable that in spite of all our efforts some of the neighboring States of Mexico may have suffered as our own have from depredations by the Indians.< To the difficulties of defending our own territory as above mentioned are superadded in defending that of Mexico those that arise from its remoteness from the fact that we have no right to station our troops within her limits and that there is no efficient military force on the Mexican se to cooperate with our own.< So long as this shall continue to be the case the number and activity of our troops will rather increase than diminish the evil as the Indians will naturally turn toward that country where they encounter the least resistance. Yet these troops are necessary to subdue them and to compel them to make and observe treaties. Until this shall have been done neither country will enjoy any security from their attacks.< The Indians in California who had previously appeared of a peaceable character and disposed to cultivate the friendship of the whites have recently committed several acts of hostility. As a large portion of the reenforcements sent to the Mexican frontier were drawn from the Pacific the military force now stationed there is consered entirely inadequate to its defense. It can not be increased however without an increase of the Army and I again recommend that measure as indispensable to the protection of the frontier.< I invite your attention to the suggestions on this subject and on others connected with his Department in the report of the Secretary of War. The appropriations for the support of the Army during the current fiscal year ending 30th June next were reduced far below the estimate submitted by the Department. The consequence of this reduction is a conserable deficiency to which I invite your early attention. The expenditures of that Department for the year ending 30th June last were $9060268.58 The estimates for the year commencing 1st July next and ending June 30 1853 are $7898775.83 showing a reductions of $1161492.75 The board of commissioners to whom the management of the affairs of the military asylum created by the act of 3d March last was intrusted have selected a site for the establishment of an asylum in the vicinity of this city which has been approved by me subject to the production of a satisfactory title.< The report of the Secretary of the Navy will exhibit the condition of the public service under the supervision of that Department. Our al force afloat during the present year has been actively and usefully employed in giving protection to our wely extended and increasing commerce and interests in the various quarters of the globe and our flag has everywhere afforded the security and received the respect inspired by the justice and liberality of our intercourse and the dignity and power of the nation.< The expedition commanded by Lieutenant De Haven dispatched in search of the British commander Sir John Franklin and his companions in the Arctic Seas returned to New York in the month of October after having undergone great peril and suffering from an unknown and dangerous igation and the rigors of a northern climate without any satisfactory information of the objects of their search but with new contributions to science and igation from the unfrequented polar regions. The officers and men of the expedition having been all volunteers for this service and having so conducted it as to meet the entire approbation of the Government it is suggested as an act of grace and generosity that the same allowance of extra pay and emoluments be extended to them that were made to the officers and men of like rating in the late exploring expedition to the South Seas.< I earnestly recommend to your attention the necessity of reorganizing the al establishment apportioning and fixing the number of officers in each grade proving some mode of promotion to the higher grades of the Navy having reference to merit and capacity rather than seniority or date of entry into the service and for retiring from the effective list upon reduced pay those who may be incompetent to the performance of active duty. As a measure of economy as well as of efficiency in this arm of the service the provision last mentioned is eminently worthy of your conseration.< The determination of the questions of relative rank between the sea officers and civil officers of the Navy and between officers of the Army and Navy in the various grades of each will also merit your attention. The failure to prove any substitute when corporal punishment was abolished for offenses in the Navy has occasioned the convening of numerous courtsmartial upon the arrival of vessels in port and is believed to have had an injurious effect upon the discipline and efficiency of the service. To moderate punishment from one grade to another is among the humane reforms of the age but to abolish one of severity which applied so generally to offenses on shipboard and prove nothing in its stead is to suppose a progress of improvement in every inual among seamen which is not assumed by the Legislature in respect to any other  of men. It is hoped that Congress in the ample opportunity afforded by the present session will thoroughly investigate this important subject and establish such modes of determining guilt and such gradations of punishment as are consistent with humanity and the personal rights of inuals and at the same time shall insure the most energetic and efficient performance of duty and the suppression of crime in our ships of war.< The stone dock in the yyard at New York which was ten years in process of construction has been so far finished as to be surrendered up to the authorities of the yard. The dry dock at Philadelphia is reported as completed and is expected soon to be tested and delivered over to the agents of the Government. That at Portsmouth N. H. is also nearly ready for delivery; and a contract has been concluded agreeably to the act of Congress at its last session for a floating sectional dock on the Bay of San Francisco. I invite your attention to the recommendation of the Department touching the establishment of a yyard in conjunction with this dock on the Pacific. Such a station is highly necessary to the convenience and effectiveness of our fleet in that ocean which must be expected to increase with the growth of commerce and the rap extension of our whale fisheries over its waters.< The Naval Academy at Annapolis under a revised and improved system of regulations now affords opportunities of education and instruction to the pupils quite equal it is believed for professional improvement to those enjoyed by the cadets in the Military Academy. A large  of acting mshipmen was received at the commencement of the last academic term and a practice ship has been attached to the institution to afford the amplest means for regular instruction in seamanship as well as for cruises during the vacations of three or four months in each year.< The advantages of science in nautical affairs have rarely been more strikingly illustrated than in the fact stated in the report of the Navy Department that by means of the wind and current charts projected and prepared by Lieutenant Maury the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory the passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific ports of our country has been shortened by about forty days.< The estimates for the support of the Navy and Marine Corps the ensuing fiscal year will be found to be $5856472.19 the estimates for the current year being $5900621.< The estimates for special objects under the control of this Department amount to $2684220.89 against $2210980 for the present year the increase being occasioned by the additional mail service on the Pacific Coast and the construction of the dock in California authorized at the last session of Congress and some slight additions under the head of improvements and repairs in yyards buildings and machinery. I deem it of much importance to a just economy and a correct understanding of al expenditures that there should be an entire separation of the appropriations for the support of the al service proper from those for permanent improvements at yyards and stations and from ocean steam mail service and other special objects assigned to the supervision of this Department.< The report of the PostmasterGeneral herewith communicated presents an interesting  of the progress operations and condition of his Department.< At the close of the last fiscal year the length of mail routes within the United States was 196290 miles the annual transportation thereon 53272252 miles and the annual cost of such transportation $3421754.< The length of the foreign mail routes is estimated at 18349 miles and the annual transportation thereon at 615206 miles. The annual cost of this service is $1472187 of which $448937 are pa by the PostOffice Department and $1023250 are pa through the Navy Department.< The annual transportation within the United States excluding the service in California and Oregon which is now for the first time reported and embraced in the tabular statements of the Department exceeds that of the preceding year 6162855 miles at an increased cost of $547110.< The whole number of postoffices in the United States on the 30th day of June last was 19796. There were 1698 postoffices established and 256 discontinued during the year.< The gross revenues of the Department for the fiscal year including the appropriations for the franked matter of Congress of the Departments and officers of Government and excluding the foreign postages collected for and payable to the British postoffice amounted to $6727866.78.< The expenditures for the same period excluding $20599.49 pa under an award of the Auditor in pursuance of a resolution of the last Congress for mail service on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in 1832 and 1833 and the amount pa to the British postoffice for foreign postages collected for and payable to that office amounted to $6024566.79 leaving a balanc
 of revenue over the proper expenditures of the year of $703299.99.< The receipts for postages during the year excluding the foreign postages collected for and payable to the British postoffice amounted to $6345747.21 being an increase of $997610.79 or 18.65 per cent over the like receipts for the preceding year.< The reduction of postage under the act of March last d not take effect until the commencement of the present fiscal year. The accounts for the first quarter under the operation of the reduced rates will not be settled before January next and no reliable estimate of the receipts for the present year can yet be made. It is believed however that they will fall far short of those of the last year. The surplus of the revenues now on hand is however so large that no further appropriation from the Treasury in a of the revenues of the Department is required for the current fiscal year but an additional appropriation for the year ending June 30 1853 will probably be found necessary when the receipts of the first two quarters of the fiscal year are fully ascertained.< In his last annual report the PostmasterGeneral recommended a reduction of postage to rates which he deemed as low as could be prudently adopted unless Congress was prepared to appropriate from the Treasury for the support of the Department a sum more than equivalent to the mail services performed by it for the Government. The recommendations of the PostmasterGeneral in respect to letter postage except on letters from and to California and Oregon were substantially adopted by the last Congress. now recommends adherence to the present letter rates and advises against a further reduction until justified by the revenue of the Department.< also recommends that the rates of postage on printed matter be so revised as to render them more simple and more uniform in their operation upon all es of printed matter. I submit the recommendations of the report to your favorable conseration.< The public statutes of the United States have now been accumulating for more than sixty years and interspersed with private acts are scattered through numerous volumes and from the cost of the whole have become almost inaccessible to the great mass of the community. They also exhibit much of the incongruity and imperfection of hasty legislation. As it seems to be generally conceded that there is no common law of the United States to supply the defects of their legislation it is most important that that legislation should be as perfect as possible defining every power intended to be conferred every crime intended to be made punishable and prescribing the punishment to be inflicted. In addition to some particular cases spoken of more at length the whole criminal code is now lamentably defective. Some offenses are imperfectly described and others are entirely omitted so that flagrant crimes may be committed with impunity. The scale of punishment is not in all cases graduated according to the degree and nature of the offense and is often rendered more unequal by the different modes of imprisonment or penitentiary confinement in the different States.< Many laws of a permanent character have been introduced into appropriation bills and it is often difficult to determine whether the particular clause expires with the temporary act of which it is a part or continues in force. It has also frequently happened that enactments and provisions of law have been introduced into bills with the title or general subject of which they have little or no connection or relation. In this mode of legislation so many enactments have been heaped upon each other and often with but little conseration that in many instances it is difficult to search out and determine what is the law.< The Government of the United States is emphatically a government of written laws. The statutes should therefore as far as practicable not only be made accessible to all but be expressed in language so plain and simple as to be understood by all and arranged in such method as to give perspicuity to every subject. Many of the States have revised their public acts with great and manifest benefit and I recommend that provision be made by law for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statutes of the United States arranging them in order supplying deficiencies correcting incongruities simplifying their language and reporting them to Congress for its action.< An act of Congress approved 30th September 1850 contained a provision for the extension of the Capitol according to such plan as might be approved by the Present and appropriated $100000 to be expended under his direction by such architect as he should appoint to execute the same. On examining the various plans which had been submitted by different architects in pursuance of an advertisement by a committee of the Senate no one was found to be entirely satisfactory and it was therefore deemed advisable to combine and adopt the advantages of several.< The great object to be accomplished was to make such an addition as would afford ample and convenient halls for the deliberations of the two Houses of Congress with sufficient accommodations for spectators and suitable apartments for the committees and officers of the two branches of the Legislature. It was also desirable not to mar the harmony and beauty of the present structure which as a specimen of architecture is so universally admired. Keeping these objects in  I concluded to make the addition by wings detached from the present building yet connected with it by corrors. This mode of enlargement will leave the present Capitol uninjured and afford great advantages for ventilation and the admission of light and will enable the work to progress without interrupting the deliberations of Congress. To carry this plan into effect I have appointed an experienced and competent architect. The corner stone was la on the 4th day of July last with suitable ceremonies since which time the work has advanced with commendable rapity and the foundations of both wings are now nearly complete.< I again commend to your favorable regard the interests of the District of Columbia and deem it only necessary to remind you that although its inhabitants have no voice in the choice of Representatives in Congress they are not the less entitled to a just and liberal conseration in your legislation. My opinions on this subject were more fully expressed in my last annual communication.< Other subjects were brought to the attention of Congress in my last annual message to which I would respectfully refer. But there was one of more than ordinary interest to which I again invite your special attention. I allude to the recommendation for the appointment of a commission to settle private claims against the United States. Justice to inuals as well as to the Government imperatively demands that some more convenient and expeditious mode than an appeal to Congress should be adopted.< It is deeply to be regretted that in several instances officers of the Government in attempting to execute the law for the return of fugitives from labor have been openly resisted and their efforts frustrated and defeated by lawless and violent mobs; that in one case such resistance resulted in the death of an estimable citizen and in others serious injury ensued to those officers and to inuals who were using their endeavors to sustain the laws. Prosecutions have been instituted against the alleged offenders so far as they could be entified and are still pending. I have regarded it as my duty in these cases to give all a legally in my power to the enforcement of the laws and I shall continue to do so wherever and whenever their execution may be resisted.< The act of Congress for the return of fugitives from labor is one required and demanded by the express words of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that No person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due. This constitutional provision is equally obligatory upon the legislative the executive and judicial departments of the Government and upon every citizen of the United States.< Congress however must from necessity first act upon the subject by prescribing the proceedings necessary to ascertain that the person is a fugitive and the means to be used for his restoration to the claimant. This was done by an act passed during the first term of Present Washington which was amended by that enacted by the last Congress and it now remains for the executive and judicial departments to take care that these laws be faithfully executed. This injunction of the Constitution is as peremptory and as binding as any other; it stands exactly on the same foundation as that clause which proves for the return of fugitives from justice or that which declares that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed or that which proves for an equality of taxation according to the census or the clause declaring that all duties shall be uniform throughout the United States or the important provision that the trial of all crimes shall be by jury. These several articles and clauses of the Constitution all resting on the same authority must stand or fall together. Some objections have been urged against the details of the act for the return of fugitives from labor but it is worthy of remark that the main opposition is aimed against the Constitution itself and proceeds from persons and es of persons many of whom declare their wish to see that Constitution overturned. They avow their hostility to any law which shall give full and practical effect to this requirement of the Constitution. Fortunately the number of these persons is comparatively small and is believed to be daily diminishing; but the issue which they present is one which involves the supremacy and even the existence of the Constitution.< Cases have heretofore arisen in which inuals have denied the binding authority of acts of Congress and even States have proposed to nullify such acts upon the ground that the Constitution was the supreme law of the land and that those acts of Congress were repugnant to that instrument; but nullification is now aimed not so much against particular laws as being inconsistent with the Constitution as against the Constitution itself and it is not to be disguised that a spirit exists and has been actively at work to rend asunder this Union which is our cherished inheritance from our Revolutionary fathers.< In my last annual message I stated that I consered the series of measures which had been adopted at the previous session in reference to the agitation growing out of the Territorial and slavery questions as a final settlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and exciting subjects which they embraced and I recommended adherence to the adjustment established by those measures until time and experience should demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse. I was not induced to make this recommendation because I thought those measures perfect for no human legislation can be perfect. We differences and jarring opinions can only be reconciled by yielding something on all ses and this result had been reached after an angry conflict of many months in which one part of the country was arrayed against another and violent convulsion seemed to be imminent. Looking at the interests of the whole country I felt it to be my duty to seize upon this compromise as the best that could be obtained am conflicting interests and to insist upon it as a final settlement to be adhered to by all who value the peace and welfare of the country. A year has now elapsed since that recommendation was made. To that recommendation I still adhere and I congratulate you and the country upon the general acquiescence in these measures of peace which has been exhibited in all parts of the Republic. And not only is there this general acquiescence in these measures but the spirit of conciliation which has been manifested in regard to them in all parts of the country has removed doubts and uncertainties in the minds of thousands of good men concerning the durability of our popular institutions and given renewed assurance that our liberty and our Union may subsist together for the benefit of this and all succeeding generations.< 
FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:< The brief space which has elapsed since the close of your last session has been marked by no extraordinary political event. The quadrennial election of Chief Magistrate has passed off with less than the usual excitement. However inuals and parties may have been disappointed in the result it is nevertheless a subject of national congratulation that the choice has been effected by the independent suffrages of a free people undisturbed by those influences which in other countries have too often affected the purity of popular elections.< Our grateful thanks are due to an allmerciful Provence not only for staying the pestilence which in different forms has desolated some of our cities but for crowning the labors of the husbandman with an abundant harvest and the nation generally with the blessings of peace and prosperity.< Within a few weeks the public mind has been deeply affected by the death of Daniel Webster filling at his decease the office of Secretary of State. His associates in the executive government have sincerely sympathized with his family and the public generally on this mournful occasion. His commanding talents his great political and professional eminence his welltried patriotism and his long and faithful services in the most important public trusts have caused his death to be lamented throughout the country and have earned for him a lasting place in our history. In the course of the last summer conserable anxiety was caused for a short time by an official intimation from the Government of Great Britain that orders had been given for the protection of the fisheries upon the coasts of the British provinces in North America against the alleged encroachments of the fishing vessels of the United States and France. The shortness of this notice and the season of the year seemed to make it a matter of urgent importance. It was at first apprehended that an increased al force had been ordered to the fishing grounds to carry into effect the British interpretation of those provisions in the convention of 1818 in reference to the true intent of which the two Governments differ. It was soon discovered that such was not the design of Great Britain and satisfactory explanations of the real objects of the measure have been given both here and in London.< The unadjusted difference however between the two Governments as to the interpretation of the first article of the convention of 1818 is still a matter of importance. American fishing vessels within nine or ten years have been excluded from waters to which they had free access for twentyfive years after the negotiation of the treaty. In 1845 this exclusion was relaxed so far as concerns the Bay of Fundy but the just and liberal intention of the home Government in compliance with what we think the true construction of the convention to open all the other outer bays to our fishermen was abandoned in consequence of the opposition of the colonies. Notwithstanding this the United States have since the Bay of Fundy was reopened to our fishermen in 1845 pursued the most liberal course toward the colonial fishing interests. By the revenue law of 1846 the duties on colonial fish entering our ports were very greatly reduced and by the warehousing act it is allowed to be entered in bond without payment of duty. In this way colonial fish has acquired the monopoly of the export trade in our market and is entering to some extent into the home consumption. These facts were among those which increased the sensibility of our fishing interest at the movement in question. These circumstances and the incents above alluded to have led me to think the moment favorable for a reconseration of the entire subject of the fisheries on the coasts of the British Provinces with a  to place them upon a more liberal footing of reciprocal privilege. A willingness to meet us in some arrangement of this kind is understood to exist on the part of Great Britain with a desire on her part to include in one comprehensive settlement as well this subject as the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British Provinces. I have thought that whatever arrangements may be made on these two subjects it is expedient that they should be embraced in separate conventions. The illness and death of the late Secretary of State prevented the commencement of the cond negotiation. Pains have been taken to collect the information required for the details of such an arrangement. The subject is attended with conserable difficulty. If it is found practicable to come to an agreement mutually acceptable to the two parties conventions may be concluded in the course of the present winter. The control of Congress over all the provisions of such an arrangement affecting the revenue will of course be reserved.< The affairs of Cuba formed a prominent topic in my last annual message. They remain in an uneasy condition and a feeling of alarm and irritation on the part of the Cuban authorities appears to exist. This feeling has interfered with the regular commercial intercourse between the United States and the island and led to some acts of which we have a fight to complain. But the CaptainGeneral of Cuba is clothed with no power to treat with foreign governments nor is he in any degree under the control of the Spanish minister at Washington. Any communication which he may hold with an agent of a foreign power is informal and matter of courtesy. Anxious to put an end to the existing inconveniences (which seemed to rest on a misconception) I directed the newly appointed minister to Mexico to visit Havana on his way to Vera Cruz. was respectfully received by the CaptainGeneral who conferred with him freely on the recent occurrences but no permanent arrangement was effected.< In the meantime the refusal of the CaptainGeneralto allow passengers and the mail to be landed in certain cases for a reason which does not furnish in the opinion of this Government even a good presumptive ground for such prohibition has been made the subject of a serious remonstrance at Madr and I have no reason to doubt that due respect will be pa by the Government of Her Catholic Majesty to the representations which our minister has been instructed to make on the subject.< It is but justice to the CaptainGeneral to add that his conduct toward the steamers employed to carry the mails of the United States to Havana has with the exceptions above alluded to been marked with kindness and liberality and indicates no general purpose of interfering with the commercial correspondence and intercourse between the island and this country.< Early in the present year official notes were received from the ministers of France and England inviting the Government of the United States to become a party with Great Britain and France to a tripartite convention in virtue of which the three powers should severally and collectively disclaim now and for the future all intention to obtain possession of the island of Cuba and should bind themselves to discountenance all attempts to that effect on the part of any power or inual whatever. This invitation has been respectfully declined for reasons which it would occupy too much space in this communication to state in detail but which led me to think that the proposed measure would be of doubtful constitutionality impolitic and uailing. I have however in common with several of my predecessors directed the ministers of France and England to be assured that the United States entertain no designs against Cuba but that on the contrary I should regard its incorporation into the Union at the present time as fraught with serious peril.< Were this island comparatively destitute of inhabitants or occupied by a kindred race I should regard it if voluntarily ceded by Spain as a most desirable acquisition. But under existing circumstances I should look upon its incorporation into our Union as a very hazardous measure. It would bring into the Confederacy a population of a different national stock speaking a different language and not likely to harmonize with the other members. It would probably affect in a prejudicial manner the industrial interests of the South and it might revive those conflicts of opinion between the different sections of the country which lately shook the Union to its center and which have been so happily compromised.< The rejection by the Mexican Congress of the convention which had been concluded between that Republic and the United States for the protection of a transit way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and of the interests of those citizens of the United States who had become proprietors of the rights which Mexico had conferred on one of her own citizens in regard to that transit has thrown a serious obstacle in the way of the attainment of a very desirable national object. I am still willing to hope that the differences on the subject which exist or may hereafter arise between the Governments will be amicably adjusted. This subject however has already engaged the attention of the Senate of the United States and requires no further comment in this communication.< The settlement of the question respecting the port of San Juan de Nicaragua and of the controversy between the Republics of Costa Rica and Nicaragua in regard to their boundaries was consered indispensable to the commencement of the ship canal between the two oceans which was the subject of the convention between the United States and Great Britain of the 19th of April 1850. Accordingly a proposition for the same purposes addressed to the two Governments in that quarter and to the Mosquito Indians was agreed to in April last by the Secretary of State and the minister of Her Britannic Majesty. Beses the wish to a in reconciling the differences of the two Republics I engaged in the negotiation from a desire to place the great work of a ship canal between the two oceans under one jurisdiction and to establish the important port of San Juan de Nicaragua under the government of a civilized power. The proposition in question was assented to by Costs Rica and the Mosquito Indians. It has not proved equally acceptable to Nicaragua but it is to be hoped that the further negotiations on the subject which are in train will be carried on in that spirit of conciliation and compromise which ought always to prevail on such occasions and that they will lead to a satisfactory result.< I have the satisfaction to inform you that the executive government of Venezuela has acknowledged some claims of citizens of the United States which have for many years past been urged by our charge' d'affaires at Caracas. It is hoped that the same sense of justice will actuate the Congress of that Republic in proving the means for their payment.< The recent revolution in Buenos Ayres and the Confederated States having opened the prospect of an improved state of things in that quarter the Governments of Great Britain and France determined to negotiate with the chief of the new confederacy for the free access of their commerce to the extensive countries watered by the tributaries of the La Plata; and they gave a friendly notice of this purpose to the United States that we might if we thought proper pursue the same course. In compliance with this invitation our minister at Rio Janeiro and our charge' d'affaires at Buenos Ayres have been fully authorized to conclude treaties with the newly organized confederation or the States composing it. The delays which have taken place in the formation of the new government have as yet prevented the execution of those instructions but there is every reason to hope that these vast countries will be eventually opened to our commerce.< A treaty of commerce has been concluded between the United States and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay which will be la before the Senate. Should this convention go into operation it will open to the commercial enterprise of our citizens a country of great extent and unsurpassed in natural resources but from which foreign nations have hitherto been almost wholly excluded.< The correspondence of the late Secretary of State with the Peruvian charge' d'affaires relative to the Lobos Islands was communicated to Congress toward the close of the last session. Since that time on further investigation of the subject the doubts which had been entertained of the title of Peru to those islands have been removed and I have deemed it just that the temporary wrong which had been unintentionally done her from want of information should be repaired by an unreserved acknowledgment of her sovereignty.< I have the satisfaction to inform you that the course pursued by Peru has been creditable to the liberality of her Government. Before it was known by her that her title would be acknowledged at Washington her minister of foreign affairs had authorized our charge' d'affaires at Lima to announce to the American vessels which had gone to the Lobos for guano that the Peruvian Government was willing to freight them on its own account. This intention has been carried into effect by the Peruvian minister here by an arrangement which is believed to be advantageous to the parties in interest.< Our settlements on the shores of the Pacific have already given a great extension and in some respects a new direction to our commerce in that ocean. A direct and raply increasing intercourse has sprung up with eastern Asia. The waters of the Northern Pacific even into the Arctic Sea have of late years been frequented by our whalemen. The application of steam to the general purposes of igation is becoming daily more common and makes it desirable to obtain fuel and other necessary supplies at convenient points on the route between Asia and our Pacific shores. Our unfortunate countrymen who from time to time suffer shipwreck on the coasts of the eastern seas are entitled to protection. Beses these specific objects the general prosperity of our States on the Pacific requires that an attempt should be made to open the opposite regions of Asia to a mutually beneficial intercourse. It is obvious that this attempt could be made by no power to so great advantage as by the United States whose constitutional system excludes every ea of distant colonial dependencies. I have accordingly been led to order an appropriate al force to Japan under the command of a discreet and intelligent officer of the highest rank known to our service. is instructed to endeavor to obtain from the Government of that country some relaxation of the inhospitable and antisocial system which it has pursued for about two centuries. has been directed particularly to remonstrate in the strongest language against the cruel treatment to which our shipwrecked mariners have often been subjected and to insist that they shall be treated with humanity. is instructed however at the same time to give that Government the amplest assurances that the objects of the United States are such and such only as I have indicated and that the expedition is friendly and peaceful. Notwithstanding the jealousy with which the Governments of eastern Asia regard all overtures from foreigners I am not without hopes of a beneficial result of the expedition. Should it be crowned with success the advantages will not be confined to the United States but as in the case of China will be equally enjoyed by all the other maritime powers. I have much satisfaction in stating that in all the steps preparatory to this expedition the Government of the United States has been materially aed by the good offices of the King of the Netherlands the only European power having any commercial relations with Japan.< In passing from this survey of our foreign relations I invite the attention of Congress to the condition of that Department of the Government to which this branch of the public business is intrusted. Our intercourse with foreign powers has of late years greatly increased both in consequence of our own growth and the introduction of many new states into the family of nations. In this way the Department of State has become overburdened. It has by the recent establishment of the Department of the Interior been relieved of some portion of the domestic business. If the resue of the business of that kindsuch as the distribution of Congressional documents the keeping publishing and distribution of the laws of the United States the execution of the copyright law the subject of reprieves and pardons and some other subjects relating to interior administrationshould be transferred from the Department of State it would unquestionably be for the benefit of the public service. I would also suggest that the building appropriated to the State Department is not fireproof; that there is reason to think there are defects in its construction and that the archives of the Government in charge of the Department with the precious collections of the manuscript papers of Washington Jefferson Hamilton Madison and Monroe are exposed to destruction by fire. A similar remark may be made of the buildings appropriated to the War and Navy Departments.< The condition of the Treasury is exhibited in the annual report from that Department.< The cash receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending the 30th June last exclusive of trust funds were $49728386.89 and the expenditures for the same period likewise exclusive of trust funds were $46007896.20 of which $9455815.83 was on account of the principal and interest of the public debt including the last installment of the indemnity to Mexico under the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo leaving a balance of $14632136.37 in the Treasury on the 1st day of July last. Since this latter period further purchases of the principal of the public debt have been made to the extent of $2456547.49 and the surplus in the Treasury will continue to be applied to that object whenever the stock can be procured within the limits as to price authorized by law.< The value of foreign merchandise imported during the last fiscal year was $207240101 and the value of domestic productions exported was $149861911 beses $17204026 of foreign merchandise exported making the aggregate of the entire exports $167065937. Exclusive of the above there was exported $42507285 in specie and imported from foreign ports $5262643.< In my first annual message to Congress I called your attention to what seemed to me some defects in the present tariff and recommended such modifications as in my judgment were best adapted to remedy its evils and promote the prosperity of the country. Nothing has since occurred to change my s on this important question.< Without repeating the arguments contained in my former message in favor of discriminating protective duties I deem it my duty to call your attention to one or two other conserations affecting this subject. The first is the effect of large importations of foreign goods upon our currency. Most of the gold of California as fast as it is coined finds its way directly to Europe in payment for goods purchased. In the second place as our manufacturing establishments are broken down by competition with foreigners the capital invested in them is lost thousands of honest and industrious citizens are thrown out of employment and the farmer to that extent is deprived of a home market for the sale of his surplus produce. In the third place the destruction of our manufactures leaves the foreigner without competition in our market and he consequently raises the price of the article sent here for sale as is now seen in the increased cost of iron imported from England. The prosperity and wealth of every nation must depend upon its productive industry. The farmer is stimulated to exertion by finding a ready market for his surplus products and benefited by being able to exchange them without loss of time or expense of transportation for the manufactures which his comfort or convenience requires. This is always done to the best advantage where a portion of the community in which he lives is engaged in other pursuits. But most manufactures require an amount of capital and a practical skill which can not be commanded unless they be protected for a time from ruinous competition from abroad. Hence the necessity of laying those duties upon imported goods which the Constitution authorizes for revenue in such a manner as to protect and encourage the labor of our own citizens. Duties however should not be fixed at a rate so high as to exclude the foreign article but should be so graduated as to enable the domestic manufacturer fairly to compete with the foreigner in our own markets and by this competition to reduce the price of the manufactured article to the consumer to the lowest rate at which it can be produced. This policy would place the mechanic by the se of the farmer create a mutual interchange of their respective commodities and thus stimulate the industry of the whole country and render us independent of foreign nations for the supplies required by the habits or necessities of the people.< Another question wholly independent of protection presents itself and that is whether the duties levied should be upon the value of the article at the place of shipment or where it is practicable a specific duty graduated according to quantity as ascertained by weight or measure. All our duties are at present ad valorem. A certain percentage is levied on the price of the goods at the port of shipment in a foreign country. Most commercial nations have found it indispensable for the purpose of preventing fraud and perjury to make the duties specific whenever the article is of such a uniform value in weight or measure as to justify such a duty. Legislation should never encourage dishonesty or crime. It is impossible that the revenue officers at the port where the goods are entered and the duties pa should know with certainty what they cost in the foreign country. Yet the law requires that they should levy the duty according to such cost. They are therefore compelled to resort to very unsatisfactory evence to ascertain what that cost was. They take the invoice of the importer attested by his oath as the best evence of which the nature of the case admits. But everyone must see that the invoice may be fabricated and the oath by which it is supported false by reason of which the dishonest importer pays a part only of the duties which are pa by the honest one and thus indirectly receives from the Treasury of the United States a reward for his fraud and perjury. The reports of the Secretary of the Treasury heretofore made on this subject show conclusively that these frauds have been practiced to a great extent. The tendency is to destroy that high moral character for which our merchants have long been distinguished to defraud the Government of its revenue to break down the honest importer by a dishonest competition and finally to transfer the business of importation to foreign and irresponsible agents to the great detriment of our own citizens. I therefore again most earnestly recommend the adoption of specific duties wherever it is practicable or a home valuation to prevent these frauds.< I would also again call your attention to the fact that the present tariff in some cases imposes a higher duty upon the raw material imported than upon the article manufactured from it the consequence of which is that the duty operates to the encouragement of the foreigner and the discouragement of our own citizens.< For full and detailed information in regard to the general condition of our Indian affairs I respectfully refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior and the accompanying documents.< The Senate not having thought proper to ratify the treaties which have been negotiated with the tribes of Indians in California and Oregon our relations with them have been left in a very unsatisfactory condition.< In other parts of our territory particular districts of country have been set apart for the exclusive occupation of the Indians and their right to the lands within those limits has been acknowledged and respected. But in California and Oregon there has been no recognition by the Government of the exclusive right of the Indians to any part of the country. They are therefore mere tenants at sufferance and liable to be driven from place to place at the pleasure of the whites.< The treaties which have been rejected proposed to remedy this evil by allotting to the different tribes districts of country suitable to their habits of life and sufficient for their support. This provision more than any other it is believed led to their rejection; and as no substitute for it has been adopted by Congress it has not been deemed advisable to attempt to enter into new treaties of a permanent character although no effort has been spared by temporary arrangements to preserve friendly relations with them.< If it be the desire of Congress to remove them from the country altogether or to assign to them particular districts more remote from the settlements of the whites it will be proper to set apart by law the territory which they are to occupy and to prove the means necessary for removing them to it. Justice alike to our own citizens and to the Indians requires the prompt action of Congress on this subject. The amendments proposed by the Senate to the treaties which were negotiated with the Sioux Indians of Minnesota have been submitted to the tribes who were parties to them and have received their assent. A large tract of valuable territory has thus been opened for settlement and cultivation and all danger of collision with these powerful and warlike bands has been happily removed.< The removal of the remnant of the tribe of Seminole Indians from Flora has long been a cherished object of the Government and it is one to which my attention has been steadily directed. Admonished by past experience of the difficulty and cost of the attempt to remove them by military force resort has been had to conciliatory measures. By the invitation of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs several of the principal chiefs recently visited Washington and whilst here acknowledged in writing the obligation of their tribe to remove with the least possible delay. Late advices from the special agent of the Government represent that they adhere to their promise and that a council of their people has been called to make their preliminary arrangements. A general emigration may therefore be confently expected at an early day.< The report from the General Land Office shows increased activity in its operations. The survey of the northern boundary of Iowa has been completed with unexampled dispatch. Within the last year 9522953 acres of public land have been surveyed and 8032463 acres brought into market.< Acres In the last fiscal year there were sold 1553071 Located with bountyland warrants 3201314 Located with other certificates 115682 Making a total of 4870067< In addition there were Reported under swampland grants 5219188 For internal improvements railroads etc 3025920 Making an aggregate of 13115175 Being an increase of the amount sold and located under land warrants of 569220 acres over the previous year. The whole amount thus sold located under land warrants reported under swampland grants and selected for internal improvements exceeds that of the previous year by 3342372 acres; and the sales would without doubt have been much larger but for the extensive reservations for railroads in Missouri Mississippi and Alabama.< Acres For the quarter ending 30th September 1852 there were sold 243255 Located with bountyland warrants 1387116 Located with other certificates 15649 Reported under swampland grants 2485233 Making an aggregate for the quarter of 4131253< Much the larger portion of the labor of arranging and ifying the returns of the last census has been finished and it will now devolve upon Congress to make the necessary provision for the publication of the results in such form as shall be deemed best. The apportionment of representation on the basis of the new census has been made by the Secretary of the Interior in conformity with the provisions of law relating to that subject and the recent elections have been made in accordance with it.< I commend to your favorable regard the suggestion contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior that provision be made by law for the publication and distribution periodically of an analytical digest of all the patents which have been or may hereafter be granted for useful inventions and discoveries with such descriptions and illustrations as may be necessary to present an intelligible  of their nature and operation. The cost of such publication could easily be defrayed out of the patent fund and I am persuaded that it could be applied to no object more acceptable to inventors and beneficial to the public at large.< An appropriation of $100000 having been made at the last session for the purchase of a suitable site and for the erection furnishing and fitting up of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and of the Army and Navy of the United States the proper measures have been adopted to carry this beneficent purpose into effect.< By the latest advices from the Mexican boundary commission it appears that the survey of the river Gila from its continence with the Colorado to its supposed intersection with the western line of New Mexico has been completed. The survey of the Rio Grande has also been finished from the point agreed on by the commissioners as the point where it strikes the southern boundary of New Mexico to a point 135 miles below Eagle Pass which is about twothirds of the distance along the course of the river to its mouth.< The appropriation which was made at the last session of Congress for the continuation of the survey is subject to the following proviso: Proved That no part of this appropriation shall be used or expended until it shall be made satisfactorily to appear to the Present of the United States that the southern boundary of New Mexico is not established by the commissioner and surveyor of the United States farther north of the town called Paso than the same is la down in Disturnell's map which is added to the treaty.< My attention was drawn to this subject by a report from the Department of the Interior which reed all the facts of the case and submitted for my decision the question whether under existing circumstances any part of the appropriation could be lawfully used or expended for the further prosecution of the work. After a careful conseration of the subject I came to the conclusion that it could not and so informed the head of that Department. Orders were immediately issued by him to the commissioner and surveyor to make no further requisitions on the Department as they could not be pa and to discontinue all operations on the southern line of New Mexico. But as the Department had no exact information as to the amount of provisions and money which remained unexpended in the hands of the commissioner and surveyor it was left discretionary with them to continue the survey down the Rio Grande as far as the means at their disposal would enable them or at once to disband the commission. A special messenger has since arrived from the officer in charge of the survey on the river with information that the funds subject to his control were exhausted and that the officers and others employed in the service were destitute alike of the means of prosecuting the work and of returning to their homes.< The object of the proviso was doubtless to arrest the survey of the southern and western lines of New Mexico in regard to which different opinions have been expressed; for it is hardly to be supposed that there could be any objection to that part of the line which extends along the channel of the Rio Grande. But the terms of the law are so broad as to forb the use of any part of the money for the prosecution of the work or even for the payment to the officers and agents of the arrearages of pay which are justly due to them.< I earnestly invite your prompt attention to this subject and recommend a modification of the terms of the proviso so as to enable the Department to use as much of the appropriation as will be necessary to discharge the existing obligations of the Government and to complete the survey of the Rio Grande to its mouth.< It will also be proper to make further provision by law for the fulfillment of our treaty with Mexico for running and marking the resue of the boundary line between the two countries.< Permit me to invite your particular attention to the interests of the Distric
 of Columbia which are confed by the Constitution to your peculiar care.< Among the measures which seem to me of the greatest importance to its prosperity are the introduction of a copious supply of water into the city of Washington and the construction of suitable brges across the Potomac to replace those which were destroyed by high water in the early part of the present year.< At the last session of Congress an appropriation was made to defray the cost of the surveys necessary for determining the best means of affording an unfailing supply of good and wholesome water. Some progress has been made in the survey and as soon as it is completed the result will be la before you.< Further appropriations will also be necessary for grading and paving the streets and avenues and inclosing and embellishing the public grounds within the city of Washington.< I commend all these objects together with the charitable institutions of the District to your favorable regard. Every effort has been made to protect our frontier and that of the adjoining Mexican States from the incursions of the Indian tribes. Of about 11000 men of which the Army is composed nearly 8000 are employed in the defense of the newly acquired territory (including Texas) and of emigrants proceeding thereto. I am gratified to say that these efforts have been unusually successful. With the exception of some partial outbreaks in California and Oregon and occasional depredations on a portion of the Rio Grande owing it is believed to the disturbed state of that border region the inroads of the Indians have been effectually restrained.< Experience has shown however that whenever the two races are brought into contact collisions will inevitably occur. To prevent these collisions the United States have generally set apart portions of their territory for the exclusive occupation of the Indian tribes. A difficulty occurs however in the application of this policy to Texas. By the terms of the compact by which that State was admitted into the Union she retained the ownership of all the vacant lands within her limits. The government of that State it is understood has assigned no portion of her territory to the Indians but as fast as her settlements advance lays it off into counties and proceeds to survey and sell it. This policy manifestly tends not only to alarm and irritate the Indians but to compel them to resort to plunder for subsistence. It also deprives this Government of that influence and control over them without which no durable peace can ever exist between them and the whites. I trust therefore that a due regard for her own interests apart from conserations of humanity and justice will induce that State to assign a small portion of her vast domain for the provisional occupancy of the small remnants of tribes within her borders subject of course to her ownership and eventual jurisdiction. If she should fail to do this the fulfillment of our treaty stipulations with Mexico and our duty to the Indians themselves will it is feared become a subject of serious embarrassment to the Government. It is hoped however that a timely and just provision by Texas may avert this evil.< No appropriations for fortifications were made at the two last sessions of Congress. The cause of this omission is probably to be found in a growing belief that the system of fortifications adopted in 1816 and heretofore acted on requires revision.< The subject certainly deserves full and careful investigation but it should not be delayed longer than can be avoed. In the meantime there are certain works which have been commenced some of them nearly completed designed to protect our principal seaports from Boston to New Orleans and a few other important points. In regard to the necessity for these works it is believed that little difference of opinion exists among military men. I therefore recommend that the appropriations necessary to prosecute them be made.< I invite your attention to the remarks on this subject and on others connected with his Department contained in the accompanying report of the Secretary of War.< Measures have been taken to carry into effect the law of the last session making provision for the improvement of certain rivers and harbors and it is believed that the arrangements made for that purpose will combine efficiency with economy. Owing chiefly to the advanced season when the act was passed little has yet been done in regard to many of the works beyond making the necessary preparations. With respect to a few of the improvements the sums already appropriated will suffice to complete them; but most of them will require additional appropriations. I trust that these appropriations will be made and that this wise and beneficent policy so auspiciously resumed will be continued. Great care should be taken however to commence no work which is not of sufficient importance to the commerce of the country to be ed as national in its character. But works which have been commenced should not be discontinued until completed as otherwise the sums expended will in most cases be lost.< The report from the Navy Department will inform you of the prosperous condition of the branch of the public service committed to its charge. It presents to your conseration many topics and suggestions of which I ask your approval. It exhibits an unusual degree of activity in the operations of the Department during the past year. The preparations for the Japan expedition to which I have already alluded; the arrangements made for the exploration and survey of the China Seas the Northern Pacific and Behrings Straits; the incipient measures taken toward a reconnoissance of the continent of Africa eastward of Liberia; the preparation for an early examination of the tributaries of the river La Plata which a recent decree of the provisional chief of the Argentine Confederation has opened to igationall these enterprises and the means by which they are proposed to be accomplished have commanded my full approbation and I have no doubt will be productive of most useful results.< Two officers of the Navy were heretofore instructed to explore the whole extent of the Amazon River from the confines of Peru to its mouth. The return of one of them has placed in the possession of the Government an interesting and valuable account of the character and resources of a country abounding in the materials of commerce and which if opened to the industry of the world will prove an inexhaustible fund of wealth. The report of this exploration will be communicated to you as soon as it is completed.< Among other subjects offered to your notice by the Secretary of the Navy I select for special commendation in  of its connection with the interests of the Navy the plan submitted by him for the establishment of a permanent corps of seamen and the suggestions he has presented for the reorganization of the Naval Academy.< In reference to the first of these I take occasion to say that I think it will greatly improve the efficiency of the service and that I regard it as still more entitled to favor for the salutary influence it must exert upon the al discipline now greatly disturbed by the increasing spirit of insubordination resulting from our present system. The plan proposed for the organization of the seamen furnishes a judicious substitute for the law of September 1850 abolishing corporal punishment and satisfactorily sustains the policy of that act under conditions well adapted to maintain the authority of command and the order and security of our ships. It is believed that any change which proposes permanently to dispense with this mode of punishment should be preceded by a system of enlistment which shall supply the Navy with seamen of the most meritorious  whose good deportment and pre of character may preclude all occasion for a resort to penalties of a harsh or degrading nature. The safety of a ship and her crew is often dependent upon immediate obedience to a command and the authority to enforce it must be equally ready. The arrest of a refractory seaman in such moments not only deprives the ship of indispensable a but imposes a necessity for double service on others whose felity to their duties may be relied upon in such an emergency. The exposure to this increased and arduous labor since the passage of the act of 1850 has already had to a most observable and injurious extent the effect of preventing the enlistment of the best seamen in the Navy. The plan now suggested is designed to promote a condition of service in which this objection will no longer exist. The details of this plan may be established in great part if not altogether by the Executive under the authority of existing laws but I have thought it proper in accordance with the suggestion of the Secretary of the Navy to submit it to your approval.< The establishment of a corps of apprentices for the Navy or boys to be enlisted until they become of age and to be employed under such regulations as the Navy Department may devise as proposed in the report I cordially approve and commend to your conseration; and I also concur in the suggestion that this system for the early training of seamen may be most usefully ingrafted upon the service of our merchant marine. The other proposition of the report to which I have referredthe reorganization of the Naval AcademyI recommend to your attention as a project worthy of your encouragement and support. The valuable services already rendered by this institution entitle it to the continuance of your fostering care.< Your attention is respectfully called to the report of the Postmaster General for the detailed operation of his Department during the last fiscal year from which it will be seen that the receipts from postages for that time were less by $1431696 than for the preceding fiscal year being a decrease of about 23 per cent.< This diminution is attributable to the reduction in the rates of postage made by the act of March 3 1851 which reduction took effect at the commencement of the last fiscal year.< Although in its operation during the last year the act referred to has not fulfilled the predictions of its friends by increasing the correspondence of the country in proportion to the reduction of postage I should nevertheless question the policy of returning to higher rates. Experience warrants the expectation that as the community becomes accustomed to cheap postage correspondence will increase. It is believed that from this cause and from the rap growth of the country in population and business the receipts of the Department must ultimately exceed its expenses and that the country may safely rely upon the continuance of the present cheap rate of postage.< In former messages I have among other things respectfully recommended to the conseration of Congress the propriety and necessity of further legislation for the protection and punishment of foreign consuls resing in the United States; to revive with certain modifications the act of 10th March 1838 to restrain unlawful military expeditions against the inhabitants of conterminous states or territories; for the preservation and protection from mutilation or theft of the papers records and archives of the nation; for authorizing the surplus revenue to be applied to the payment of the public debt in advance of the time when it will become due; for the establishment of land offices for the sale of the public lands in California and the Territory of Oregon; for the construction of a road from the Mississippi Valley to the Pacific Ocean; for the establishment of a bureau of agriculture for the promotion of that interest perhaps the most important in the country; for the prevention of frauds upon the Government in applications for pensions and bounty lands; for the establishment of a uniform fee bill prescribing a specific compensation for every service required of clerks district attorneys and marshals; for authorizing an additional regiment of mounted men for the defense of our frontiers against the Indians and for fulfilling our treaty stipulations with Mexico to defend her citizens against the Indians with equal diligence and energy as our own; for determining the relative rank between the al and civil officers in our public ships and between the officers of the Army and Navy in the various grades of each; for reorganizing the al establishment by fixing the number of officers in each grade and proving for a retired list upon reduced pay of those unfit for active duty; for prescribing and regulating punishments in the Navy; for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statutes of the United States by arranging them in order supplying deficiencies correcting incongruities simplifying their language and reporting them to Congress for its final action; and for the establishment of a commission to adjudicate and settle private claims against the United States. I am not aware however that any of these subjects have been finally acted upon by Congress. Without repeating the reasons for legislation on these subjects which have been assigned in former messages I respectfully recommend them again to your favorable conseration.< I think it due to the several Executive Departments of this Government to bear testimony to the efficiency and integrity with which they are conducted. With all the careful superintendence which it is possible for the heads of those Departments to exercise still the due administration and guardianship of the public money must very much depend on the vigilance intelligence and felity of the subordinate officers and clerks and especially on those intrusted with the settlement and adjustment of claims and accounts. I am gratified to believe that they have generally performed their duties faithfully and well. They are appointed to guard the approaches to the public Treasury and they occupy positions that expose them to all the temptations and seductions which the cupity of peculators and fraudulent claimants can prompt them to employ. It will be but a wise precaution to protect the Government against that source of mischief and corruption as far as it can be done by the enactment of all proper legal penalties. The laws in this respect are supposed to be defective and I therefore deem it my duty to call your attention to the subject and to recommend that provision be made by law for the punishment not only of those who shall accept bribes but also of those who shall either promise give or offer to give to any of those officers or clerks a bribe or reward touching or relating to any matter of their official action or duty.< It has been the uniform policy of this Government from its foundation to the present day to abstain from all interference in the domestic affairs of other nations. The consequence has been that while the nations of Europe have been engaged in desolating wars our country has pursued its peaceful course to unexampled prosperity and happiness. The wars in which we have been compelled to engage in defense of the rights and honor of the country have been fortunately of short duration. During the terrific contest of nation against nation which succeeded the French Revolution we were enabled by the wisdom and firmness of Present Washington to maintain our neutrality. While other nations were drawn into this wesweeping whirlpool we sat quiet and unmoved upon our own shores. While the flower of their numerous armies was wasted by disease or perished by hundreds of thousands upon the battlefield the youth of this favored land were permitted to enjoy the blessings of peace beneath the paternal roof. While the States of Europe incurred enormous debts under the burden of which their subjects still groan and which must absorb no small part of the product of the honest industry of those countries for generations to come the United States have once been enabled to exhibit the proud spectacle of a nation free from public debt and if permitted to pursue our prosperous way for a few years longer in peace we may do the same again.< But it is now sa by some that this policy must be changed. Europe is no longer separated from us by a voyage of months but steam igation has brought her within a few days' sail of our shores. We see more of her movements and take a deeper interest in her controversies. Although no one proposes that we should join the fraternity of potentates who have for ages lavished the blood and treasure of their subjects in maintaining the balance of power yet it is sa that we ought to interfere between contending sovereigns and their subjects for the purpose of overthrowing the monarchies of Europe and establishing in their place republican institutions. It is alleged that we have heretofore pursued a different course from a sense of our weakness but that now our conscious strength dictates a change of policy and that it is consequently our duty to mingle in these contests and a those who are struggling for liberty.< This is a most seductive but dangerous appeal to the generous sympathies of freemen. Enjoying as we do the blessings of a free Government there is no man who has an American heart that would not rejoice to see these blessings extended to all other nations. We can not witness the struggle between the oppressed and his oppressor anywhere without the deepest sympathy for the former and the most anxious desire for his triumph. Nevertheless is it prudent or is it wise to involve ourselves in these foreign wars? Is it indeed true that we have heretofore refrained from doing so merely from the degrading motive of a conscious weakness? For the honor of the patriots who have gone before us I can not admit it. Men of the Revolution who drew the sword against the oppressions of the mother country and pledged to Heaven their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to maintain their freedom could never have been actuated by so unworthy a motive. They knew no weakness or fear where right or duty pointed the way and it is a libel upon their fair fame for us while we enjoy the blessings for which they so nobly fought and bled to insinuate it. The truth is that the course which they pursued was dictated by a stern sense of international justice by a statesmanlike prudence and a farseeing wisdom looking not merely to the present necessities but to the permanent safety and interest of the country. They knew that the world is governed less by sympathy than by reason and force; that it was not possible for this nation to become a propagandist of free principles without arraying against it the combined powers of Europe and that the result was more likely to be the overthrow of republican liberty here than its establishment there. History has been written in vain for those who can doubt this. France had no sooner established a republican form of government than she manifested a desire to force its blessings on all the world. Her own historian informs us that hearing of some petty acts of tyranny in a neighboring principality the National Convention declared that she would afford succor and fraternity to all nations who wished to recover their liberty and she gave it in charge to the executive power to give orders to the generals of the French armies to a all citizens who might have been or should be oppressed in the cause of liberty. Here was the false step which led to her subsequent misfortunes. She soon found herself involved in war with all the rest of Europe. In less than ten years her Government was changed from a republic to an empire and finally after shedding rivers of blood foreign powers restored her exiled dynasty and exhausted Europe sought peace and repose in the unquestioned ascendency of monarchical principles. Let us learn wisdom from her example. Let us remember that revolutions do not always establish freedom. Our own free institutions were not the offspring of our Revolution. They existed before. They were planted in the free charters of selfgovernment under which the English colonies grew up and our Revolution only freed us from the dominion of a foreign power whose government was at variance with those institutions. But European nations have had no such training for selfgovernment and every effort to establish it by bloody revolutions has been and must without that preparation continue to be a failure. Liberty unregulated by law degenerates into anarchy which soon becomes the most horr of all despotisms. Our policy is wisely to govern ourselves and thereby to set such an example of national justice prosperity and true glory as shall teach to all nations the blessings of selfgovernment and the unparalleled enterprise and success of a free people.< We live in an age of progress and ours is emphatically a country of progress. Within the last half century the number of States in this Union has nearly doubled the population has almost quadrupled and our boundaries have been extended from the Mississippi to the Pacific. Our territory is checkered over with railroads and furrowed with canals. The inventive talent of our country is excited to the highest pitch and the numerous applications for patents for valuable improvements distinguish this age and this people from all others. The genius of one American has enabled our commerce to move against wind and te and that of another has annihilated distance in the transmission of intelligence. The whole country is full of enterprise. Our common schools are diffusing intelligence among the people and our industry is fast accumulating the comforts and luxuries of life. This is in part owing to our peculiar position to our fertile soil and comparatively sparse population; but much of it is also owing to the popular institutions under which we live to the freedom which every man feels to engage in any useful pursuit according to his taste or inclination and to the entire confence that his person and property will be protected by the laws. But whatever may be the cause of this unparalleled growth in population intelligence and wealth one tiring is clearthat the Government must keep pace with the progress of the people. It must participate in their spirit of enterprise and while it exacts obedience to the laws and restrains all unauthorized invasions of the rights of neighboring states it should foster and protect home industry and lend its powerful strength to the improvement of such means of intercommunication as are necessary to promote our internal commerce and strengthen the ties which bind us together as a people.< It is not strange however much it may be regretted that such an exuberance of enterprise should cause some inuals to mistake change for progress and the invasion of the rights of others for national prowess and glory. The former are constantly agitating for some change in the organic law or urging new and untried theories of human rights. The latter are ever ready to engage in any wild crusade against a neighboring people regardless of the justice of the enterprise and without looking at the fatal consequences to ourselves and to the cause of popular government. Such expeditions however are often stimulated by mercenary inuals who expect to share the plunder or profit of the enterprise without exposing themselves to danger and are led on by some irresponsible foreigner who abuses the hospitality of our own Government by seducing the young and ignorant to join in his scheme of personal ambition or revenge under the false and delusive pretense of extending the area of freedom. These reprehensible aggressions but retard the true progress of our nation and tarnish its fair fame. They should therefore receive the indignant frowns of every good citizen who sincerely loves his country and takes a pre in its prosperity and honor. Our Constitution though not perfect is doubtless the best that ever was formed. Therefore let every proposition to change it be well weighed and if found beneficial cautiously adopted. Every patriot will rejoice to see its authority so exerted as to advance the prosperity and honor of the nation whilst he will watch with jealousy any attempt to mutilate this charter of our liberties or pervert its powers to acts of aggression or injustice. Thus shall conservatism and progress blend their harmonious action in preserving the form and spirit of the Constitution and at the same time carry forward the great improvements of the country with a rapity and energy which freemen only can display.< In closing this my last annual communication permit me fellowcitizens to congratulate you on the prosperous condition of our beloved country. Abroad its relations with all foreign powers are friendly its rights are respected and its high place in the family of nations cheerfully recognized. At home we enjoy an amount of happiness public and private which has probably never fallen to the lot of any other people. Beses affording to our own citizens a degree of prosperity of which on so large a scale I know of no other instance our country is annually affording a refuge and a home to multitudes altogether without example from the Old World.< We owe these blessings under Heaven to the happy Constitution and Government which were bequeathed to us by our fathers and which it is our sacred duty to transmit in all their integrity to our children. We must all conser it a great distinction and privilege to have been chosen by the people to bear a part in the administration of such a Government. Called by an unexpected dispensation to its highest trust at a season of embarrassment and alarm I entered upon its arduous duties with extreme diffence. I claim only to have discharged them to the best of an humble ability with a single eye to the public good and it is with devout gratitude in retiring from office that I leave the country in a state of peace and prosperity.< 
FellowCitizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:< Sixty years have elapsed since the establishment of this Government and the Congress of the United States again assembles to legislate for an empire of freemen. The predictions of evil prophets who formerly pretended to foretell the downfall of our institutions are now remembered only to be dered and the United States of America at this moment present to the world the most stable and permanent Government on earth.< Such is the result of the labors of those who have gone before us. Upon Congress will eminently depend the future maintenance of our system of free government and the transmission of it unimpaired to posterity.< We are at peace with all the other nations of the world and seek to maintain our cherished relations of amity with them. During the past year we have been blessed by a kind Provence with an abundance of the fruits of the earth and although the destroying angel for a time visited extensive portions of our territory with the ravages of a dreadful pestilence yet the Almighty has at length deigned to stay his hand and to restore the inestimable blessing of general health to a people who have acknowledged His power deprecated His wrath and implored His merciful protection.< While enjoying the benefits of amicable intercourse with foreign nations we have not been insensible to the distractions and wars which have prevailed in other quarters of the world. It is a proper theme of thanksgiving to Him who rules the destinies of nations that we have been able to maintain amst all these contests an independent and neutral position toward all belligerent powers.< Our relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character. In consequence of the recent alteration of the British igation acts British vessels from British and other foreign ports will under our existing laws after the 1st day of January next be admitted to entry in our ports with cargoes of the growth manufacture or production of any part of the world on the same terms as to duties imposts and charges as vessels of the United States with their cargoes and our vessels will be admitted to the same advantages in British ports entering therein on the same terms as British vessels. Should no order in council disturb this legislative arrangement the late act of the British Parliament by which Great Britain is brought within the terms proposed by the act of Congress of the 1st of March 1817 it is hoped will be productive of benefit to both countries.< A slight interruption of diplomatic intercourse which occurred between this Government and France I am happy to say has been terminated and our minister there has been received. It is therefore unnecessary to refer now to the circumstances which led to that interruption. I need not express to you the sincere satisfaction with which we shall welcome the arrival of another envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from a sister Republic to which we have so long been and still remain bound by the strongest ties of amity.< Shortly after I had entered upon the discharge of the Executive duties I was apprised that a war steamer belonging to the German Empire was being fitted out in the harbor of New York with the a of some of our al officers rendered under the permission of the late Secretary of the Navy. This permission was granted during an armistice between that Empire and the Kingdom of Denmark which had been engaged in the SchleswigHolstein war. Apprehensive that this act of intervention on our part might be ed as a violation of our neutral obligations incurred by the treaty with Denmark and of the provisions of the act of Congress of the 20th of April 1818 I directed that no further a should be rendered by any agent or officer of the Navy; and I instructed the Secretary of State to apprise the minister of the German Empire accredited to this Government of my determination to execute the law of the United States and to maintain the faith of treaties with all nations. The correspondence which ensued between the Department of State and the minister of the German Empire is herewith la before you. The execution of the law and the observance of the treaty were deemed by me to be due to the honor of the country as well as to the sacred obligations of the Constitution. I shall not fail to pursue the same course should a similar case arise with any other nation. Having avowed the opinion on taking the oath of office that in disputes between conflicting foreign governments it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral I shall not abandon it. You will perceive from the correspondence submitted to you in connection with this subject that the course adopted in this case has been properly regarded by the belligerent powers interested in the matter.< Although a minister of the United States to the German Empire was appointed by my predecessor in August 1848 and has for a long time been in attendance at FrankfortontheMain and although a minister appointed to represent that Empire was received and accredited here yet no such government as that of the German Empire has been definitively constituted. Mr. Donelson our representative at Frankfort remained there several months in the expectation that a union of the German States under one constitution or form of government might at length be organized. It is believed by those well acquainted with the existing relations between Prussia and the States of Germany that no such union can be permanently established without her cooperation. In the event of the formation of such a union and the organization of a central power in Germany of which she should form a part it would become necessary to withdraw our minister at Berlin; but while Prussia exists as an independent kingdom and diplomatic relations are maintained with her there can be no necessity for the continuance of the mission to Frankfort. I have therefore recalled Mr. Donelson and directed the archives of the legation at Frankfort to be transferred to the American legation at Berlin.< Having been apprised that a conserable number of adventurers were engaged in fitting out a military expedition within the United States against a foreign country and believing from the best information I could obtain that it was destined to invade the island of Cuba I deemed it due to the friendly relations existing between the United States and Spain to the treaty between the two nations to the laws of the United States and above all to the American honor to exert the lawful authority of this Government in suppressing the expedition and preventing the invasion. To this end I issued a proclamation enjoining it upon the officers of the United States civil and military to use all lawful means within their power. A copy of that proclamation is herewith submitted. The expedition has been suppressed. So long as the act of Congress of the 20th of April 1818 which owes its existence to the law of nations and to the policy of Washington himself shall remain on our statute books I hold it to be the duty of the Executive faithfully to obey its injunctions.< While this expedition was in progress I was informed that a foreigner who claimed our protection had been clandestinely and as was supposed forcibly carried off in a vessel from New Orleans to the island of Cuba. I immediately caused such steps to be taken as I thought necessary in case the information I had received should prove correct to vindicate the honor of the country and the right of every person seeking an asylum on our soil to the protection of our laws. The person alleged to have been abducted was promptly restored and the circumstances of the case are now about to undergo investigation before a judicial tribunal. I would respectfully suggest that although the crime charged to have been committed in this case is held odious as being in conflict with our opinions on the subject of national sovereignty and personal freedom there is no prohibition of it or punishment for it proved in any act of Congress. The expediency of supplying this defect in our criminal code is therefore recommended to your conseration.< I have scrupulously avoed any interference in the wars and contentions which have recently distracted Europe. During the late conflict between Austria and Hungary there seemed to be a prospect that the latter might become an independent nation. However faint that prospect at the time appeared I thought it my duty in accordance with the general sentiment of the American people who deeply sympathized with the Magyar patriots to stand prepared upon the contingency of the establishment by her of a permanent government to be the first to welcome independent Hungary into the family of nations. For this purpose I invested an agent then in Europe with power to declare our willingness promptly to recognize her independence in the event of her ability to sustain it. The powerful intervention of Russia in the contest extinguished the hopes of the struggling Magyars. The United States d not at any time interfere in the contest but the feelings of the nation were strongly enlisted in the cause and by the sufferings of a brave people who had made a gallant though unsuccessful effort to be free.< Our claims upon Portugal have been during the past year prosecuted with renewed vigor and it has been my object to employ every effort of honorable diplomacy to procure their adjustment. Our late charge d'affaires at Lisbon the Hon. George W. Hopkins made able and energetic but unsuccessful efforts to settle these unpleasant matters of controversy and to obtain indemnity for the wrongs which were the subjects of complaint. Our present charge' d'affaires at that Court will also bring to the prosecution of these claims ability and zeal. The revolutionary and distracted condition of Portugal in past times has been represented as one of the leading causes of her delay in indemnifying our suffering citizens. But I must now say it is matter of profound regret that these claims have not yet been settled. The omission of Portugal to do justice to the American claimants has now assumed a character so grave and serious that I shall shortly make it the subject of a special message to Congress with a  to such ultimate action as its wisdom and patriotism may suggest.< With Russia Austria Prussia Sweden Denmark Belgium the Netherlands and the Italian States we still maintain our accustomed amicable relations.< During the recent revolutions in the Papal States our charge d'affaires at Rome has been unable to present his letter of credence which indeed he was directed by my predecessor to withhold until he should receive further orders. Such was the unsettled condition of things in those States that it was not deemed expedient to give him any instructions on the subject of presenting his credential letter different from those with which he had been furnished by the late Administration until the 25th of June last when in consequence of the want of accurate information of the exact state of things at that distance from us he was instructed to exercise his own discretion in presenting himself to the then existing Government if in his judgment sufficiently stable or if not to await further events. Since that period Rome has undergone another revolution and he abes the establishment of a government sufficiently permanent to justify him in opening diplomatic intercourse with it.< With the Republic of Mexico it is our true policy to cultivate the most friendly relations. Since the ratification of the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo nothing has occurred of a serious character to disturb them. A faithful observance of the treaty and a sincere respect for her rights can not fail to secure the lasting confence and friendship of that Republic. The message of my predecessor to the House of Representatives of the 8th of February last communicating in compliance with a resolution of that body a copy of a paper called a protocol signed at Queretaro on the 30th of May 1848 by the commissioners of the United States and the minister of foreign affairs of the Mexican Government having been a subject of correspondence between the Department of State and the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that Republic accredited to this Government a  of that correspondence is herewith submitted.< The commissioner on the part of the United States for marking the boundary between the two Republics though delayed in reaching San Diego by unforeseen obstacles arrived at that place within a short period after the time required by the treaty and was there joined by the commissioner on the part of Mexico. They entered upon their duties and at the date of the latest intelligence from that quarter some progress had been made in the survey. The expenses incent to the organization of the commission and to its conveyance to the point where its operations were to begin have so much reduced the fund appropriated by Congress that a further sum to cover the charges which must be incurred during the present fiscal year will be necessary. The great length of frontier along which the boundary extends the nature of the adjacent territory and the difficulty of obtaining supplies except at or near the extremes of the line render it also indispensable that a liberal provision should be made to meet the necessary charges during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June 1851. I accordingly recommend this subject to your attention.< In the adjustment of the claims of American citizens on Mexico proved for by the late treaty the employment of counsel on the part of the Government may become important for the purpose of assisting the commissioners in protecting the interests of the United States. I recommend this subject to the early and favorable conseration of Congress.< Complaints have been made in regard to the inefficiency of the means proved by the Government of New Granada for transporting the United States mail across the Isthmus of Panama pursuant to our postal convention with that Republic of the 6th of March 1844. Our charge d'affaires at Bogota has been directed to make such representations to the Government of New Granada as will it is hoped lead to a prompt removal of this cause of complaint.< The sanguinary civil war with which the Republic of Venezuela has for some time past been ravaged has been brought to a close. In its progress the rights of some of our citizens resent or trading there have been violated. The restoration of order will afford the Venezuelan Government an opportunity to examine and redress these grievances and others of longer standing which our representatives at Caracas have hitherto ineffectually urged upon the attention of that Government.< The extension of the coast of the United States on the Pacific and the unexampled rapity with which the inhabitants of California especially are increasing in numbers have imparted new consequence to our relations with the other countries whose territories border upon that ocean. It is probable that the intercourse between those countries and our possessions in that quarter particularly with the Republic of Chili will become extensive and mutually advantageous in proportion as California and Oregon shall increase in population and wealth. It is desirable therefore that this Government should do everything in its power to foster and strengthen its relations with those States and that the spirit of amity between us should be mutual and cordial.< I recommend the observance of the same course toward all other American States. The United States stand as the great American power to which as their natural ally and friend they will always be disposed first to look for mediation and assistance in the event of any collision between them and any European nation. As such we may often kindly mediate in their behalf without entangling ourselves in foreign wars or unnecessary controversies. Whenever the faith of our treaties with any of them shall require our interference we must necessarily interpose.< A convention has been negotiated with Brazil proving for the satisfaction of American claims on that Government and it will be submitted to the Senate. Since the last session of Congress we have received an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from that Empire and our relations with it are rounded upon the most amicable understanding.< Your attention is earnestly invited to an amendment of our existing laws relating to the African slave trade with a  to the effectual suppression of that barbarous traffic. It is not to be denied that this trade is still in part carried on by means of vessels built in the United States and owned or igated by some of our citizens. The correspondence between the Department of State and the minister and consul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro which has from time to time been la before Congress represents that it is a customary device to evade the penalties of our laws by means of sea letters. Vessels sold in Brazil when proved with such papers by the consul instead of returning to the United States for a new register proceed at once to the coast of Africa for the purpose of obtaining cargoes of slaves. Much additional information of the same character has recently been transmitted to the Department of State. It has not been consered the policy of our laws to subject an American citizen who in a foreign country purchases a vessel built in the United States to the inconvenience of sending her home for a new register before permitting her to proceed on a voyage. Any alteration of the laws which might have a tendency to impede the free transfer of property in vessels between our citizens or the free igation of those vessels between different parts of the world when employed in lawful commerce should be well and cautiously consered; but I trust that your wisdom will devise a method by which our general policy in this respect may be preserved and at the same time the abuse of our flag by means of sea letters in the manner indicated may be prevented.< Having ascertained that there is no prospect of the reunion of the five States of Central America which formerly composed the Republic of that name we have separately negotiated with some of them treaties of amity and commerce which will be la before the Senate.< A contract having been concluded with the State of Nicaragua by a company composed of American citizens for the purpose of constructing a ship canal through the territory of that State to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans I have directed the negotiation of a treaty with Nicaragua pledging both Governments to protect those who shall engage in and perfect the work. All other nations are invited by the State of Nicaragua to enter into the same treaty stipulations with her; and the benefit to be derived by each from such an arrangement will be the protection of this great interoceanic communication against any power which might seek to obstruct it or to monopolize its advantages. All States entering into such a treaty will enjoy the right of passage through the canal on payment of the same tolls. The work if constructed under these guaranties will become a bond of peace instead of a subject of contention and strife between the nations of the earth. Should the great maritime States of Europe consent to this arrangement (and we have no reason to suppose that a proposition so fair and honorable will be opposed by any) the energies of their people and ours will cooperate in promoting the success of the enterprise. I do not recommend any appropriation from the National Treasury for this purpose nor do I believe that such an appropriation is necessary. Private enterprise if properly protected will complete the work should it prove to be feasible. The parties who have procured the charter from Nicaragua for its construction desire no assistance from this Government beyond its protection; and they profess that having examined the proposed line of communication they will be ready to commence the undertaking whenever that protection shall be extended to them. Should there appear to be reason on examining the whole evence to entertain a serious doubt of the practicability of constructing such a canal that doubt could be speedily solved by an actual exploration of the route.< Should such a work be constructed under the common protection of all nations for equal benefits to all it would be neither just nor expedient that any great maritime state should command the communication. The territory through which the canal may be opened ought to be freed from the claims of any foreign power. No such power should occupy a position that would enable it hereafter to exercise so controlling an influence over the commerce of the world or to obstruct a highway which ought to be dedicated to the common uses of mankind.< The routes across the Isthmus at Tehuantepec and Panama are also worthy of our serious conseration.. They d not fail to engage the attention of my predecessor. The negotiator of the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo was instructed to offer a very large sum of money for the right of transit across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The Mexican Government d not accede to the proposition for the purchase of the right of way probably because it had already contracted with private inuals for the construction of a passage from the Guasacualco River to Tehuantepec. I shall not renew any proposition to purchase for money a right which ought to be equally secured to all nations on payment of a reasonable toll to the owners of the improvement who would doubtless be well contented with that compensation and the guaranties of the maritime states of the world in separate treaties negotiated with Mexico binding her and them to protect those who should construct the work. Such guaranties would do more to secure the completion of the communication through the territory of Mexico than any other reasonable conseration that could be offered; and as Mexico herself would be the greatest gainer by the opening of this communication between the Gulf and the Pacific Ocean it is presumed that she would not hesitate to yield her a in the manner proposed to accomplish an improvement so important to her own best interests.< We have reason to hope that the proposed railroad across the Isthmus at Panama will be successfully constructed under the protection of the late treaty with New Granada ratified and exchanged by my predecessor on the 10th day of June 1848 which guarantees the perfect neutrality of the Isthmus and the rights of sovereignty and property of New Granada over that territory with a  that the free transit from ocean to ocean may not be interrupted or embarrassed during the existence of the treaty. It is our policy to encourage every practicable route across the isthmus which connects North and South America either by railroad or canal which the energy and enterprise of our citizens may induce them to complete and I conser it obligatory upon me to adopt that policy especially in consequence of the absolute necessity of facilitating intercourse with our possessions on the Pacific.< The position of the Sandwich Islands with reference to the territory of the United States on the Pacific the success of our persevering and benevolent citizens who have repaired to that remote quarter in Christianizing the natives and inducing them to adopt a system of government and laws suited to their capacity and wants and the use made by our numerous whale ships of the harbors of the islands as places of resort for obtaining refreshments and repairs all combine to render their destiny peculiarly interesting to us. It is our duty to encourage the authorities of those islands in their efforts to improve and elevate the moral and political condition of the inhabitants and we should make reasonable allowances for the difficulties inseparable from this task. We desire that the islands may maintain their independence and that other nations should concur with us in this sentiment. We could in no event be indifferent to their passing under the dominion of any other power. The principal commercial states have in this a common interest and it is to be hoped that no one of them will attempt to interpose obstacles to the entire independence of the islands.< The receipts into the Treasury for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last were in cash $48830097.50 and in Treasury notes funded $10833000 making an aggregate of $59663097.50; and the expenditures for the same time were in cash $46798667.82 and in Treasury notes funded $10833000 making an aggregate of $57631667.82.< The accounts and estimates which will be submitted to Congress in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury show that there will probably be a deficit occasioned by the expenses of the Mexican War and treaty on the 1st day of July next of $5828121.66 and on the 1st day of July 1851 of $10547092.73 making in the whole a probable deficit to be proved for of $16375214.39. The extraordinary expenses of the war with Mexico and the purchase of California and New Mexico exceed in amount this deficit together with the loans heretofore made for those objects. I therefore recommend that authority be given to borrow what ever sum may be necessary to cover that deficit. I recommend the observance of strict economy in the appropriation and expenditure of public money.< I recommend a revision of the existing tariff and its adjustment on a basis which may augment the revenue. I do not doubt the right or duty of Congress to encourage domestic industry which is the great source of national as well as inual wealth and prosperity. I look to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress for the adoption of a system which may place home labor at last on a sure and permanent footing and by due encouragement of manufactures give a new and increased stimulus to agriculture and promote the development of our vast resources and the extension of our commerce. Believing that to the attainment of these ends as well as the necessary augmentation of the revenue and the prevention of frauds a system of specific duties is best adapted I strongly recommend to Congress the adoption of that system fixing the duties at rates high enough to afford substantial and sufficient encouragement to our own industry and at the same time so adjusted as to insure stability.< The question of the continuance of the subtreasury system is respectfully submitted to the wisdom of Congress. If continued important modifications of it appear to be indispensable.< For further details and s on the above and other matters connected with commerce the finances and revenue I refer to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.< No direct a has been given by the General Government to the improvement of agriculture except by the expenditure of small sums for the collection and publication of agricultural statistics and for some chemical analyses which have been thus far pa for out of the patent fund. This a is in my opinion wholly inadequate. To give to this leading branch of American industry the encouragement which it merits I respectfully recommend the establishment of an agricultural bureau to be connected with the Department of the Interior. To elevate the social condition of the agriculturist to increase his prosperity and to extend his means of usefulness to his country by multiplying his sources of information should be the study of every statesman and a primary object with every legislator.< No civil government having been proved by Congress for California the people of that Territory impelled by the necessities of their political condition recently met in convention for the purpose of forming a constitution and State government which the latest advices give me reason to suppose has been accomplished; and it is believed they will shortly apply for the admission of California into the Union as a sovereign State. Should such be the case and should their constitution be conformable to the requisitions of the Constitution of the United States I recommend their application to the favorable conseration of Congress. The people of New Mexico will also it is believed at no very distant period present themselves for admission into the Union. Preparatory to the admission of California and New Mexico the people of each will have instituted for themselves a republican form of government laying its foundation in such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. By awaiting their action all causes of uneasiness may be avoed and confence and kind feeling preserved. With a  of maintaining the harmony and tranquillity so dear to all we should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character which have hitherto produced painful apprehensions in the public mind; and I repeat the solemn warning of the first and most illustrious of my predecessors against furnishing any ground for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations.< A collector has been appointed at San Francisco under the act of Congress extending the revenue laws over California and measures have been taken to organize the customhouses at that and the other ports mentioned in that act at the earliest period practicable. The collector proceeded overland and advices have not yet been received of his arrival at San Francisco. Meanwhile it is understood that the customs have continued to be collected there by officers acting under the military authority as they were during the Administration of my predecessor. It will I think be expedient to confirm the collections thus made and direct the avails (after such allowances as Congress may think fit to authorize) to be expended within the Territory or to be pa into the Treasury for the purpose of meeting appropriations for the improvement of its rivers and harbors.< A party engaged on the coast survey was dispatched to Oregon in January last. According to the latest advices they had not left California; and directions have been given to them as soon as they shall have fixed on the sites of the two lighthouses and the buoys authorized to be constructed and placed in Oregon to proceed without delay to make reconnaissance of the most important points on the coast of California and especially to examine and determine on sites for lighthouses on that coast the speedy erection of which is urgently demanded by our raply increasing commerce.< I have transferred the Indian agencies from upper Missouri and Council Bluffs to Santa Fe and Salt Lake and have caused to be appointed subagents in the valleys of the Gila the Sacramento and the San Joaquin rivers. Still further legal provisions will be necessary for the effective and successful extension of our system of Indian intercourse over the new territories.< I recommend the establishment of a branch mint in California as it will in my opinion afford important facilities to those engaged in mining as well as to the Government in the disposition of the mineral lands.< I also recommend that commissions be organized by Congress to examine and dece upon the vality of the present subsisting land titles in California and New Mexico and that provision be made for the establishment of offices of surveyorgeneral in New Mexico California and Oregon and for the surveying and bringing into market the public lands in those Territories. Those lands remote in position and difficult of access ought to be disposed of on terms liberal to all but especially favorable to the early emigrants.< In order that the situation and character of the principal mineral deposits in California may be ascertained I recommend that a geological and mineralogical exploration be connected with the linear surveys and that the mineral lands be ed into small lots suitable for mining and be disposed of by sale or lease so as to give our citizens an opportunity of procuring a permanent right of property in the soil. This would seem to be as important to the success of mining as of agricultural pursuits.< The great mineral wealth of California and the advantages which its ports and harbors and those of Oregon afford to commerce especially with the islands of the Pacific and Indian oceans and the populous regions of eastern Asia make it certain that there will arise in a few years large and prosperous communities on our western coast. It therefore becomes important that a line of communication the best and most expeditious which the nature of the country will admit should be opened within the territory of the United States from the igable waters 
f the Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Opinion as elicited and expressed by two large and respectable conventions lately assembled at St. Louis and Memphis points to a railroad as that which if practicable will best meet the wishes and wants of the country. But while this if in successful operation would be a work of great national importance and of a value to the country which it would be difficult to estimate it ought also to be regarded as an undertaking of vast magnitude and expense and one which must if it be indeed practicable encounter many difficulties in its construction and use. Therefore to avo failure and disappointment; to enable Congress to judge whether in the condition of the country through which it must pass the work be feasible and if it be found so whether it should be undertaken as a national improvement or left to inual enterprise and in the latter alternative what a if any ought to be extended to it by the Government I recommend as a preliminary measure a careful reconnaissance of the several proposed routes by a scientific corps and a report as to the practicability of making such a road with an estimate of the cost of its construction and support.< For further s on these and other matters connected with the duties of the home department I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior.< I recommend early appropriations for continuing the river and harbor improvements which have been already begun and also for the construction of those for which estimates have been made as well as for examinations and estimates preparatory to the commencement of such others as the wants of the country and especially the advance of our population over new districts and the extension of commerce may render necessary. An estimate of the amount which can be advantageously expended within the next fiscal year under the direction of the Bureau of Topographical Engineers accompanies the report of the Secretary of War to which I respectfully invite the attention of Congress.< The cession of territory made by the late treaty with Mexico has greatly extended our exposed frontier and rendered its defense more difficult. That treaty has also brought us under obligations to Mexico to comply with which a military force is requisite. But our military establishment is not materially changed as to its efficiency from the condition in which it stood before the commencement of the Mexican War. Some addition to it will therefore be necessary and I recommend to the favorable conseration of Congress an increase of the several corps of the Army at our distant Western posts as proposed in the accompanying report of the Secretary of War.< Great embarrassment has resulted from the effect upon rank in the Army heretofore given to brevet and staff commissions. The s of the Secretary of War on this subject are deemed important and if carried into effect will it is believed promote the harmony of the service. The plan proposed for retiring disabled officers and proving an asylum for such of the rank and file as from age wounds and other infirmities occasioned by service have become unfit to perform their respective duties is recommended as a means of increasing the efficiency of the Army and as an act of justice due from a grateful country to the faithful soldier.< The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a full and satisfactory account of the condition and operations of the al service during the past year. Our citizens engaged in the legitimate pursuits of commerce have enjoyed its benefits. Wherever our national vessels have gone they have been received with respect our officers have been treated with kindness and courtesy and they have on all occasions pursued a course of strict neutrality in accordance with the policy of our Government.< The al force at present in commission is as large as is admissible with the number of men authorized by Congress to be employed.< I invite your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy on the subject of a reorganization of the Navy in its various grades of officers and the establishing of a retired list for such of the officers as are disqualified for active and effective service. Should Congress adopt some such measure as is recommended it will greatly increase the efficiency of the Navy and reduce its expenditures.< I also ask your attention to the s expressed by him in reference to the employment of war steamers and in regard to the contracts for the transportation of the United States mails and the operation of the system upon the prosperity of the Navy.< By an act of Congress passed August 14 1848 provision was made for extending postoffice and mail accommodations to California and Oregon. Exertions have been made to execute that law but the limited provisions of the act the inadequacy of the means it authorizes the ill adaptation of our postoffice laws to the situation of that country and the measure of compensation for services allowed by those laws compared with the prices of labor and rents in California render those exertions in a great degree ineffectual. More particular and efficient provision by law is required on this subject.< The act of 1845 reducing postage has now by its operation during four years produced results fully showing that the income from such reduced postage is sufficient to sustain the whole expense of the service of the PostOffice Department not including the cost of transportation in mail steamers on the lines from New York to Chagres and from Panama to Astoria which have not been consered by Congress as properly belonging to the mail service.< It is submitted to the wisdom of Congress whether a further reduction of postage should not now be made more particularly on the letter correspondence. This should be relieved from the unjust burden of transporting and delivering the franked matter of Congress for which public service provision should be made from the Treasury. I confently believe that a change may safely be made reducing all single letter postage to the uniform rate of 5 cents regardless of distance without thereby imposing any greater tax on the Treasury than would constitute a very moderate compensation for this public service; and I therefore respectfully recommend such a reduction. Should Congress prefer to abolish the franking privilege entirely it seems probable that no demand on the Treasury would result from the proposed reduction of postage. Whether any further diminution should now be made or the result of the reduction to 5 cents which I have recommended should be first tested is submitted to your decision.< Since the commencement of the last session of Congress a postal treaty with Great Britain has been received and ratified and such relations have been formed by the postoffice departments of the two countries in pursuance of that treaty as to carry its provisions into full operation. The attempt to extend this same arrangement through England to France has not been equally successful but the purpose has not been abandoned.< For a particular statement of the condition of the PostOffice Department and other matters connected with that branch of the public service I refer you to the report of the PostmasterGeneral.< By the act of the 3d of March 1849 a board was constituted to make arrangements for taking the Seventh Census composed of the Secretary of State the AttorneyGeneral and the PostmasterGeneral; and it was made the duty of this board to prepare and cause to be printed such forms and schedules as might be necessary for the full enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States and also proper forms and schedules for collecting in statistical tables under proper heads such information as to mines agriculture commerce manufactures education and other topics as would exhibit a full  of the pursuits industry education and resources of the country. The duties enjoined upon the census board thus established having been performed it now rests with Congress to enact a law for carrying into effect the provision of the Constitution which requires an actual enumeration of the people of the United States within the ensuing year.< Among the duties assigned by the Constitution to the General Government is one of local and limited application but not on that account the less obligatory. I allude to the trust committed to Congress as the exclusive legislator and sole guardian of the interests of the District of Columbia. I beg to commend these interests to your kind attention. As the national metropolis the city of Washington must be an object of general interest; and founded as it was under the auspices of him whose immortal name it bears its claims to the fostering care of Congress present themselves with additional strength. Whatever can contribute to its prosperity must enlist the feelings of its constitutional guardians and command their favorable conseration.< Our Government is one of limited powers and its successful administration eminently depends on the confinement of each of its coordinate branches within its own appropriate sphere. The first section of the Constitution ordains that< All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.< The Executive has authority to recommend (not to dictate) measures to Congress. Having performed that duty the executive department of the Government can not rightfully control the decision of Congress on any subject of legislation until that decision shall have been officially submitted to the Present for approval. The check proved by the Constitution in the clause conferring the qualified veto will never be exercised by me except in the cases cond by the fathers of the Republic. I  it as an extreme measure to be resorted to only in extraordinary cases as where it may become necessary to defend the executive against the encroachments of the legislative power or to prevent hasty and inconserate or unconstitutional legislation. By cautiously confining this remedy within the sphere prescribed to it in the contemporaneous expositions of the framers of the Constitution the will of the people legitimately expressed on all subjects of legislation through their constitutional organs the Senators and Representatives of the United States will have its full effect. As indispensable to the preservation of our system of selfgovernment the independence of the representatives of the States and the people is guaranteed by the Constitution and they owe no responsibility to any human power but their constituents. By holding the representative responsible only to the people and exempting him from all other influences we elevate the character of the constituent and quicken his sense of responsibility to his country. It is under these circumstances only that the elector can feel that in the choice of the lawmaker he is himself truly a component part of the sovereign power of the nation. With equal care we should study to defend the rights of the executive and judicial departments. Our Government can only be preserved in its purity by the suppression and entire elimination of every claim or tendency of one coordinate branch to encroachment upon another. With the strict observance of this rule and the other injunctions of the Constitution with a sedulous inculcation of that respect and love for the Union of the States which our fathers cherished and enjoined upon their children and with the a of that overruling Provence which has so long and so kindly guarded our liberties and institutions we may reasonably expect to transmit them with their innumerable blessings to the remotest posterity.< But attachment to the Union of the States should be habitually fostered in every American heart. For more than half a century during which kingdoms and empires have fallen this Union has stood unshaken. The patriots who formed it have long since descended to the grave; yet still it remains the proudest monument to their memory and the object of affection and admiration with everyone worthy to bear the American name. In my judgment its dissolution would be the greatest of calamities and to avert that should be the study of every American. Upon its preservation must depend our own happiness and that of countless generations to come. Whatever dangers may threaten it I shall stand by it and maintain it in its integrity to the full extent of the obligations imposed and the powers conferred upon me by the Constitution.< 
To the Senate of the United States:< I transmit to the Senate for its conseration with a  to its ratification a treaty of amity commerce and igation with the Republic of Texas negotiated at the seat of Government of the United States between the Secretary of State duly empowered for that purpose and the charge' d'affaires of that Republic.< In forming the first commercial treaty between the two Governments an anxious desire has been felt to introduce such provisions as should promote the interests of both countries. The immediate proximity of Texas to the United States and the consequent facility of intercourse the nature of its principal agricultural production and the relations which both countries bear to several large rivers which are boundaries between them and which in some part of their course run within the territories of both have caused peculiarities of condition and interests which it has been necessary to guard.< The treaty proves that Texas shall enjoy a right of deposit for such of her productions as may be introduced into the United States for exportation but upon the condition that the Executive of the United States may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the proper enjoyment of the privilege within our territory. It was thought no more than reasonable to grant this facility to the trade of Texas under such conditions as seem best calculated to guard against abuse or inconvenience.< The treaty further proves that raw cotton may be imported from either country into the other free of duties. In general it is not wise to enter into treaty stipulations respecting duties of import; they are usually much better left to the operation of general laws. But there are circumstances existing in this case which have been thought to justify a departure from the general rule and the addition of it to the number of instances not large in which regulations of duties of imports have been made the subject of national compact.< The United States consume large quantities of raw cotton but they are exporters of the article to a still greater extent. Texas for the present at least exports her whole crop. These exportations are in general to the same foreign markets and it is supposed to be of no conserable importance to the American producer whether he meets the Texan product at home or abroad.< On the other hand it is thought that a useful commercial intercourse would be promoted in several ways by receiving the raw cotton of Texas at once into the United States free of duty. The tendency of such a measure is to bring to the United States in the first instance Texan cotton ultimately destined to European markets. The natural effect of this it is supposed will be to increase the business of the cities of the United States to the extent of this importation and exportation and to secure a further degree of employment to the igation of the country. But these are by no means all the benefits which may be reasonably expected from the arrangement. Texas at least for a conserable time to come must import all the manufactured articles and much of the supplies and provisions necessary for her use and consumption. These commodities she will be likely to obtain if to be had in the markets of the country in which she disposes of her main annual product. The manufactures of the North and East therefore and the grain and provisions of the Western States are likely to find in Texas a demand increased by whatever augments intercourse between the two countries and especially by whatever tends to give attraction to the cities of the United States as marts for the sale of her great and principal article of export.< As a security; however against unforeseen results or occurrences it has been thought advisable to give this article of the treaty a limitation of five years.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives:< I have the pleasure of announcing to Congress the agreement on the part of Texas to the propositions offered to that State by the act of Congress approved on the 9th day of September last entitled An act proposing to the State of Texas the establishment of her northern and western boundaries the relinquishment by the sa State of all territory claimed by her exterior to sa boundaries and of all her claims upon the United States and to establish a Territorial government for New Mexico.< By the terms of that act it was required that the agreement of Texas to the propositions contained in it should be given on or before the 1st day of December 1850. An authenticated  of a law passed by the legislature of Texas on the 25th day of November agreeing to and accepting the propositions contained in the act of Congress has been received. This law after reciting the provisions of the act of Congress proceeds to enact and declare as follows viz:< Therefore first. Be it enacted by the legislature of the State of Texas that the State of Texas hereby agrees to and accepts sa propositions; and it is hereby declared that the sa State shall be bound by the terms thereof according to their true import and meaning.< Second. That the governor of this State be and is hereby requested to cause a copy of this act authenticated under the seal of the State to be furnished to the Present of the United States by mail as early as practicable and also a copy thereof certified in like manner to be transmitted to each of the Senators and Representatives of Texas in Congress. And that this act take effect from and after its passage.< C.G. KEENAN< Speaker of the House of Representatives.< JOHN A. GREER< Present of the Senate.< P.H. BELL.< Approved November 25 1850.< From the common sources of public information it would appear that a very remarkable degree of unanimity prevailed not only in the legislature but among the people of Texas in respect to the agreement of the State to that which had been proposed by Congress.< I can not refrain from congratulating Congress and the country on the success of this great and leading measure of conciliation and peace. The difficulties felt and the dangers apprehended from the vast acquisitions of territory under the late treaty with Mexico seem now happily overcome by the wisdom of Congress. Within that territory there already exists one State respectable for the amount of her population distinguished for singular activity and enterprise and remarkable in many respects from her condition and history. This new State has come into the Union with manifestations not to be mistaken of her attachment to that Constitution and that Government which now embrace her and her interests within their protecting and beneficent control.< Over the resue of the acquired territories regular Territorial governments are now established in the manner which has been most usual in the history of this Government. Various other acts of Congress may undoubtedly be requisite for the benefit as well as for the proper government of these so distant parts of the country. But the same legislative wisdom which has triumphed over the principal difficulties and accomplished the main end may safely be relied on for whatever measures may yet be found necessary to perfect its work so that the acquisition of these vast regions to the United States may rather strengthen than weaken the Constitution which is over us all and the Union which affords such ample daily proofs of its inestimable value.< 
To the House of Representatives of the United States:< It is with extreme regret that I feel myself constrained by the duty faithfully to execute the office of Present of the United States and to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States to return to the House in which it originated the bill to prove for the better collection safekeeping and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be d the Fiscal Corporation of the United States with my written objections.< In my message sent to the Senate on the 16th day of August last returning the bill to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the United States I distinctly declared that my own opinion had been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise of the power of Congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the Union and entertaining that opinion my main objection to that bill was based upon the highest moral and religious obligations of conscience and the Constitution. I readily admit that whilst the qualified veto with which the Chief Magistrate is invested should be regarded and was intended by the wise men who made it a part of the Constitution as a great conservative principle of our system without the exercise of which on important occasions a mere representative majority might urge the Government in its legislation beyond the limits fixed by its framers or might exert its just powers too hastily or oppressively yet it is a power which ought to be most cautiously exerted and perhaps never except in a case eminently involving the public interest or one in which the oath of the Present acting under his convictions both mental and moral imperiously requires its exercise. In such a case he has no alternative. must either exert the negative power intrusted to him by the Constitution chiefly for its own preservation protection and defense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude. Mere regard to the will of a majority must not in a constitutional republic like ours control this sacred and solemn duty of a sworn officer. The Constitution itself I regard and cherish as the embodied and written will of the whole people of the United States. It is their fixed and fundamental law which they unanimously prescribe to the public aries their mere trustees and servants. This their will and the law which they have given us as the rule of our action have no guard no guaranty of preservation protection and defense but the oaths which it prescribes to the public officers the sanctity with which they shall religiously observe those oaths and the patriotism with which the people shall shield it by their own sovereign will which has made the Constitution supreme. It must be exerted against the will of a mere representative majority or not at all. It is alone in pursuance of that will that any measure can reach the Present and to say that because a majority in Congress have passed a bill he should therefore sanction it is to abrogate the power altogether and to render its insertion in the Constitution a work of absolute supererogation. The duty is to guard the fundamental will of the people themselves from (in this case I admit unintentional) change or infraction by a majority in Congress; and in that light alone do I regard the constitutional duty which I now most reluctantly discharge. Is this bill now presented for my approval or disapproval such a bill as I have already declared could not receive my sanction? Is it such a bill as calls for the exercise of the negative power under the Constitution? Does it violate the Constitution by creating a national bank to operate per se over the Union? Its title in the first place describes its general character. It is an act to prove for the better collection safekeeping and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be d the Fiscal Corporation of the United States. In  then it is plainly national in its character. Its powers s and duties are those which pertain to the collecting keeping and disbursing the public revenue. The means by which these are to be exerted is a corporation to be d the Fiscal Corporation of the United States. It is a corporation created by the Congress of the United States in its character of a national legislature for the whole Union to perform the fiscal purposes meet the fiscal wants and exigencies supply the fiscal uses and exert the fiscal agencies of the Treasury of the United States. Such is its own description of itself. Do its provisions contradict its title? They do not. It is true that by its first section it proves that it shall be established in the District of Columbia; but the amount of its capital the manner in which its stock is to be subscribed for and held the persons and bodies corporate and politic by whom its stock may be held the appointment of its directors and their powers and duties its fundamental articles especially that to establish agencies in any part of the Union the corporate powers and business of such agencies the prohibition of Congress to establish any other corporation with similar powers for twenty years with express reservation in the same clause to modify or create any bank for the District of Columbia so that the aggregate capital shall not exceed five millions without enumerating other features which are equally distinctive and characteristic clearly show that it can not be regarded as other than a bank of the United States with powers seemingly more limited than have heretofore been granted to such an institution. It operates per se over the Union by virtue of the unaed and in my  assumed authority of Congress as a national legislature as distinguishable from a bank created by Congress for the District of Columbia as the local legislature of the District. Every United States bank heretofore created has had power to deal in bills of exchange as well as local discounts. Both were trading privileges conferred and both were exercised by virtue of the aforesa power of Congress over the whole Union. The question of power remains unchanged without reference to the extent of privilege granted. If this proposed corporation is to be regarded as a local bank of the District of Columbia invested by Congress with general powers to operate over the Union it is obnoxious to still stronger objections. It assumes that Congress may invest a local institution with general or national powers. With the same propriety that it may do this in regard to a bank of the District of Columbia it may as to a State bank. Yet who can indulge the ea that this Government can rightfully by making a State bank its fiscal agent invest it with the absolute and unqualified powers conferred by this bill? When I come to look at the details of the bill they do not recommend it strongly to my adoption. A brief notice of some of its provisions will suffice.< First. It may justify substantially a system of discounts of the most objectionable character. It is to deal in bills of exchange drawn in one State and payable in another without any restraint. The bill of exchange may have an unlimited time to run and its renewability is nowhere guarded against. It may in fact assume the most objectionable form of accommodation paper. It is not required to rest on any actual real or substantial exchange basis. A drawer in one place becomes the accepter in another and so in turn the accepter may become the drawer upon a mutual understanding. It may at the same time indulge in mere local discounts under the name of bills of exchange. A bill drawn at Philadelphia on Camden N.J. at New York on a border town in New Jersey at Cincinnati on Newport in Kentucky not to multiply other examples might for anything in this bill to restrain it become a mere matter of local accommodation. Cities thus relatively situated would possess advantages Over cities otherwise situated of so deced a character as most justly to excite dissatisfaction.< Second. There is no limit prescribed to the premium in the purchase of bills of exchange thereby correcting none of the evils under which the community now labors and operating most injuriously upon the agricultural States in which the irregularities in the rates of exchange are most severely felt. Nor are these the only consequences. A resumption of specie payments by the banks of those States would be liable to indefinite postponement; for as the operation of the agencies of the interior would chiefly consist in selling bills of exchange and the purchases could only be made in specie or the notes of banks paying specie the State banks would either have to continue with their doors closed or exist at the mercy of this national monopoly of brokerage. Nor can it be passed over without remark that whilst the District of Columbia is made the seat of the principal bank its citizens are excluded from all participation in any benefit it might afford by a positive prohibition on the bank from all discounting within the District.< These are some of the objections which prominently exist against the details of the bill. Others might be urged of much force but it would be unprofitable to dwell upon them. Suffice it to add that this charter is designed to continue for twenty years without a competitor; that the defects to which I have alluded being founded on the fundamental law of the corporation are irrevocable and that if the objections be well founded it would be over hazardous to pass the bill into a law.< In conclusion I take leave most respectfully to say that I have felt the most anxious solicitude to meet the wishes of Congress in the adoption of a fiscal agent which avoing all constitutional objections should harmonize conflicting opinions. Actuated by this feeling I have been ready to yield much in a spirit of conciliation to the opinions of others; and it is with great pain that I now feel compelled to differ from Congress a second time in the same session. At the commencement of this session inclined from choice to defer to the legislative will I submitted to Congress the propriety of adopting a fiscal agent which without violating the Constitution would separate the public money from the Executive control and perform the operations of the Treasury without being burdensome to the people or inconvenient or expensive to the Government. It is deeply to be regretted that this department of the Government can not upon constitutional and other grounds concur with the legislative department in this last measure proposed to attain these desirable objects. Owing to the brief space between the period of the death of my lamented predecessor and my own installation into office I was in fact not left time to prepare and submit a definitive recommendation of my own in my regular message and since my mind has been wholly occupied in a most anxious attempt to conform my action to the legislative will. In this communication I am confined by the Constitution to my objections simply to this bill but the period of the regular session will soon arrive when it will be my duty under another clause of the Constitution to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their conseration such measures as I shall judge necessary and expedient. And I most respectfully submit in a spirit of harmony whether the present differences of opinion should be pressed further at this time and whether the peculiarity of my situation does not entitle me to a postponement of this subject to a more auspicious period for deliberation. The two Houses of Congress have distinguished themselves at this extraordinary session by the performance of an immense mass of labor at a season very unfavorable both to health and action and have passed many laws which I trust will prove highly beneficial to the interests of the country and fully answer its just expectations. It has been my good fortune and pleasure to concur with them in all measures except this. And why should our difference on this alone be pushed to extremes? It is my anxious desire that it should not be. I too have been burdened with extraordinary labors of late and I sincerely desire time for deep and deliberate reflection on this the greatest difficulty of my Administration. May we not now pause until a more favorable time when with the most anxious hope that the Executive and Congress may cordially unite some measure of finance may be deliberately adopted promotive of the good of our common country?< I will take this occasion to declare that the conclusions to which I have brought myself are those of a settled conviction founded in my opinion on a just  of the Constitution; that in arriving at it I have been actuated by no other motive or desire than to uphold the institutions of the country as they have come down to us from the hands of our godlike ancestors and that I shall esteem my efforts to sustain them even though I perish more honorable than to win the  of men by a sacrifice of my duty and my conscience.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:< We have continued reason to express our profound gratitude to the Great Creator of All Things for numberless benefits conferred upon us as a people. Blessed with genial seasons the husbandman has his garners filled with abundance and the necessaries of life not to speak of its luxuries abound in every direction. While in some other nations steady and industrious labor can hardly find the means of subsistence the greatest evil which we have to encounter is a surplus of production beyond the home demand which seeks and with difficulty finds a partial market in other regions. The health of the country with partial exceptions has for the past year been well preserved and under their free and wise institutions the United States are raply advancing toward the consummation of the high destiny which an overruling Provence seems to have marked out for them. Exempt from domestic convulsion and at peace with all the world we are left free to consult as to the best means of securing and advancing the happiness of the people. Such are the circumstances under which you now assemble in your respective chambers and which should lead us to unite in praise and thanksgiving to that great Being who made us and who preserves us as a nation.< I congratulate you fellowcitizens on the happy change in the aspect of our foreign affairs since my last annual message. Causes of complaint at that time existed between the United States and Great Britain which attended by irritating circumstances threatened most seriously the public peace. The difficulty of adjusting amicably the questions at issue between the two countries was in no small degree augmented by the lapse of time since they had their origin. The opinions entertained by the Executive on several of the leading topics in dispute were frankly set forth in the message at the opening of your late session. The appointment of a special minister by Great Britain to the United States with power to negotiate upon most of the points of difference indicated a desire on her part amicably to adjust them and that minister was met by the Executive in the same spirit which had dictated his mission. The treaty consequent thereon having been duly ratified by the two Governments a copy together with the correspondence which accompanied it is herewith communicated. I trust that whilst you may see in it nothing objectionable it may be the means of preserving for an indefinite period the amicable relations happily existing between the two Governments. The question of peace or war between the United States and Great Britain is a question of the deepest interest not only to themselves but to the civilized world since it is scarcely possible that a war could exist between them without endangering the peace of Christendom. The immediate effect of the treaty upon ourselves will be felt in the security afforded to mercantile enterprise which no longer apprehensive of interruption adventures its speculations in the most distant seas and freighted with the ersified productions of every land returns to bless our own. There is nothing in the treaty which in the slightest degree compromits the honor or dignity of either nation. Next to the settlement of the boundary line which must always be a matter of difficulty between states as between inuals the question which seemed to threaten the greatest embarrassment was that connected with the African slave trade.< By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it was expressly declared that< Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice and whereas both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object.< In the enforcement of the laws and treaty stipulations of Great Britain a practice had threatened to grow up on the part of its cruisers of subjecting to visitation ships sailing under the American flag which while it seriously involved our maritime rights would subject to vexation a branch of our trade which was daily increasing and which required the fostering care of Government. And although Lord Aberdeen in his correspondence with the American envoys at London expressly disclaimed all right to detain an American ship on the high seas even if found with a cargo of slaves on board and restricted the British pretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire yet it could not well be discerned by the Executive of the United States how such visit and inquiry could be made without detention on the voyage and consequent interruption to the trade. It was regarded as the right of search presented only in a new form and expressed in different words and I therefore felt it to be my duty distinctly to declare in my annual message to Congress that no such concession could be made and that the United States had both the will and the ability to enforce their own laws and to protect their flag from being used for purposes wholly forbden by those laws and obnoxious to the moral censure of the world. Taking the message as his letter of instructions our then minister at Paris felt himself required to assume the same ground in a remonstrance which he felt it to be his duty to present to Mr. Guizot and through him to the King of the French against what has been called the quintuple treaty; and his conduct in this respect met with the approval of this Government. In close conformity with these s the eighth article of the treaty was framed; which proves that each nation shall keep afloat in the African seas a force not less than 80 guns to act separately and apart under instructions from their respective Governments and for the enforcement of their respective laws and obligations. From this it will be seen that the ground assumed in the message has been fully maintained at the same time that the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent are to be carried out in good faith by the two countries and that all pretense is removed for interference with our commerce for any purpose whatever by a foreign government. While therefore the United States have been standing up for the freedom of the seas they have not thought proper to make that a pretext for avoing a fulfillment of their treaty stipulations or a ground for giving countenance to a trade reprobated by our laws. A similar arrangement by the other great powers could not fail to sweep from the ocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new principle into the maritime code. We may be permitted to hope that the example thus set will be followed by some if not all of them. We thereby also afford suitable protection to the fair trader in those seas thus fulfilling at the same time the dictates of a sound policy and complying with the claims of justice and humanity.< It would have furnished additional cause for congratulation if the treaty could have embraced all subjects calculated in future to lead to a misunderstanding between the two Governments. The Territory of the United States commonly called the Oregon Territory lying on the Pacific Ocean north of the fortysecond degree of latitude to a portion of which Great Britain lays claim begins to attract the attention of our fellowcitizens and the te of population which has reclaimed what was so lately an unbroken wilderness in more contiguous regions is preparing to flow over those vast districts which stretch from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. In advance of the acquirement of inual rights to these lands sound policy dictates that every effort should be resorted to by the two Governments to settle their respective claims. It became manifest at an early hour of the late negotiations that any attempt for the time being satisfactorily to determine those rights would lead to a protracted discussion which might embrace in its failure other more pressing matters and the Executive d not regard it as proper to waive all the advantages of an honorable adjustment of other difficulties of great magnitude and importance because this not so immediately pressing stood in the way. Although the difficulty referred to may not for several years to come involve the peace of the two countries yet I shall not delay to urge on Great Britain the importance of its early settlement. Nor will other matters of commercial importance to the two countries be overlooked and I have good reason to believe that it will comport with the policy of England as it does with that of the United States to seize upon this moment when most of the causes of irritation have passed away to cement the peace and amity of the two countries by wisely removing all grounds of probable future collision.< With the other powers of Europe our relations continue on the most amicable footing. Treaties now existing with them should be rigly observed and every opportunity compatible with the interests of the United States should be seized upon to enlarge the basis of commercial intercourse. Peace with all the world is the true foundation of our policy which can only be rendered permanent by the practice of equal and impartial justice to all. Our great desire should be to enter only into that rivalry which looks to the general good in the cultivation of the sciences the enlargement of the field for the exercise of the mechanical arts and the spread of commercethat great civilizerto every land and sea. Carefully abstaining from interference in all questions exclusively referring themselves to the political interests of Europe we may be permitted to hope an equal exemption from the interference of European Governments in what relates to the States of the American continent.< On the 23d of April last the commissioners on the part of the United States under the convention with the Mexican Republic of the 11th of April 1839 made to the proper Department a final report in relation to the proceedings of the commission. From this it appears that the total amount awarded to the claimants by the commissioners and the umpire appointed under that convention was $2026079.68. The arbiter having consered that his s were required by the convention to terminate at the same time with those of the commissioners returned to the board undeced for want of time claims which had been allowed by the American commissioners to the amount of $928620.88. Other claims in which the amount sought to be recovered was $3336837.05 were submitted to the board too late for its conseration. The minister of the United States at Mexico has been duly authorized to make demand for payment of the awards according to the terms of the convention and the provisions of the act of Congress of the 12th of June 1840. has also been instructed to communicate to that Government the expectations of the Government of the United States in relation to those claims which were not disposed of according to the provisions of the convention and all others of citizens of the United States against the Mexican Government. has also been furnished with other instructions to be followed by him in case the Government of Mexico should not find itself in a condition to make present payment of the amount of the awards in specie or its equivalent.< I am happy to be able to say that information which is esteemed favorable both to a just satisfaction of the awards and a reasonable provision for other claims has been recently received from Mr. Thompson the minister of the United States who has promptly and efficiently executed the instructions of his Government in regard to this important subject.< The citizens of the United States who accompanied the late Texan expedition to Santa Fe and who were wrongfully taken and held as prisoners of war in Mexico have all been liberated.< A correspondence has taken place between the Department of State and the Mexican minister of foreign affairs upon the complaint of Mexico that citizens of the United States were permitted to give a to the inhabitants of Texas in the war existing between her and that Republic. Copies of this correspondence are herewith communicated to Congress together with copies of letters on the same subject addressed to the diplomatic corps at Mexico by the American minister and the Mexican secretary of state.< Mexico has thought proper to reciprocate the mission of the United States to that Government by accrediting to this a minister of the same rank as that of the representative of the United States in Mexico. From the circumstances connected with his mission favorable results are anticipated from it. It is so obviously for the interest of both countries as neighbors and friends that all just causes of mutual dissatisfaction should be removed that it is to be hoped neither will omit or delay the employment of any practicable and honorable means to accomplish that end.< The affairs pending between this Government and several others of the States of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of Spain have again within the past year been materially obstructed by the military revolutions and conflicts in those countries.< The ratifications of the treaty between the United States and the Republic of Ecuador of the 13th of June 1839 have been exchanged and that instrument has been duly promulgated on the part of this Government. Copies are now communicated to Congress with a  to enable that body to make such changes in the laws applicable to our intercourse with that Republic as may be deemed requisite.< Provision has been made by the Government of Chile for the payment of the claim on account of the illegal detention of the brig Warrior at Coquimbo in 1820. This Government has reason to expect that other claims of our citizens against Chile will be hastened to a final and satisfactory close.< The Empire of Brazil has not been altogether exempt from those convulsions which so constantly afflict the neighboring republics. Disturbances which recently broke out are however now understood to be quieted. But these occurrences by threatening the stability of the governments or by causing incessant and violent changes in them or in the persons who administer them tend greatly to retard provisions for a just indemnity for losses and injuries suffered by inual subjects or citizens of other states. The Government of the United States will feel it to be its duty however to consent to no delay not uoable in making satisfaction for wrongs and injuries sustained by its own citizens. Many years having in some cases elapsed a decisive and effectual course of proceeding will be demanded of the respective governments against whom claims have been preferred.< The vexatious harassing and expensive war which so long prevailed with the Indian tribes inhabiting the peninsula of Flora has happily been terminated whereby our Army has been relieved from a service of the most disagreeable character and the Treasury from a large expenditure. Some casual outbreaks may occur such as are incent to the close proximity of border settlers and the Indians but these as in all other cases may be left to the care of the local authorities aed when occasion may require by the forces of the United States. A sufficient number of troops will be maintained in Flora so long as the remotest apprehensions of danger shall exist yet their duties will be limited rather to the garrisoning of the necessary posts than to the maintenance of active hostilities. It is to be hoped that a territory so long retarded in its growth will now speedily recover from the evils incent to a protracted war exhibiting in the increased amount of its rich productions true evences of returning wealth and prosperity. By the practice of rig justice toward the numerous Indian tribes resing within our territorial limits and the exercise of a parental vigilance over their interests protecting them against fraud and intrusion and at the same time using every proper expedient to introduce among them the arts of civilized life we may fondly hope not only to wean them from their love of war but to inspire them with a love for peace and all its avocations. With several of the tribes great progress in civilizing them has already been made. The schoolmaster and the missionary are found se by se and the remnants of what were once numerous and powerful nations may yet be preserved as the builders up of a new name for themselves and their posterity.< The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January 1842 exclusive of the amount deposited with the States trust funds and indemnities was $230483.68. The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the present year from all sources amount to $26616593.78 of which more than fourteen millions were received from customs and about one million from the public lands. The receipts for the fourth quarter are estimated at nearly eight millions of which four millions are expected from customs and three millions and a half from loans and Treasury notes. The expenditures of the first three quarters of the present year exceed twentysix millions and those estimated for the fourth quarter amount to about eight millions; and it is anticipated there will be a deficiency of half a million on the 1st of January next but that the amount of outstanding warrants (estimated at $800000) will leave an actual balance of about $224000 in the Treasury. Among the expenditures of this year are more than eight millions for the public debt and about $600000 on account of the distribution to the States of the proceeds of sales of the public lands.< The present tariff of duties was somewhat hastily and hurriedly passed near the close of the late session of Congress. That it should have defects can therefore be surprising to no one. To remedy such defects as may be found to exist in any of its numerous provisions will not fail to claim your serious attention. It may well merit inquiry whether the exaction of all duties in cash does not call for the introduction of a system which has proved highly beneficial in countries where it has been adopted. I refer to the warehousing system. The first and most prominent effect which it would produce would be to protect the market alike against redundant or deficient supplies of foreign fabrics both of which in the long run are injurious as well to the manufacturer as the importer. The quantity of goods in store being at all times readily known it would enable the importer with an approach to accuracy to ascertain the actual wants of the market and to regulate himself accordingly. If however he should fall into error by importing an excess above the public wants he could readily correct its evils by availing himself of the benefits and advantages of the system thus established. In the storehouse the goods imported would await the demand of the market and their issues would be governed by the fixed principles of demand and supply. Thus an approximation would be made to a steadiness and uniformity of price which if attainable would conduce to the deced advantage of mercantile and mechanical operations.< The apprehension may be well entertained that without something to ameliorate the rigor of cash payments the entire import trade may fall into the hands of a few wealthy capitalists in this country and in Europe. The small importer who requires all the money he can raise for investments abroad and who can but ill afford to pay the lowest duty would have to subduct in advance a portion of his funds in order to pay the duties and would lose the interest upon the amount thus pa for all the time the goods might remain unsold which might absorb his profits. The rich capitalist abroad as well as at home would thus possess after a short time an almost exclusive monopoly of the import trade and laws designed for the benefit of all would thus operate for the benefit of a fewa result wholly uncongenial with the spirit of our institutions and antirepublican in all its tendencies. The warehousing system would enable the importer to watch the market and to select his own time for offering his goods for sale. A profitable portion of the carrying trade in articles entered for the benefit of drawback must also be most seriously affected without the adoption of some expedient to relieve the cash system. The warehousing system would afford that relief since the carrier would have a safe recourse to the public storehouses and might without advancing the duty reship within some reasonable period to foreign ports. A further effect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawbacks thereby effectually protecting the Government against fraud as the right of debenture would not attach to goods after their withdrawal from the public stores.< In revising the existing tariff of duties should you deem it proper to do so at your present session I can only repeat the suggestions and recommendations which upon several occasions I have heretofore felt it to be my duty to offer to Congress. The great primary and controlling interest of the American people is unionunion not only in the mere forms of government forms which may be broken but union rounded in an attachment of States and inuals for each other. This union in sentiment and feeling can only be preserved by the adoption of that course of policy which neither giving exclusive benefits to some nor imposing unnecessary burthens upon others shall consult the interests of all by pursuing a course of moderation and thereby seeking to harmonize public opinion and causing the people everywhere to feel and to know that the Government is careful of the interests of all alike. Nor is there any subject in regard to which moderation connected with a wise discrimination is more necessary than in the imposition of duties on imports. Whether reference be had to revenue the primary object in the imposition of taxes or to the incents which necessarily flow from their imposition this is entirely true. Extravagant duties defeat their end and object not only by exciting in the public mind an hostility to the manufacturing interests but by inducing a system of smuggling on an extensive scale and the practice of every manner of fraud upon the revenue which the utmost vigilance of Government can not effectually suppress. An opposite course of policy would be attended by results essentially different of which every interest of society and none more than those of the manufacturer would reap important advantages. Among the most striking of its benefits would be that derived from the general acquiescence of the country in its support and the consequent permanency and stability which would be given to all the operations of industry. It can not be too often repeated that no system of legislation can be wise which is fluctuating and uncertain. No interest can thrive under it. The prudent capitalist will never adventure his capital in manufacturing establishments or in any other leading pursuit of life if there exists a state of uncertainty as to whether the Government will repeal tomorrow what it has enacted today. Fitful profits however high if threatened with a ruinous reduction by a vacillating policy on the part of Government will scarcely tempt him to trust the money which he has acquired by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure. I therefore in the spirit of conciliation and influenced by no other desire than to rescue the great interests of the country from the vortex of political contention and in the discharge of the high and solemn duties of the place which I now occupy recommend moderate duties imposed with a wise discrimination as to their several objects as being not only most likely to be durable but most advantageous to every interest of society.< The report of the Secretary of the War Department exhibits a very full and satisfactory account of the various and important interests committed to the charge of that officer. It is particularly gratifying to find that the expenditures for the military service are greatly reduced in amountthat a strict system of economy has been introduced into the service and the abuses of past years greatly reformed. The fortifications on our maritime frontier have been prosecuted with much vigor and at many points our defenses are in a very conserable state of forwardness. The suggestions in reference to the establishment of means of communication with our territories on the Pacific and to the surveys so essential to a knowledge of the resources of the intermediate country are entitled to the most favorable conseration. While I would propose nothing inconsistent with friendly negotiations to settle the extent of our claims in that region yet a prudent forecast points out the necessity of such measures as may enable us to maintain our rights. The arrangements made for preserving our neutral relations on the boundary between us and Texas and keeping in check the Indians in that quarter will be maintained so long as circumstances may require. For several years angry contentions have grown out of the disposition directed by law to be made of the mineral lands held by the Government in several of the States. The Government is constituted the landlord and the Citizens of the States wherein lie the lands are its tenants. The relation is an unwise one and it would be much more conducive of the public interest that a sale of the lands should be made than that they should remain in their present condition. The supply of the ore would be more abundantly and certainly furnished when to be drawn from the enterprise and the industry of the proprietor than under the present system.< The recommendations of the Secretary in regard to the improvements of the Western waters and certain prominent harbors on the Lakes merit and I doubt not will receive your serious attention. The great importance of these subjects to the prosperity of the extensive region referred to and the security of the whole country in time of war can not escape observation. The losses of life and property which annually occur in the igation of the Mississippi alone because of the dangerous obstructions in the river make a loud demand upon Congress for the adoption of efficient measures for their removal.< The report of the Secretary of the Navy will bring you acquainted with that important branch of the public defenses. Consering the already vast and daily increasing commerce of the country apart from the exposure to hostile inroad of an extended seaboard all that relates to the Navy is calculated to excite particular attention. Whatever tends to add to its efficiency without entailing unnecessary charges upon the Treasury is well worthy of your serious conseration. It will be seen that while an appropriation exceeding by more than a million the appropriations of the current year is asked by the Secretary yet that in this sum is proposed to be included $400000 for the purchase of clothing which when once expended will be annually reimbursed by the sale of the clothes and will thus constitute a perpetual fund without any new appropriation to the same object. To this may also be added $50000 asked to cover the arrearages of past years and $250000 in order to maintain a competent squadron on the coast of Africa; all of which when deducted will reduce the expenditures nearly within the limits of those of the current year. While however the expenditures will thus remain very nearly the same as of the antecedent year it is proposed to add greatly to the operations of the marine and in lieu of only 25 ships in commission and but little in the way of building to keep with the same expenditure 41 vessels afloat and to build 12 ships of a small .< A strict system of accountability is established and great pains are taken to insure industry felity and economy in every department of duty. Experiments have been instituted to test the quality of various materials particularly copper iron and coal so as to prevent fraud and imposition.< It will appear by the report of the PostmasterGeneral that the great point which for several years has been so much desired has during the current year been fully accomplished. The expenditures of the Department for current service have been brought within its income without lessening its general usefulness. There has been an increase of revenue equal to $166000 for the year 1842 over that of 1841 without as it is believed any addition having been made to the number of letters and newspapers transmitted through the mails. The postoffice laws have been honestly administered and felity has been observed in accounting for and paying over by the subordinates of the Department the moneys which have been received. For the details of the service I refer you to the report.< I flatter myself that the exhibition thus made of the condition of the public administration will serve to convince you that every proper attention has been pa to the interests of the country by those who have been called to the heads of the different Departments. The reduction in the annual expenditures of the Government already accomplished furnishes a sure evence that economy in the application of the public moneys is regarded as a paramount duty.< At peace with all the world the personal liberty of the citizen sacredly maintained and his rights secured under political institutions deriving all their authority from the direct sanction of the people with a soil fertile almost beyond example and a country blessed with every ersity of climate and production what remains to be done in order to advance the happiness and prosperity of such a people? Under ordinary circumstances this inquiry could readily be answered. The best that probably could be done for a people inhabiting such a country would be to fortify their peace and security in the prosecution of their various pursuits by guarding them against invasion from without and violence from within. The rest for the greater part might be left to their own energy and enterprise. The chief embarrassments which at the moment exhibit themselves have arisen from overaction and the most difficult task which remains to be accomplished is that of correcting and overcoming its effects. Between the years 1833 and 1838 additions were made to bank capital and bank issues in the form of notes designed for circulation to an extent enormously great. The question seemed to be not how the best currency could be proved but in what manner the greatest amount of bank paper could be put in circulation. Thus a vast amount of what was called moneysince for the time being it answered the purposes of moneywas thrown upon the country an overissue which was attended as a necessary consequence by an extravagant increase of the prices of all articles of property the spread of a speculative mania all over the country and has finally ended in a general indebtedness on the part of States and inuals the prostration of public and private credit a depreciation in the market value of real and personal estate and has left large districts of country almost entirely without any circulating medium. In  of the fact that in 1830 the whole banknote circulation within the United States amounted to but $61323898 according to the Treasury statements and that an addition had been made thereto of the enormous sum of $88000000 in seven years (the circulation on the 1st of January 1837 being stated at $149185890) aed by the great facilities afforded in obtaining loans from European capitalists who were seized with the same speculative mania which prevailed in the United States and the large importations of funds from abroadthe result of stock sales and loansno one can be surprised at the apparent but unsubstantial state of prosperity which everywhere prevailed over the land; and as little cause of surprise should be felt at the present prostration of everything and the ruin which has befallen so many of our fellowcitizens in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of bank issues since 1837exceeding as is believed the amount added to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to 1837it ceases to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck should have been made of private fortunes or that difficulties should exist in meeting their engagements on the part of the debtor States; apart from which if there be taken into account the immense losses sustained in the dishonor of numerous banks it is less a matter of surprise that insolvency should have visited many of our fellowcitizens than that so many should have escaped the blighting influences of the times.< In the solemn conviction
of these truths and with an ardent desire to meet the pressing necessities of the country I felt it to be my duty to cause to be submitted to you at the commencement of your last session the plan of an exchequer the whole power and duty of maintaining which in purity and vigor was to be exercised by the representatives of the people and the States and therefore virtually by the people themselves. It was proposed to place it under the control and direction of a Treasury board to consist of three commissioners whose duty it should be to see that the law of its creation was faithfully executed and that the great end of supplying a paper medium of exchange at all times convertible into gold and silver should be attained. The board thus constituted was given as much permanency as could be imparted to it without endangering the proper share of responsibility which should attach to all public agents. In order to insure all the advantages of a wellmatured experience the commissioners were to hold their offices for the respective periods of two four and six years thereby securing at all times in the management of the exchequer the services of two men of experience; and to place them in a condition to exercise perfect independence of mind and action it was proved that their removal should only take place for actual incapacity or infelity to the trust and to be followed by the Present with an exposition of the causes of such removal should it occur. It was proposed to establish subordinate boards in each of the States under the same restrictions and limitations of the power of removal which with the central board should receive safely keep and disburse the public moneys. And in order to furnish a sound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should retain of the revenues of the Government a sum not to exceed $5000000 in specie to be set apart as required by its operations and to pay the public creditor at his own option either in specie or Treasury notes of denominations not less than $5 nor exceeding $100 which notes should be redeemed at the several places of issue and to be receivable at all times and everywhere in payment of Government dues with a restraint upon such issue of bills that the same should not exceed the maximum of $15000000. In order to guard against all the hazards incent to fluctuations in trade the Secretary of the Treasury was invested with authority to issue $5000000 of Government stock should the same at any time be regarded as necessary in order to place beyond hazard the prompt redemption of the bills which might be thrown into circulation; thus in fact making the issue of $15000000 of exchequer bills rest substantially on $10000000 and keeping in circulation never more than one and onehalf dollars for every dollar in specie. When to this it is added that the bills are not only everywhere receivable in Government dues but that the Government itself would be bound for their ultimate redemption no rational doubt can exist that the paper which the exchequer would furnish would readily enter into general circulation and be maintained at all times at or above par with gold and silver thereby realizing the great want of the age and fulfilling the wishes of the people. In order to reimburse the Government the expenses of the plan it was proposed to invest the exchequer with the limited authority to deal in bills of exchange (unless prohibited by the State in which an agency might be situated) having only thirty days to run and resting on a fair and bona fe basis. The legislative will on this point might be so plainly announced as to avo all pretext for partiality or favoritism. It was furthermore proposed to invest this Treasury agent with authority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie funds of inuals and to grant certificates therefor to be redeemed on presentation under the ea which is believed to be well founded that such certificates would come in a of the exchequer bills in supplying a safe and ample paper circulation. Or if in place of the cond dealings in exchange the exchequer should be authorized not only to exchange its bills for actual deposits of specie but for specie or its equivalent to sell drafts charging therefor a small but reasonable premium I can not doubt but that the benefits of the law would be speedily manifested in the revival of the credit trade and business of the whole country. Entertaining this opinion it becomes my duty to urge its adoption upon Congress by reference to the strongest conserations of the public interests with such alterations in its details as Congress may in its wisdom see fit to make.< I am well aware that this proposed alteration and amendment of the laws establishing the Treasury Department has encountered various objections and that among others it has been proclaimed a Government bank of fearful and dangerous import. It is proposed to confer upon it no extraordinary power. It purports to do no more than pay the debts of the Government with the redeemable paper of the Government in which respect it accomplishes precisely what the Treasury does daily at this time in issuing to the public creditors the Treasury notes which under law it is authorized to issue. It has no resemblance to an ordinary bank as it furnishes no profits to private stockholders and lends no capital to inuals. If it be objected to as a Government bank and the objection be available then should all the laws in relation to the Treasury be repealed and the capacity of the Government to collect what is due to it or pay what it owes be abrogated.< This is the chief purpose of the proposed exchequer and surely if in the accomplishment of a purpose so essential it affords a sound circulating medium to the country and facilities to trade it should be regarded as no slight recommendation of it to public conseration. Properly guarded by the provisions of law it can run into no dangerous evil nor can any abuse arise under it but such as the Legislature itself will be answerable for if it be tolerated since it is but the creature of the law and is susceptible at all times of modification amendment or repeal at the pleasure of Congress. I know that it has been objected that the system would be liable to be abused by the Legislature by whom alone it could be abused in the party conflicts of the day; that such abuse would manifest itself in a change of the law which would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the purpose of inflating prices and winning popular favor. To that it may be answered that the ascription of such a motive to Congress is altogether gratuitous and inadmissible. The theory of our institutions would lead us to a different conclusion. But a perfect security against a proceeding so reckless would be found to exist in the very nature of things. The political party which should be so blind to the true interests of the country as to resort to such an expedient would inevitably meet with final overthrow in the fact that the moment the paper ceased to be convertible into specie or otherwise promptly redeemed it would become worthless and would in the end dishonor the Government involve the people in ruin and such political party in hopeless disgrace. At the same time such a  involves the utter impossibility of furnishing any currency other than that of the precious metals; for if the Government itself can not forego the temptation of excessive paper issues what reliance can be placed in corporations upon whom the temptations of inual aggrandizement would most strongly operate? The people would have to blame none but themselves for any injury that might arise from a course so reckless since their agents would be the wrongdoers and they the passive spectators.< There can be but three kinds of public currencyfirst gold and silver; second the paper of State institutions; or third a representative of the precious metals proved by the General Government or under its authority. The subtreasury system rejected the last in any form and as it was believed that no reliance could be placed on the issues of local institutions for the purposes of general circulation it necessarily and uoably adopted specie as the exclusive currency for its own use; and this must ever be the case unless one of the other kinds be used. The choice in the present state of public sentiment lies between an exclusive specie currency on the one hand and Government issues of some kind on the other. That these issues can not be made by a chartered institution is supposed to be conclusively settled. They must be made then directly by Government agents. For several years past they have been thus made in the form of Treasury notes and have answered a valuable purpose. Their usefulness has been limited by their being transient and temporary; their ceasing to bear interest at given periods necessarily causes their speedy return and thus restricts their range of circulation and being used only in the disbursements of Government they can not reach those points where they are most required. By rendering their use permanent to the moderate extent already mentioned by offering no inducement for their return and by exchanging them for coin and other values they will constitute to a certain extent the general currency so much needed to maintain the internal trade of the country. And this is the exchequer plan so far as it may operate in furnishing a currency.< I can not forego the occasion to urge its importance to the credit of the Government in a financial point of . The great necessity of resorting to every proper and becoming expedient in order to place the Treasury on a footing of the highest respectability is entirely obvious. The credit of the Government may be regarded as the very soul of the Government itselfa principle of vitality without which all its movements are langu and all its operations embarrassed. In this spirit the Executive felt itself bound by the most imperative sense of duty to submit to Congress at its last session the propriety of making a specific pledge of the land fund as the basis for the negotiation of the loans authorized to be contracted. I then thought that such an application of the public domain would without doubt have placed at the command of the Government ample funds to relieve the Treasury from the temporary embarrassments under which it labored. American credit has suffered a conserable shock in Europe from the large indebtedness of the States and the temporary inability of some of them to meet the interest on their debts. The utter and disastrous prostration of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania had contributed largely to increase the sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustained by the holders of its stock a large portion of whom were foreigners and many of whom were alike ignorant of our political organization and of our actual responsibilities.< It was the anxious desire of the Executive that in the effort to negotiate the loan abroad the American negotiator might be able to point the money lender to the fund mortgaged for the redemption of the principal and interest of any loan he might contract and thereby vindicate the Government from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to meet its engagements. Congress differed from the Executive in this  of the subject. It became nevertheless the duty of the Executive to resort to every expedient in its power to do so.< After a failure in the American market a citizen of high character and talent was sent to Europe with no better success; and thus the mortifying spectacle has been presented of the inability of this Government to obtain a loan so small as not in the whole to amount to more than onefourth of its ordinary annual income at a time when the Governments of Europe although involved in debt and with their subjects heavily burthened with taxation readily obtained loans of any amount at a greatly reduced rate of interest. It would be unprofitable to look further into this anomalous state of things but I can not conclude without adding that for a Government which has pa off its debts of two wars with the largest maritime power of Europe and now owing a debt which is almost next to nothing when compared with its boundless resourcesa Government the strongest in the world because emanating from the popular will and firmly rooted in the affections of a great and free people and whose felity to its engagements has never been questionedfor such a Government to have tendered to the capitalists of other countries an opportunity for a small investment in its stock and yet to have failed implies either the most unfounded distrust in its good faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursued is the most fatal which could have been adopted. It has now become obvious to all men that the Government must look to its own means for supplying its wants and it is consoling to know that these means are altogether adequate for the object. The exchequer if adopted will greatly a in bringing about this result. Upon what I regard as a wellrounded supposition that its bills would be readily sought for by the public creditors and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of $15000000 it is obvious that $10000000 would thereby be added to the available means of the Treasury without cost or charge. Nor can I fail to urge the great and beneficial effects which would be produced in a of all the active pursuits of life. Its effects upon the solvent State banks while it would force into liquation those of an opposite character through its weekly settlements would be highly beneficial; and with the advantages of a sound currency the restoration of confence and credit would follow with a numerous train of blessings. My convictions are most strong that these benefits would flow from the adoption of this measure; but if the result should be adverse there is this security in connection with itthat the law creating it may be repealed at the pleasure of the Legislature without the slightest implication of its good faith.< I recommend to Congress to take into conseration the propriety of reimbursing a fine imposed on General Jackson at New Orleans at the time of the attack and defense of that city and pa by him. Without designing any reflection on the judicial tribunal which imposed the fine the remission at this day may be regarded as not unjust or inexpedient. The voice of the civil authority was heard amst the glitter of arms and obeyed by those who held the sword thereby giving additional luster to a memorable military achievement. If the laws were offended their majesty was fully vindicated; and although the penalty incurred and pa is worthy of little regard in a pecuniary point of  it can hardly be doubted that it would be gratifying to the warworn veteran now in retirement and in the winter of his days to be relieved from the circumstances in which that judgment placed him. There are cases in which public aries may be called on to weigh the public interest against their own personal hazards and if the civil law be violated from praiseworthy motives or an overruling sense of public danger and public necessity punishment may well be restrained within that limit which asserts and maintains the authority of the law and the subjection of the military to the civil power. The defense of New Orleans while it saved a city from the hands of the enemy placed the name of General Jackson among those of the greatest captains of the age and illustrated one of the brightest pages of our history. Now that the causes of excitement existing at the time have ceased to operate it is believed that the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification that remission might cause the eminent man who incurred and pa it would be in accordance with the general feeling and wishes of the American people.< I have thus fellowcitizens acquitted myself of my duty under the Constitution by laying before you as succinctly as I have been able the state of the Union and by inviting your attention to measures of much importance to the country. The executive will most zealously unite its efforts with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment of all that is required to relieve the wants of a common constituency or elevate the destinies of a beloved country.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives.< The season for active hostilities in Flora having nearly terminated my attention has necessarily been directed to the course of measures to be pursued hereafter in relation to the few Indians yet remaining in that Territory. Their number is believed not to exceed 240 of whom there are supposed to be about 80 warriors or males capable of bearing arms. The further pursuit of these miserable beings by a large military force seems to be as injudicious as it is uailing. The history of the last year's campaign in Flora has satisfactorily shown that notwithstanding the vigorous and incessant operations of our troops (which can not be exceeded) the Indian mode of warfare their dispersed condition and the very smallness of their number (which increases the difficulty of finding them in the abundant and almost inaccessible hing places of the Territory) render any further attempt to secure them by force impracticable except by the employment of the most expensive means. The exhibition of force and the constant efforts to capture or destroy them of course places them beyond the reach of overtures to surrender. It is believed by the distinguished officer in command there that a different system should now be pursued to attain the entire removal of all the Indians in Flora and he recommends that hostilities should cease unless the renewal of them be rendered necessary by new aggressions; that communications should be opened by means of the Indians with him to insure them a peaceful and voluntary surrender and that the military operations should hereafter be directed to the protection of the inhabitants.< These s are strengthened and corroborated by the governor of the Territory by many of its most intelligent citizens and by numerous officers of the Army who have served and are still serving in that region. Mature reflection has satisfied me that these recommendations are sound and just; and I rejoice that consistently with duty to Flora I may indulge my desire to promote the great interests of humanity and extend the reign of peace and good will by terminating the unhappy warfare that has so long been carried on there and at the same time gratify my anxiety to reduce the demands upon the Treasury by curtailing the extraordinary expenses which have attended the contest. I have therefore authorized the colonel in command there as soon as he shall deem it expedient to declare that hostilities against the Indians have ceased and that they will not be renewed unless provoked and rendered indispensable by new outrages on their part but that neither citizens nor troops are to be restrained from any necessary and proper acts of selfdefense against any attempts to molest them. is instructed to open communications with those yet remaining and endeavor by all peaceable means to persuade them to consult their true interests by joining their brethren at the West; and directions have been given for establishing a cordon or line of protection for the inhabitants by the necessary number of troops.< But to render this system of protection effectual it is essential that settlements of our citizens should be made within the line so established and that they should be armed so as to be ready to repel any attack. In order to afford inducements to such settlements I submit to the conseration of Congress the propriety of allowing a reasonable quantity of land to the head of each family that shall permanently occupy it and of extending the existing provisions on that subject so as to permit the issue of rations for the subsistence of the settlers for one year; and as few of them will probably be proved with arms it would be expedient to authorize the loan of muskets and the delivery of a proper quantity of cartrges or of powder and balls. By such means it is to be hoped that a hardy population will soon occupy the rich soil of the frontiers of Flora who will be as capable as willing to defend themselves and their houses and thus relieve the Government from further anxiety or expense for their protection.< 
To the Senate of the United States:< I have the satisfaction to communicate to the Senate the results of the negotiations recently had in this city with the British minister special and extraordinary.< These results comprise< First. A treaty to settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America for the suppression of the African slave trade and the surrender of criminals fugitive from justice in certain cases.< Second. A correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authorities of the British West Indies with American merchant vessels driven by stress of weather or carried by violence into the ports of those colonies.< Third. A correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat Caroline .< Fourth. A correspondence on the subject of impressment.< If this treaty shall receive the approbation of the Senate it will terminate a difference respecting boundary which has long subsisted between the two Governments has been the subject of several ineffectual attempts at settlement and has sometimes led to great irritation not without danger of disturbing the existing peace. Both the United States and the States more immediately concerned have entertained no doubt of the vality of the American title to all the territory which has been in dispute but that title was controverted and the Government of the United States had agreed to make the dispute a subject of arbitration. One arbitration had been actually had but had failed to settle the controversy and it was found at the commencement of last year that a correspondence had been in progress between the two Governments for a joint commission with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision. That correspondence however had been retarded by various occurrences and had come to no definite result when the special mission of Lord Ashburton was announced. This movement on the part of England afforded in the judgment of the Executive a favorable opportunity for making an attempt to settle this longexisting controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration.< It seemed entirely proper that if this purpose were entertained consultation should be had with the authorities of the States of Maine and Massachusetts. Letters therefore of which copies are herewith communicated were addressed to the governors of those States suggesting that commissioners should be appointed by each of them respectively to repair to this city and confer with the authorities of this Government on a line by agreement or compromise with its equivalents and compensations. This suggestion was met by both States in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly complied with. Four commissioners on the part of Maine and three on the part of Massachusetts all persons of distinction and high character were duly appointed and commissioned and lost no time in presenting themselves at the seat of the Government of the United States. These commissioners have been in correspondence with this Government during the period of the discussions; have enjoyed its confence and freest communications; have aed the general object with their counsel and advice and in the end have unanimously signified their assent to the line proposed in the treaty.< Ordinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interests in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed but the efforts of the Government in attempting to accomplish this desirable object have been seconded and sustained by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the States concerned to which much of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed.< Connected with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary so far as it respects the States of Maine and Massachusetts is the continuation of that line along the highlands to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River. Which of the sources of that stream is entitled to this character has been matter of controversy and of some interest to the State of New Hampshire. The King of the Netherlands deced the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut. This d not satisfy the claim of New Hampshire. The line agreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of Halls Stream and thence down that river embracing the whole claim of New Hampshire and establishing her title to 100000 acres of territory more than she would have had by the decision of the King of the Netherlands.< By the treaty of 1783 the line is to proceed down the Connecticut River to the fortyfifth degree of north latitude and thence west by that parallel till it strikes the St. Lawrence. Recent examinations having ascertained that the line heretofore received as the true line of latitude between those points was erroneous and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the British se a conserable tract of territory heretofore supposed to belong to the States of Vermont and New York but also Rouses Point the site of a military work of the United States it has been regarded as an object of importance not only to establish the rights and jurisdiction of those States up to the line to which they have been consered to extend but also to comprehend Rouses Point within the territory of the United States. The relinquishment by the British Government of all the territory south of the line heretofore consered to be the true line has been obtained and the conseration for this relinquishment is to inure by the provisions of the treaty to the States of Maine and Massachusetts.< The line of boundary then from the source of the St. Croix to the St. Lawrence so far as Maine and Massachusetts are concerned is fixed by their own consent and for conserations satisfactory to them the chief of these conserations being the privilege of transporting the lumber and agricultural products grown and raised in Maine on the waters of the St. Johns and its tributaries down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability. The importance of this privilege perpetual in its terms to a country covered at present by pine forests of great value and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement is not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent men is likely to be ed.< So far as New Hampshire is concerned the treaty secures all that she requires and New York and Vermont are quieted to the extent of their claim and occupation. The difference which would be made in the northern boundary of these two States by correcting the parallel of latitude may be seen on Tanner's maps (1836) new atlas maps Nos. 6 and 9.< From the intersection of the fortyfifth degree of north latitude with the St. Lawrence and along that river and the lakes to the water communication between Lake Huron and Lake Superior the line was definitively agreed on by the commissioners of the two Governments under the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent; but between this lastmentioned point and the Lake of the Woods the commissioners acting under the seventh article of that treaty found several matters of disagreement and therefore made no joint report to their respective Governments. The first of these was Sugar Island or St. Georges Island lying in St. Marys River or the water communication between Lakes Huron and Superior. By the present treaty this island is embraced in the territories of the United States. Both from soil and position it is regarded as of much value.< Another matter of difference was the manner of extending the line from the point at which the commissioners arrived north of Isle Royale in Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods. The British commissioner insisted on proceeding to Fond du Lac at the southwest angle of the lake and thence by the river St. Louis to the Rainy Lake. The American commissioner supposed the true course to be to proceed by way of the Dog River. Attempts were made to compromise this difference but without success. The details of these proceedings are found at length in the printed separate reports of the commissioners.< From the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace some of the descriptions in that treaty do not harmonize with its natural features as now ascertained. Long Lake is nowhere to be found under that name. There is reason for supposing however that the sheet of water intended by that name is the estuary at the mouth of Pigeon River. The present treaty therefore adopts that estuary and river and afterwards pursues the usual route across the height of land by the various portages and small lakes till the line reaches Rainy Lake from which the commissioners agreed on the extension of it to its termination in the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods. The region of country on and near the shore of the lake between Pigeon River on the north and Fond du Lac and the river St. Louis on the south and west consered valuable as a mineral region is thus included within the United States. It embraces a territory of 4000000 acres northward of the claim set up by the British commissioner under the treaty of Ghent. From the height of land at the head of Pigeon River westerly to the Rainy Lake the country is understood to be of little value being described by surveyors and marked on the map as a region of rock and water.< From the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods which is found to be in latitude 45пїЅ 23' 55 north existing treaties require the line to be run due south to its intersection with the fortyfifth parallel and thence along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains.< After sundry informal communications with the British minister upon the subject of the claims of the two countries to territory west of the Rocky Mountains so little probability was found to exist of coming to any agreement on that subject at present that it was not thought expedient to make it one of the subjects of formal negotiation to be entered upon between this Government and the British minister as part of his duties under his special mission.< By the treaty of 1783 the line of ision along the rivers and lakes from the place where the fortyfifth parallel of north latitude strikes the St. Lawrence to the outlet of Lake Superior is invariably to be drawn through the mdle of such waters and not through the mdle of their main channels. Such a line if extended according to the literal terms of the treaty would it is obvious occasionally intersect islands. The manner in which the commissioners of the two Governments dealt with this difficult subject may be seen in their reports. But where the line thus following the mdle of the river or water course d not meet with islands yet it was liable sometimes to leave the only practicable igable channel altogether on one se. The treaty made no provision for the common use of the waters by the citizens and subjects of both countries.< It has happened therefore in a few instances that the use of the river in particular places would be greatly diminished to one party or the other if in fact there was not a choice in the use of channels and passages. Thus at the Long Sault in the St. Lawrencea dangerous passage practicable only for boatsthe only safe run is between the Long Sault Islands and Barnharts Island (all which belong to the United States) on one se and the American shore on the other. On the other hand by far the best passage for vessels of any depth of water from Lake Erie into the Detroit River is between Bois Blanc a British island and the Canadian shore. So again there are several channels or passages of different degrees of facility and usefulness between the several islands in the river St. Clair at or near its entry into the lake of that name. In these three cases the treaty proves that all the several passages and channels shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both parties.< The treaty obligations subsisting between the two countries for the suppression of the African slave trade and the complaints made to this Government within the last three or four years many of them but too well founded of the visitation seizure and detention of American vessels on that coast by British cruisers could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiations which have now been held.< The early and prominent part which the Government of the United States has taken for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic is well known. By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it is declared that the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice and that both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition; and it is thereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object. The Government of the United States has by law declared the African slave trade piracy and at its suggestion other nations have made similar enactments. It has not been wanting in honest and zealous efforts made in conformity with the wishes of the whole country to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slaves upon the African coast but these efforts and those of other countries directed to the same end have proved to a conserable degree unsuccessful. Treaties are known to have been entered into some years ago between England and France by which the former power which usually maintains a large al force on the African station was authorized to seize and bring in for adjudication vessels found engaged in the slave trade under the French flag.< It is known that in December last a treaty was signed in London by the representatives of England France Russia Prussia and Austria having for its professed object a strong and united effort of the five powers to put an end to the traffic. This treaty was not officially communicated to the Government of the United States but its provisions and stipulations are supposed to be accurately known to the public. It is understood to be not yet ratified on the part of France.< No application or request has been made to this Government to become party to this treaty but the course it might take in regard to it has exalted no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe as the principle upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it contains have caused warm animadversions and great political excitement.< In my message at the commencement of the present session of Congress I endeavored to state the principles which this Government supports respecting the right of search and the immunity of flags. Desirous of maintaining those principles fully at the same time that existing obligations should be fulfilled I have thought it most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own laws and perform its own obligations by its own means and its own power.< The examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one nation by the cruisers of another for any purpose except those known and acknowledged by the law of nations under whatever restraints or regulations it may take place may lead to dangerous results. It is far better by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any motive for such examination or visit. Interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interests of inuals. It has been thought therefore expedient not only in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent but at the same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for violating the immunities of the American flag upon the seas as they exist and are defined by the law of nations to enter into the articles now submitted to the Senate.< The treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration mitigation or modification of the rules of the law of nations. It proves simply that each of the two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the laws rights and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the slave trade.< Another conseration of great importance has recommended this mode of fulfilling the duties and obligations of the country. Our commerce along the western coast of Africa is extensive and supposed to be increasing. There is reason to think that in many cases those engaged in it have met with interruptions and annoyances caused by the jealousy and instigation of rivals engaged in the same trade. Many complaints on this subject have reached the Government. A respectable al force on the coast is the natural resort and security against further occurrences of this kind.< The surrender to justice of persons who having committed high crimes seek an asylum in the territories of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belonging to the present state of civilization and intercourse. The British Provinces of North America are separated from the States of the Union by a line of several thousand miles and along portions of this line the amount of population on either se is quite conserable while the passage of the boundary is always easy.< Offenders against the law on the one se transfer themselves to the other. Sometimes with great difficulty they are brought to justice but very often they wholly escape. A consciousness of immunity from the power of avoing justice in this way instigates the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offenses and the peace and good neighborhood of the border are consequently often disturbed.< In the case of offenders fleeing from Canada into the United States the governors of States are often applied to for their surrender and questions of a very embarrassing nature arise from these applications. It has been thought highly important therefore to prove for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation. The article on the subject in the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such offenses as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property. In this careful and specific enumeration of crimes the object has been to exclude all political offenses or criminal charges arising from wars or intestine commotions. Treason misprision of treason libels desertion from military service and other offenses of similar character are excluded.< And lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation rendering its continuance in the opinion of one or both of the parties not longer desirable it is left in the power of either to put an end to it at will.< The destruction of the steamboat Caroline at Schlosser four or five years ago occasioned no small degree of excitement at the time and became the subject of correspondence between the two Governments. That correspondence having been suspended for a conserable period was renewed in the spring of the last year but no satisfactory result having been arrived at it was thought proper though the occurrence had ceased to be fresh and recent not to omit attention to it on the present occasion. It has only been so far discussed in the correspondence now submitted as it was accomplished by a violation of the territory of the United States. The letter of the British minister while he attempts to justify that violation upon the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity admitting nevertheless that even if justifiable an apology was due for it and accompanying this acknowledgment with assurances of the sacred regard of his Government for the inviolability of national territory has seemed to me sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what took place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country. On the subject of the interference of the British authorities in the West Indies a confent hope is entertained that the correspondence which has taken place showing the grounds taken by this Government and the engagements entered into by the British minister will be found such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the United States.< The impressment of seamen from merchant vessels of this country by British cruisers although not practiced in time of peace and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation has nevertheless hitherto been so prominent a topic of controversy and is so likely to bring on renewed contentions at the first breaking out of a European war that it has been thought the part of wisdom now to take it into serious and earnest conseration. The letter from the Secretary of State to the British minister explains the ground which the Government has assumed and the principles which it means to uphold. For the defense of these grounds and the maintenance of these principles the most perfect reliance is placed on the intelligence of the American people and on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touches the honor of the country or its great and essential interests.< JOHN TYLER.< (The following are inserted because they pertain to the treaty transmitted with the message of Present Tyler immediately preceding.) < DEPARTMENT OF STATE Washington August 3 1848.< To the Senate of the United States:< The Secretary of State has the honor to transmit to the Senate in compliance with a resolution adopted by it on the 29th ultimo a copy of the joint report of the commissioners under the treaty of Washington of August 9 1842 together with a copy of the report of the American commissioner transmitting the same to the State Department.< JAMES BUCHANAN.< Mr. Smith to Mr. Buchanan.< WASHINGTON April 20 1848.< SIR: In presenting to you the joint report of the commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9 1842 to survey and mark the line of boundary between the United States and the British Provinces which I have the honor herewith most respectfully to submit I have to perform the painful duty of informing you that the maps of that line and of the adjacent country which had been elaborately constructed by the scientific corps on the part of the United States and contained upon 100 sheets of drawing paper of the largest size together with the tables of the survey have been destroyed by the conflagration of the building in which they were contained. This house had been occupied by Major James D. Graham the head of the scientific corps and principal astronomer of the American commission as his office until his departure for Mexico. All the maps drawings and tables had been completed and duly authenticated by the joint commissioners and were ready to be deposited with their joint report under their hands and seals in the archives of this Government. Of this I had the honor to inform you in my letter of the 24th ultimo.< I can hardly express the pain which this unfortunate event has occasioned me. But I can not perceive that any imputation of blame can properly be attached to any officer of the commission. The care and custody of all the work of the United States scientific corps were properly placed in charge of Major Graham as the head of that corps who had had the immediate direction and superintendence of it from the first organization of the commission. required the maps and tables at his office for reference and revision in the progress of the astronomical work. Upon his departure for Mexico he placed Lieutenant A. W. Whipple in his rooms with an injunction to guard with the utmost care the valuable property of the commission. On the day after he left the city and when for the first time informed of the fact I called upon Lieutenant Whipple and requested him to have all the maps drawings and tables ready to be turned over to the State Department on the following day. On the 24th ultimo I acquainted you with that fact.< No censure can possibly be attributed to Lieutenant Whipple whose great care and attention to all his duties have been on all occasions highly distinguished. escaped from the fire with scarcely an article of his dress and his loss in money and clothing is at least $1000. Major Graham has lost his valuable library together with personal effects to a large amount. The fire was communicated from the basement of the house and by no effort could anything be saved.< There are tracings of the maps upon tissue paper without the topography in the State of Maine but they are not signed by the commissioners.< The field books of the engineers were fortunately not in Major Graham's office and are preserved.< Duplicates of the maps duly authenticated have been placed in the British archives at London which although they have not the topography of the country so fully la down upon them as it was upon our own represent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary itself. Should it be deemed expedient by this Government to procure copies of them access to those archives for that purpose would undoubtedly be permitted and the object accomplished at small expense and when completed these copies could be authenticated by the joint commissioners in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.< I have the honor to be with great respect your obedient and humble servant< ALBERT SMITH.< Report of the Joint commission of boundary appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9 1842.< The undersigned commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington to trace and mark the boundary as directed by that treaty between the British possessions in North America and the United Statesthat is to say James Buckhall Estcourt lieutenantcolonel in the British army appointed commissioner by Her Britannic Majesty and Albert Smith appointed commissioner by the Present of the United Stateshaving accomplished the duty assigned to them do now in accordance with the directions of the sa treaty submit the following report and the accompanying maps jointly signed to their respective Governments.< In obedience to the terms of the treaty the undersigned met at Bangor in the State of Maine on the 1st day of May 1843 where they produced and verified the authority under which they each were respectively to act. They then adjourned because the weather was not sufficiently open for taking the field to the 1st of the following month (June) and agreed to meet again at that time at Houlton.< Accordingly they d meet at that place and began their operations.< It may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of convenience the whole line of boundary marked by the undersigned has been ed in the mention made of the different portions into the following grand isions viz:< North line from the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of the St. John.< River St. John from the intersection of the north line to the mouth of the St. Francis.< River St. Francis from its mouth to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook.< Southwest line from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook to the Northwest Branch of the St. John.< South line from the Northwest Branch to the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25' on the Southwest Branch.< Southwest Branch from the parallel 46пїЅ 25' to its source.< Highlands from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of Halls Stream.< Halls Streams from its source to the intersection of the line of Valentine and Collins.< West line from Halls Stream to the St. Lawrence near St. Regis along the line of Valentine and Collins.< To return to the narration of operations:< The exploring line of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson as directed by the treaty was traced from the monument at the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of the St. John.< The monument found at the source of the St. Croix as described in the report of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson and the course of their exploring line was traced by blazes or marks upon the trees.< An old line cut out by the assistant surveyors of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson was also found which terminated about half a mile north of the South Branch of the Meduxnikeag where by records to which the undersigned referred they ascertained that it had been abandoned because of its deviation from the exploring fine of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson.< After the exploration and remarking of the north line it was cut out 30 feet we. The same was afterwards done in all parts where the boundary passed through woodland. After thus opening the north line it was surveyed and iron posts were erected at intervals to mark it.< The general bearing of the line was rather to the west of the merian of the monument at the source of the St. Croix. The precise line la down by the undersigned was determined by successive courses of which each was made to be as long as was convenient proved it d not pass out of the opening of 30 feet.< At each angle of deflection an iron monument was erected and placed anglewise with the line. Other monuments were erected at the crossing of roads rivers and at every mile commencing from the source of the St. Croix. Those which were not intended to mark angles of deflection were placed square with the line.< At the intersection of the St. John by the north line the river is deep and broad. The boundary rims up the mdle of the channel of the river as indicated by the maps ing the islands as follows:< No. 1. Ryan's Island United States.< No. 2. King's Island United States.< No. 3. Les Trois Isles United States.< No. 4. La Septieme Isle United States.< No. 5. Quissibis Great Britain.< No. 6. La Grand Isle United States.< No. 7. Thibeau's Islands United States.< No. 8.

Savage and Johnson's Island United States.< No. 19. Grew's Island United States.< No. 20. Kendall's Island Great Britain.< The islands were distributed to Great Britain or to the United States as they were found to be on the fight or left of the deep channel. There was but one doubtful case La Septieme Isle and that was apportioned to the United States because the majority of the owners were ascertained to rese on the United States se of the river.< Monuments were erected upon the islands marking them for Great Britain or the United States as the case may have been.< After leaving the St. John the boundary enters the St. Francis ing the islands at the mouth of that river in the manner shown in the maps. It then runs up the St. Francis through the mdle of the lakes upon it to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook the third large lake from the mouth of the river. At the outlet a large monument has been erected.< In order to determine the point on the Northwest Branch to which the treaty directed that a straight line should be run from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook a survey of that stream was made and also of the main St. John in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Northwest Branch and a line was cut between the John and the point on the Northwest Branch ascertained by the survey to be miles in the nearest direction from it and the distance was afterwards verified by chaining.< It was ascertained also in accordance with the provisions of the treaty by a triangulation of the country toward the highlands ing the waters of the St. Lawrence and of the St. John that more than 7 miles intervened between the point selected on the Northwest Branch and the crest of the ing rge. A large iron monument was afterwards erected on the point thus selected and the space around was cleared and sown with grass seed. It is a short distance below the outlet of Lake Ishaganalshegeck.< The outlet of Lake Pohenagamook and the point on the Northwest Branch designated by the treaty having been thus ascertained and marked in the spring of 1844 a straight line was run between them. Along that line which passes entirely through forest monuments were erected at every mile at the crossings of the principal streams and rivers and at the tops of those hills where a transit instrument had been set up to test the straightness of the line.< As soon as the parallel of latitude 46пїЅ 25' had been determined on the Southwest Branch in the early part of the summer of 1844 a straight line
was drawn from the boundary point on the Northwest Branch to a large monument erected on the left bank of the Southwest Branch where it is intersected by the parallel of latitude 46пїЅ 25: The line so drawn crosses the Southwest Branch once before it reaches the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25' and at about half a mile distance from that parallel. There also a large monument has been set up on the left bank.< From the intersection of the parallel 46пїЅ 25' the boundary ascends the Southwest Branch passes through a lake near its head and so up a small stream which falls into the lake from the west to the source of that stream which has been selected as the source of the Southwest Branch.< On the Southwest Branch there are two principal forks at each of which two monuments have been erected one on each bank of the river immediately above the forks and upon the branch established as the boundary. The maps point out their positions. At the mouth of the small stream selected as the source of the Southwest Branch a monument has been erected upon a delta formed by two small outlets. Above those outlets three other monuments have been placed at intervals upon the same stream.< Upon the crest of the ing rge very close to the source of the Southwest Branch a large monument has been erected. It is the first point in the highlands and from it the boundary runs along the crest in a southerly direction passing near to the southeastern shore of the Portage Lake and so on to a large monument erected on a small eminence on the east se of the Kennebec road. Thence it passes through a dwelling house called Tachereau's which was standing there at the time the line was run; so by a tortuous course it runs to the top of Sandy Stream Mountain; thence inclining to the southwest it runs over Hog Back the First as shown in the maps; thence toward Hog Back the Second which it leaves on the north se. Further on at the head of Leech Lake there is a stream which es its waters and flows both into Canada and into the United States. The boundary has been made to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the waters e to a second fork; thence between the streams which unite to form that fork and then to ascend again the ing rge. A monument has been erected at the fork first mentioned where the waters e.< As the boundary approaches the valley of Sper River it bends to the southeast and by a we circuit over high and steep hills it turns the head of Sper River; thence it bends to the northwest until it approaches within about 4 miles of Lake Megantic; thence it turns again south having the valley of Arnolds River on the right and of Dead River on the left. It leaves Gasford Mountain in Canada threads its way over very high ground between the head of Arnolds River and the tributaries of the Magalloway; inclines then to the north so to the west over very rocky mountainous and difficult country leaving Gipps Peak in the United States and turns by a sharp angle at Saddle Back to the south. After that it again inclines to the west and then to the south and again to the west and passes the head of the Connecticut. About 3 miles and a half east of the head of the Connecticut there is a ision of waters similar to that described near Leech Lake. The boundary runs down a stream from near its source to the fork where it es and then again follows the ing rge. The spot is noted on the map.< After the boundary has passed the head of the Connecticut it runs to the northwest descending into very low swampy ground between the heads of Indian Stream and the tributaries of the St. Francis. Thus it passes on bending again to the south of west over a high hill to the source of Halls Stream.< Iron monuments have been erected at intervals along the highlands from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of Halls Stream the position of each of which is shown upon the maps.< From the source of Halls Stream the boundary descends that river ing the islands which are however merely unimportant alluvial deposits in the manner indicated by the maps until it reaches the intersection of that stream by the line formerly run by Valentine and Collins as the fortyfifth degree of north latitude.< At that point a large monument has been erected on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream. Monuments have also been erected along the bank of this stream as indicated on the maps.< The line of Valentine and Collins was explored and found by the blazes still remaining in the original forest.< Upon cutting into those blazes it was seen that deep seated in the tree there was a scar the surface of the original blaze slightly decayed and upon counting the rings (which indicate each year's growth of the tree) it was found that the blazes dated back to 1772 1773 and 1774. The line of Valentine and Collins was run in 1771 1772 1773 and 1774. The coincence of the dates of the blazes with those of the above line confirmed by the testimony of the people of the country satisfied the undersigned that the line they had found was that mentioned in the treaty. Along this portion of the boundary which is known as the fortyfifth degree of Valentine and Collins and which extends from Halls Stream to St. Regis there are several interruptions to the blazes in those parts where clearings have been made and there the authentic marks of the precise situation of the old line have been lost. In those cases the undersigned have drawn the boundary line straight from the original blazes on the one se of a clearing to the original blazes on the other se of the same clearing.< It can not be positively stated that the line as it has been traced through those clearings precisely coinces with the old line but the undersigned believe that it does not differ materially from it; nor have they had the means of determining a nearer or a surer approximation.< Along this line at every point of deflection an iron monument has been erected; also at the crossing of rivers lakes and roads. Those which mark deflections are placed as on the north line anglewise with the line; all the others are placed square with it. The maps show the position of each.< On the eastern shore of Lake Memphremagog an astronomical station was established and on a large flat rock of granite which happened to lie between the astronomical station and the boundary was cut the following inscription:< Capt: Robinson.< Ast: Station< 422 feet north.< British Boundary Merian Line. Commission< Boundary Line< 595 feet south< August 1845.< A mark was cut upon the stone as indicated by the dot upon the merian line above from which these measurements were made.< At Rouses Point a monument of wrought stone was set up at the intersection of the boundary by the merian of the transit instrument used there by Major Graham and an inscription was cut upon it stating the latitude and longitude the names of the observer and his assistant the names of the commissioners and the territories ed.< To mark the position of the instruments used at the following astronomical stations along the west line two monuments within a few feet of each other have been erected at each station and they have been placed on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument as the case may have been.< The stations are: Lake Memphremagog Richford John McCoy's Trout River.< The boundary along the west line though very far from being a straight line is generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of latitude 45пїЅ from Halls Stream to Rouses Point. At about 28 miles west of Rouses Point it however crosses that parallel to the south until it reaches Chateaugay River where it bends northward and crossing the parallel again about 4 miles east of St. Regis it strikes the St. Lawrence 151 feet north of 45пїЅ. At that point a large monument has been erected on the bank of the St. Lawrence. Two large monuments have also been erected one on either se of the river Richelieu near Rouses Point.< No marks of the old line were to be found about St. Regis. It was therefore agreed to run a line due west from the last blaze which should be found in the woods on the east se of St. Regis. That blaze occurred about 1 mile east of the St. Regis River.< The maps which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inches to 1 statute mile consist of 62 consecutive sheets of antiquarian paper as constructed by the British and of 61 as constructed by the American commission. A general map has also been constructed on a scale of 8 miles to 1 inch by the British and of 10 miles to 1 inch by the American commission upon which the beforementioned sheets are represented.< The following portions of the boundary have been la down by the British commission on detached maps on a scale of 12 inches to 1 mile which have been signed by both commissioners:< Grand Falls of the St. John including the intersection of that river by the north line; islands of the St. John; the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook; the turning point of the boundary on the Northwest Branch of the St. John; the intersection of the Southwest Branch by the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25'; the source of the Southwest Branch; the source of Halls Stream; the intersection of Halls Stream by the west line; Rouses Point; St. Regis; Derby.< But similar maps have not been prepared by the American commission because during the interval between the finishing of the maps of the British commission and those of the American it was thought that the maps already constructed upon a scale of 4 inches to 1 mile represented the boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy.< The astronomical observations were begun at the Grand Falls early in June 1843 and were carried up the St. John River to the Northwest Branch by a chain of stations which together with the results obtained are tabulated in the appendix accompanying this report.< From the valley of the St. John an astronomical connection was made with Quebec and thence to Montreal and so to Rouses Point. From Rouses Point a connection was obtained with Cambrge University near Boston.< The astronomical stations on the west line were: Intersection of Halls Stream by the west line Lake Memphremagog Richford Rouses Point John McCoy's Trout River St. Regis.< Latitude was also obtained at an astronomical station established for the purpose at the head of the Connecticut.< Volumes containing the astronomical observations of both commissions are herewith submitted. From them it will be observed that the results for absolute longitude obtained by the British and American astronomers do not agree. It being a difference in no way affecting the survey of the boundary line the undersigned do not feel called upon to attempt to reconcile it. The data upon which those results are based may be seen in the volumes of observations accompanying this report.< In the appendix will be found in a tabular form the following:< An abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the highlands; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the west line; the position of the monuments erected on the Southwest Branch of the St. John and on Halls Stream; the distribution of the islands of the St. John and the monuments on them; the gue lines and offsets run by each commission for the survey of the highlands; the azimuths of verification for the survey of the highlands; the latitudes and longitudes obtained from the astronomical observations; the comparative 1ongitudes obtained and the methods used for the purpose.< Upon comparing the maps of the two commissions it will be seen that the American commission numbers two monuments more than the British. Those are to be found one on the Fourth Island in the river St. John and the other on the highlands between the source of the Southwest Branch of the river St. John and the Kennebec road.< On the maps of the British commission representing the west line the name of the town of  Derby  has been improperly placed north of the line instead of south of it. Also on the same maps the direction of Salmon River near the western extremity of the west line has been incorrectly la down from the boundary line northward. A direction has been given to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly.< The above two corrections the British commissioner is authorized to make on his maps after his return to England.< To avo unnecessary delay in making their joint report the undersigned have attached their signatures to the maps although the lettering of some of the astronomical stations upon the maps of the American commission as well as the alterations before mentioned in the maps of the British commission are yet to be made; but in the maps of both the boundary has been la down accurately and definitively and the undersigned engage that it shall not be altered in any respect.< In conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of boundary described in the foregoing statement has been run marked and surveyed and the accompanying maps faithfully constructed from that survey.< The undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony has subsisted between the two commissions from first to last and that no differences have arisen between the undersigned in the execution of the duties intrusted to them.< Signed and sealed in duplicate at the city of Washington this 28th day of June A.

 Honors To Henry ClayOn the fourth day of July 1776 the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America publicly declared their national independence and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for the maintainance of that declaration. That people were few in numbers and without resources save only their own wise heads and stout hearts. Within the first year of that declared independence and while its maintainance was yet problematicalwhile the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty wouldbemasters was still waging of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay was born. The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together. For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand. They have been companions ever. The nation has passed its perils and is free prosperous and powerful. The child has reached his manhood his mdle age his old age and is dead. In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathised; and now the nation mourns for the man.The day after his death one of the public Journals opposed to him politically held the following pathetic and beautiful language which I adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy originating with a political friend might offend good taste but chiefly because I could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughtsAlas! who can realize that Henry Clay is dead! Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the councilchambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around? Who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceasedthat the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilledthat the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more and the magic of that eloquent tongue which spake as spake no other tongue beses hushedhushed forever! Who can realize that freedom's championthe champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds and people has indeed fallen! Alas in those dark hours which as they come in the history of all nations must come in oursthose hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced and which she may be called to experience againto whom now may her people look up for that council [counsel] and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give and which only the undoubting confence of a nation will receive? Perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fallone while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and his friendbrother friend ever yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them. Ah it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear. We see only the great the grand the noble features of the departed statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherentswe do [not?] beg this permissionwe claim it as a right though we feel it as a privilege. Henry Clay belonged to his countryto the world mere party cannot claim men like him. His career has been nationalhis fame has filled the earthhis memory will endure to `the last syllable of recorded time.'Henry Clay is dead!breathed his last on yesterday at twenty minutes after eleven in his chamber at Washington. To those who followed his lead in public affairs it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious deadbut all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires for his character and fame are national property. As on a question of liberty he knew no North no South no East no West but only the Union which held them all in its sacred circle so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wespread as the bounds of the confederacy. The career of Henry Clay was a public career. From his youth he has been devoted to the public service at a period too in the world's history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs. witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution. saw the rise and fall of Napoleon. was called upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe was the battlefield of contending dynasties and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations. His voice spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain.When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty his name was mingled with the battlecry of freedom. When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar. His name has been and will continue to be hallowed in two hemispheres for it is`One of the few the immortal namesThat were not born to die'To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed. In the effective power to move the heart of man Clay was without an equal and the heaven born endowment in the spirit of its origin has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud. On at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times. And in our last internal discord when this Union trembled to its centerin old age he left the shades of private life and gave the death blow to fraternal strife with the vigor of his earlier years in a series of Senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age. exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic and gave peace to a distracted land. Alas! the achievement cost him his life! sank day by day to the tombhis pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath put there by a grateful country. May his ashes rest in peace while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him!''While it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased; in the case of Mr. Clay it is less necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and rewritten and read and reread for the last twentyfive years; so that with the exception of a few of the latest incents of his life all is as well known as it can be. The short sketch which I give is therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse.Henry Clay was born on the 12th of April 1777 in Hanover county Virginia. Of his father who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's age little seems to be known except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion. Mr. Clay's education to the end of his life was comparatively limited. I say ``to the end of his life'' because I have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life. Mr. Clay's lack of a more perfect early education however it may be regretted generally teaches at least one profitable lesson; it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if he will he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably. In his twentythird year Mr. Clay was licenced to practice law and emigrated to Lexington Kentucky. Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803 when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature. By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806 when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the United States Senate. In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives and by that body chosen its speaker. In 1808 he was reelected to the same body. In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the United States Senate. In 1811 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and on the first day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its speaker. In 1813 he was again elected Speaker. Early in 1814 being the period of our last British war Mr. Clay was sent as commissioner with others to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year. On his return from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress and on taking his seat in December 1815 was called to his old postthe speaker's chair a position in which he was retained by successive elections with one brief intermission till the inauguration of John Q. Adams in March 1825. was then appointed Secretary of State and occupied that important station till the inauguration of Gen. Jackson in March 1829. After this he returned to Kentucky resumed the practice of the law and continued it till the Autumn of 1831 when he was by the Legislature of Kentucky again placed in the United States Senate. By a reelection he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat and retired in March 1842. In December 1849 he again took his seat in the Senate which he again resigned only a few months before his death.By the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Mr. Clay's official life in 1803 to the end of it in 1852 is but one year short of half a century; and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years. But mere duration of time in office constitutes the smallest part of Mr. Clay's history. Throughout that long period he has constantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends and the most dreaded by opponents of all living American politicians. In all the great questions which have agitated the country and particularly in those great and fearful crises the Missouri questionthe Nullification question and the late slavery question as connected with the newly acquired territory involving and endangering the stability of the Union his has been the leading and most conspicuous part. In 1824 he was first a candate for the Presency and was defeated; and although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844 there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the American people d not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the Presency. With other men to be defeated was to be forgotten; but to him defeat was but a trifling incent neither changing him or the world's estimate of him. Even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world. Jackson Van Buren Harrison Polk and Taylor all rose after and set long before him. The spellthe long enduring spellwith which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle. Who can compass it? It is probably true he owed his preeminence to no one quality but to a fortunate combination of several. was surpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail utterly; and they are not as a  generally successful. His judgment was excellent; but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed. His will was indomitable; but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy. These then were Mr. Clay's leading qualities. No one of them is very uncommon; but all taken together are rarely combined in a single inual; and this is probably the reason why such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world.Mr. Clay's eloquence d not consist as many fine specimens of eloquence does [do] of types and figuresof antithesis and elegant arrangement of words and sentences; but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause. This it is that truly touches the chords of human sympathy; and those who heard Mr. Clay never failed to be moved by it or ever afterwards forgot the impression. All his efforts were made for practical effect. never spoke merely to be heard. never delivered a Fourth of July Oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this. As a politician or statesman no one was so habitually careful to avo all sectional ground. Whatever he d he d for the whole country. In the construction of his measures he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field and duly weighed every conflicting interest. Feeling as he d and as the truth surely is that the world's best hope depended on the continued Union of these States he was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them.Mr. Clay's predominant sentiment from first to last was a deep devotion to the cause of human libertya strong sympathy with the oppressed every where and an ardent wish for their elevation. With him this was a primary and all controlling passion. Subsiary to this was the conduct of his whole life. loved his country partly because it was his own country but mostly because it was a free country; and he burned with a zeal for its advancement prosperity and glory because he saw in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature. desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen but chiefly to show to the world that freemen could be prosperous.That his s and measures were always the wisest needs not to be affirmed; nor should it be on this occasion where so many thinking differently join in doing honor to his memory. A free people in times of peace and quietwhen pressed by no common dangernaturally e into parties. At such times the man who is of neither party is notcannot be of any consequence. Mr. Clay therefore was of a party. Taking a prominent part as he d in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen; and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly. But there are many others about his course upon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic Americans. Of these last are the War of 1812 the Missouri question Nullification and the now recent compromise measures. In 1812 Mr. Clay though not unknown was still a young man. Whether we should go to war with Great Britain being the question of the day a minority opposed the declaration of war by Congress while the majority though apparently inclining to war had for years wavered and hesitated to act decisively. Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied and grew more daring and aggravated. By Mr. Clay more than any other man the struggle was brought to a decision in Congress. The question being now fully before congress came up in a variety of ways in rap succession on most of which occasions Mr. Clay spoke. Adding to all the logic of which the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it came to no other he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends and confounded and boredown all opposition. Several of his speeches on these occasions were reported and are still extant; but the best of these all never was. During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocations dropped their pens and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close. The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men; and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing. The precise language of this speech we shall never know; but we do knowwe cannot help knowing that with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured sailorthat it invoked the genius of the revolutionthat it apostrophised the names of Otis of Henry and of Washingtonthat it appealed to the interest the pre the honor and the glory of the nationthat it shamed and taunted the timity of friendsthat it scorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foesthat it bearded and defied the British Lionand rising and swelling and maddening in its course it sounded the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all passed in viv re before the entranced hearers.Important and exciting as was the War question of 1812 it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards d the Missouri question. This sprang from that unfortunate source of discordnegro slavery. When our Federal Constitution was adopted we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states except the territory NorthWest of the River Ohio and East of the Mississippi. What has since been formed into the States of Maine Kentucky and Tennessee was I believe within the limits of or owned by Massachusetts Virginia and North Carolina. As to the North Western Territory provision had been made even before the adoption of the Constitution that slavery should never go there. On the admission of the States into the Union carved from the territory we owned before the constitution no questionor at most no conserable questionarose about slaverythose which were within the limits of or owned by the old states following respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the North West territory following the previously made provision. But in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French; and it included with much more what has since been formed into the State of Missouri. With regard to it nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery. When therefore in 1819 Missouri having formed a State constitution without excluding slavery and with slavery already actually existing within its limits knocked at the door of the Union for admission almost the entire representation of the nonslaveholding states objected. A fearful and angry struggle instantly followed. This alarmed thinking men more than any previous question because unlike all the former it ed the country by geographical lines. Other questions had their opposing partizans in all localities of the country and in almost every family; so that no ision of the Union could follow such without a separation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents. Not so with the Missouri question. On this a geographical line could be traced which in the main would separate opponents only. This was the danger. Mr. Jefferson then in retirement wrote:``I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention to public affairs confent they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant. But this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror. I consered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed indeed for the moment. But this is a reprieve only not a final sentence. A geographical line coincing with a marked principle moral and political once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men will never be obliterated; and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way. The cession of that kind of property for so it is misnamed is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected; and gradually and with due sacrifices I think it might be. But as it is we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale and selfpreservation in the other.''Mr. Clay was in congress and perceiving the danger at once engaged his whole energies to avert it. It began as I have sa in 1819; and it d not terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and congressthat is a majority in congressby repeated votes showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield. After several failures and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission it was by a vote rejected and as all seemed to think finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All felt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union: because those states which already had what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri. All deprecated and deplored this but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet and to answer to.

And if to such a consummation the efforts of Mr. Clay shall have contributed it will be what he most ardently wished and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind.But Henry Clay is dead. His long and eventful life is closed. Our country is prosperous and powerful; but could it have been quite all it has been and is and is to be without Henry Clay? Such a man the times have demanded and such in the provence of God was given us. But he is gone. Let us strive to deserve as far as mortals may the continued care of Divine Provence trusting that in future national emergencies will not fail to prove us the instruments of safety and security. Honors To Henry ClayOn the fourth day of July 1776 the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America publicly declared their national independence and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for the maintainance of that declaration. That people were few in numbers and without resources save only their own wise heads and stout hearts. Within the first year of that declared independence and while its maintainance was yet problematical—while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty wouldbemasters was still waging of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay was born. The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together. For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand. They have been companions ever. The nation has passed its perils and is free prosperous and powerful. The child has reached his manhood his mdle age his old age and is dead. In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathised; and now the nation mourns for the man.The day after his death one of the public Journals opposed to him politically held the following pathetic and beautiful language which I adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy originating with a political friend might offend good taste but chiefly because I could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts—Alas! who can realize that Henry Clay is dead! Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the councilchambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around? Who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased—that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled—that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more and the magic of that eloquent tongue which spake as spake no other tongue beses hushed—hushed forever! Who can realize that freedom's champion—the champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds and people has indeed fallen! Alas in those dark hours which as they come in the history of all nations must come in ours—those hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced and which she may be called to experience again—to whom now may her people look up for that council and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give and which only the undoubting confence of a nation will receive? Perchance in the who
e circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall—one while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and his friend—brother friend ever yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them. Ah it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear. We see only the great the grand the noble features of the departed statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents—we do [not?] beg this permission—we claim it as a right though we feel it as a privilege. Henry Clay belonged to his country—to the world mere party cannot claim men like him. His career has been national—his fame has filled the earth—his memory will endure to `the last syllable of recorded time.'Henry Clay is dead!—breathed his last on yesterday at twenty minutes after eleven in his chamber at Washington. To those who followed his lead in public affairs it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead—but all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires for his character and fame are national property. As on a question of liberty he knew no North no South no East no West but only the Union which held them all in its sacred circle so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wespread as the bounds of the confederacy. The career of Henry Clay was a public career. From his youth he has been devoted to the public service at a period too in the world's history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs. witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution. saw the rise and fall of Napoleon. was called upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe was the battlefield of contending dynasties and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations. His voice spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain.When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty his name was mingled with the battlecry of freedom. When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar. His name has been and will continue to be hallowed in two hemispheres for it is—`One of the few the immortal namesThat were not born to die'To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed. In the effective power to move the heart of man Clay was without an equal and the heaven born endowment in the spirit of its origin has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud. On at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times. And in our last internal discord when this Union trembled to its center—in old age he left the shades of private life and gave the death blow to fraternal strife with the vigor of his earlier years in a series of Senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age. exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic and gave peace to a distracted land. Alas! the achievement cost him his life! sank day by day to the tomb—his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath put there by a grateful country. May his ashes rest in peace while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him!While it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased; in the case of Mr. Clay it is less necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and rewritten and read and reread for the last twentyfive years; so that with the exception of a few of the latest incents of his life all is as well known as it can be. The short sketch which I give is therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse.Henry Clay was born on the 12th of April 1777 in Hanover county Virginia. Of his father who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's age little seems to be known except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion. Mr. Clay's education to the end of his life was comparatively limited. I say to the end of his life because I have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life. Mr. Clay's lack of a more perfect early education however it may be regretted generally teaches at least one profitable lesson; it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if he will he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably. In his twentythird year Mr. Clay was licenced to practice law and emigrated to Lexington Kentucky. Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803 when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature. By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806 when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the United States Senate. In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives and by that body chosen its speaker. In 1808 he was reelected to the same body. In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the United States Senate. In 1811 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and on the first day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its speaker. In 1813 he was again elected Speaker. Early in 1814 being the period of our last British war Mr. Clay was sent as commissioner with others to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year. On his return from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress and on taking his seat in December 1815 was called to his old postthe speaker's chair a position in which he was retained by successive elections with one brief intermission till the inauguration of John Q. Adams in March 1825. was then appointed Secretary of State and occupied that important station till the inauguration of Gen. Jackson in March 1829. After this he returned to Kentucky resumed the practice of the law and continued it till the Autumn of 1831 when he was by the Legislature of Kentucky again placed in the United States Senate. By a reelection he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat and retired in March 1842. In December 1849 he again took his seat in the Senate which he again resigned only a few months before his death.By the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Mr. Clay's official life in 1803 to the end of it in 1852 is but one year short of half a century; and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years. But mere duration of time in office constitutes the smallest part of Mr. Clay's history. Throughout that long period he has constantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends and the most dreaded by opponents of all living American politicians. In all the great questions which have agitated the country and particularly in those great and fearful crises the Missouri question—the Nullification question and the late slavery question as connected with the newly acquired territory involving and endangering the stability of the Union his has been the leading and most conspicuous part. In 1824 he was first a candate for the Presency and was defeated; and although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844 there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the American people d not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the Presency. With other men to be defeated was to be forgotten; but to him defeat was but a trifling incent neither changing him or the world's estimate of him. Even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world. Jackson Van Buren Harrison Polk and Taylor all rose after and set long before him. The spell—the long enduring spell—with which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle. Who can compass it? It is probably true he owed his preeminence to no one quality but to a fortunate combination of several. was surpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail utterly; and they are not as a  generally successful. His judgment was excellent; but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed. His will was indomitable; but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy. These then were Mr. Clay's leading qualities. No one of them is very uncommon; but all taken together are rarely combined in a single inual; and this is probably the reason why such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world.Mr. Clay's eloquence d not consist as many fine specimens of eloquence does of types and figures—of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words and sentences; but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause. This it is that truly touches the chords of human sympathy; and those who heard Mr. Clay never failed to be moved by it or ever afterwards forgot the impression. All his efforts were made for practical effect. never spoke merely to be heard. never delivered a Fourth of July Oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this. As a politician or statesman no one was so habitually careful to avo all sectional ground. Whatever he d he d for the whole country. In the construction of his measures he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field and duly weighed every conflicting interest. Feeling as he d and as the truth surely is that the world's best hope depended on the continued Union of these States he was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them.Mr. Clay's predominant sentiment from first to last was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty—a strong sympathy with the oppressed every where and an ardent wish for their elevation. With him this was a primary and all controlling passion. Subsiary to this was the conduct of his whole life. loved his country partly because it was his own country but mostly because it was a free country; and he burned with a zeal for its advancement prosperity and glory because he saw in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature. desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen but chiefly to show to the world that freemen could be prosperous.That his s and measures were always the wisest needs not to be affirmed; nor should it be on this occasion where so many thinking differently join in doing honor to his memory. A free people in times of peace and quietwhen pressed by no common danger—naturally e into parties. At such times the man who is of neither party is not—cannot be of any consequence. Mr. Clay therefore was of a party. Taking a prominent part as he d in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen; and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly. But there are many others about his course upon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic Americans. Of these last are the War of 1812 the Missouri question Nullification and the now recent compromise measures. In 1812 Mr. Clay though not unknown was still a young man. Whether we should go to war with Great Britain being the question of the day a minority opposed the declaration of war by Congress while the majority though apparently inclining to war had for years wavered and hesitated to act decisively. Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied and grew more daring and aggravated. By Mr. Clay more than any other man the struggle was brought to a decision in Congress. The question being now fully before congress came up in a variety of ways in rap succession on most of which occasions Mr. Clay spoke. Adding to all the logic of which the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it came to no other he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends and confounded and boredown all opposition. Several of his speeches on these occasions were reported and are still extant; but the best of these all never was. During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocations dropped their pens and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close. The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men; and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing. The precise language of this speech we shall never know; but we do know—we cannot help knowing that with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor—that it invoked the genius of the revolutionthat it apostrophised the names of Otis of Henry and of Washington—that it appealed to the interest the pre the honor and the glory of the nation—that it shamed and taunted the timity of friends—that it scorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes—that it bearded and defied the British Lion—and rising and swelling and maddening in its course it sounded the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all passed in viv re before the entranced hearers.Important and exciting as was the War question of 1812 it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards d the Missouri question. This sprang from that unfortunate source of discord—negro slavery. When our Federal Constitution was adopted we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states except the territory NorthWest of the River Ohio and East of the Mississippi. What has since been formed into the States of Maine Kentucky and Tennessee was I believe within the limits of or owned by Massachusetts Virginia and North Carolina. As to the North Western Territory provision had been made even before the adoption of the Constitution that slavery should never go there. On the admission of the States into the Union carved from the territory we owned before the constitution no question—or at most no conserable question—arose about slavery—those which were within the limits of or owned by the old states following respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the North West territory following the previously made provision. But in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French; and it included with much more what has since been formed into the State of Missouri. With regard to it nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery. When therefore in 1819 Missouri having formed a State constitution without excluding slavery and with slavery already actually existing within its limits knocked at the door of the Union for admission almost the entire representation of the nonslaveholding states objected. A fearful and angry struggle instantly followed. This alarmed thinking men more than any previous question because unlike all the former it ed the country by geographical lines. Other questions had their opposing partizans in all localities of the country and in almost every family; so that no ision of the Union could follow such without a separation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents. Not so with the Missouri question. On this a geographical line could be traced which in the main would separate opponents only. This was the danger. Mr. Jefferson then in retirement wrote:I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention to public affairs confent they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant. But this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror. I consered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed indeed for the moment. But this is a reprieve only not a final sentence. A geographical line coincing with a marked principle moral and political once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men will never be obliterated; and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way. The cession of that kind of property for so it is misnamed is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected; and gradually and with due sacrifices I think it might be. But as it is we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale and selfpreservation in the other.Mr. Clay was in congress and perceiving the danger at once engaged his whole energies to avert it. It began as I have sa in 1819; and it d not terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and congress—that is a majority in congress—by repeated votes showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield. After several failures and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission it was by a vote rejected and as all seemed to think finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All felt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union: because those states which already had what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri. All deprecated and deplored this but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet and to answer to. Mr. Clay though worn down and exhausted was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise. d so and by some judicious modifications of his plan coupled with laborious efforts with inual members and his own overmastering eloquence upon the floor he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly and captivating as it had previously shown it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril.After the settlement of the Missouri question although a portion of the American people have differed with Mr. Clay and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for a crisis. Accordingly in the days of Nullification and more recently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent—and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation.Mr. Clay's efforts in behalf of the South Americans and afterwards in behalf of the Greeks in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty are among the finest on record upon the noblest of all themes; and bear ample corroboration of what I have sa was his ruling passion—a love of liberty and right unselfishly and for their own sakes.Having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already I am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to Mr. Clay's s and conduct in regard to it. ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery.

But I would also if I could array his name opinions and influence against the opposite extreme—against a few but an increasing number of men who for the sake of perpetuating slavery are beginning to assail and to ricule the whiteman's charter of freedom—the declaration that all men are created free and equal.

Let us strive to deserve as far as mortals may the continued care of Divine Provence trusting that in future national emergencies will not fail to prove us the instruments of safety and security.  
To the People of the United States< FELLOWCITIZENS: Before my arrival at the seat of Government the painful communication was made to you by the officers presing over the several Departments of the deeply regretted death of William Henry Harrison late Present of the United States. Upon him you had conferred your suffrages for the first office in your gift and had selected him as your chosen instrument to correct and reform all such errors and abuses as had manifested themselves from time to time in the practical operation of the Government. While standing at the threshold of this great work he has by the dispensation of an allwise Provence been removed from amongst us and by the provisions of the Constitution the efforts to be directed to the accomplishing of this vitally important task have devolved upon myself. This same occurrence has subjected the wisdom and sufficiency of our institutions to a new test. For the first time in our history the person elected to the VicePresency of the United States by the happening of a contingency proved for in the Constitution has had devolved upon him the Presential office. The spirit of faction which is directly opposed to the spirit of a lofty patriotism may find in this occasion for assaults upon my Administration; and in succeeding under circumstances so sudden and unexpected and to responsibilities so greatly augmented to the administration of public affairs I shall place in the intelligence and patriotism of the people my only sure reliance. My earnest prayer shall be constantly addressed to the allwise and allpowerful Being who made me and by whose dispensation I am called to the high office of Present of this Confederacy understandingly to carry out the principles of that Constitution which I have sworn to protect preserve and defend.< The usual opportunity which is afforded to a Chief Magistrate upon his induction to office of presenting to his countrymen an exposition of the policy which would gue his Administration in the form of an inaugural address not having under the peculiar circumstances which have brought me to the discharge of the high duties of Present of the United States been afforded to me a brief exposition of the principles which will govern me in the general course of my administration of public affairs would seem to be due as well to myself as to you.< In regard to foreign nations the groundwork of my policy will be justice on our part to all submitting to injustice from none. While I shall sedulously cultivate the relations of peace and amity with one and all it will be my most imperative duty to see that the honor of the country shall sustain no blemish. With a  to this the condition of our military defenses will become a matter of anxious solicitude. The Army which has in other days covered itself with renown and the Navy not inappropriately termed the right arm of the public defense which has spread a light of glory over the American standard in all the waters of the earth should be rendered replete with efficiency.< In  of the fact well avouched by history that the tendency of all human institutions is to concentrate power in the hands of a single man and that their ultimate downfall has proceeded from this cause I deem it of the most essential importance that a complete separation should take place between the sword and the purse. No matter where or how the public moneys shall be deposited so long as the Present can exert the power of appointing and removing at his pleasure the agents selected for their custody the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy is in fact the treasurer. A permanent and radical change should therefore be decreed. The patronage incent to the Presential office already great is constantly increasing. Such increase is destined to keep pace with the growth of our population until without a figure of speech an army of officeholders may be spread over the land. The unrestrained power exerted by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate his authority or to hand it over to some favorite as his successor may lead to the employment of all the means within his control to accomplish his object. The right to remove from office while subjected to no just restraint is inevitably destined to produce a spirit of crouching servility with the official corps which in order to uphold the hand which feeds them would lead to direct and active interference in the elections both State and Federal thereby subjecting the course of State legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and making the will of that officer absolute and supreme. I will at a proper time invoke the action of Congress upon this subject and shall readily acquiesce in the adoption of all proper measures which are calculated to arrest these evils so full of danger in their tendency. I will remove no incumbent from office who has faithfully and honestly acquitted himself of the duties of his office except in such cases where such officer has been guilty of an active partisanship or by secret meansthe less manly and therefore the more objectionable has given his official influence to the purposes of party thereby bringing the patronage of the Government in conflict with the freedom of elections. Numerous removals may become necessary under this rule. These will be made by me through no acerbity of feelingI have had no cause to cherish or indulge unkind feelings toward anybut my conduct will be regulated by a profound sense of what is due to the country and its institutions; nor shall I neglect to apply the same unbending rule to those of my own appointment. Freedom of opinion will be tolerated the full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintained as the birthright of every American citizen; but I say emphatically to the official corps Thus far and no farther. I have dwelt the longer upon this subject because removals from office are likely often to arise and I would have my countrymen to understand the principle of the Executive action.< In all public expenditures the most rig economy should be resorted to and as one of its results a public debt in time of peace be sedulously avoed. A wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the imposition of necessary burdens for useful ends and true wisdom dictates the resort to such means in order to supply deficiencies in the revenue rather than to those doubtful expedients which ultimating in a public debt serve to embarrass the resources of the country and to lessen its ability to meet any great emergency which may arise. All sinecures should be abolished. The appropriations should be direct and explicit so as to leave as limited a share of discretion to the disbursing agents as may be found compatible with the public service. A strict responsibility on the part of all the agents of the Government should be maintained and peculation or defalcation visited with immediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment.< The public interest also demands that if any war has existed between the Government and the currency it shall cease. Measures of a financial character now having the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully enforced until repealed by the legislative authority. But I owe it to myself to declare that I regard existing enactments as unwise and impolitic and in a high degree oppressive. I shall promptly give my sanction to any constitutional measure which originating in Congress shall have for its object the restoration of a sound circulating medium so essentially necessary to give confence in all the transactions of life to secure to industry its just and adequate rewards and to reestablish the public prosperity. In decing upon the adaptation of any such measure to the end proposed as well as its conformity to the Constitution I shall resort to the fathers of the great republican school for advice and instruction to be drawn from their sage s of our system of government and the light of their everglorious example.< The institutions under which we live my countrymen secure each person in the perfect enjoyment of all his rights. The spectacle is exhibited to the world of a government deriving its powers from the consent of the governed and having imparted to it only so much power as is necessary for its successful operation. Those who are charged with its administration should carefully abstain from all attempts to enlarge the range of powers thus granted to the several departments of the Government other than by an appeal to the people for additional grants lest by so doing they disturb that balance which the patriots and statesmen who framed the Constitution designed to establish between the Federal Government and the States composing the Union. The observance of these rules is enjoined upon us by that feeling of reverence and affection which finds a place in the heart of every patriot for the preservation of union and the blessings of unionfor the good of our children and our children's children through countless generations. An opposite course could not fail to generate factions intent upon the gratification of their selfish ends to give birth to local and sectional jealousies and to ultimate either in breaking asunder the bonds of union or in building up a central system which would inevitably end in a bloody scepter and an iron crown.< In conclusion I beg you to be assured that I shall exert myself to carry the foregoing principles into practice during my administration of the Government and confing in the protecting care of an everwatchful and overruling Provence it shall be my first and highest duty to preserve unimpaired the free institutions under which we live and transmit them to those who shall succeed me in their full force and vigor.< 
To the Senate of the United States:< I transmit to the Senate in answer to a resolution of that body passed on the 17th instant the accompanying reports of heads of Departments which contain all the official information in the possession of the Executive asked for by the resolution.< On coming into office I found the military commandant of the Department of California exercising the s of civil governor in that Territory and left as I was to act under the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo without the a of any legislative provision establishing a government in that Territory I thought it best not to disturb that arrangement made under my predecessor until Congress should take some action on that subject. I therefore d not interfere with the powers of the military commandant who continued to exercise the s of civil governor as before; but I made no such appointment conferred no such authority and have allowed no increased compensation to the commandant for his services.< With a  to the faithful execution of the treaty so far as lay in the power of the Executive and to enable Congress to act at the present session with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible on all matters of interest in these Territories I sent the Hon. Thomas Butler King as bearer of dispatches to California and certain officers to California and New Mexico whose duties are particularly defined in the accompanying letters of instruction addressed to them severally by the proper Departments.< I d not hesitate to express to the people of those Territories my desire that each Territory should if prepared to comply with the requisitions of the Constitution of the United States form a plan of a State constitution and submit the same to Congress with a prayer for admission into the Union as a State but I d not anticipate suggest or authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent of Congress nor d I authorize any Government agent or officer to interfere with or exercise any influence or control over the election of delegates or over any convention in making or modifying their domestic institutions or any of the provisions of their proposed constitution. On the contrary the instructions given by my orders were that all measures of domestic policy adopted by the people of California must originate solely with themselves; that while the Executive of the United States was desirous to protect them in the formation of any government republican in its character to be at the proper time submitted to Congress yet it was to be distinctly understood that the plan of such a government must at the same time be the result of their own deliberate choice and originate with themselves without the interference of the Executive.< I am unable to give any information as to laws passed by any supposed government in California or of any census taken in either of the Territories mentioned in the resolution as I have no information on those subjects.< As already stated I have not disturbed the arrangements which I found had existed under my predecessor.< In advising an early application by the people of these Territories for admission as States I was actuated principally by an earnest desire to afford to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress the opportunity of avoing occasions of bitter and angry dissensions among the people of the United States.< Under the Constitution every State has the right of establishing and from time to time altering its municipal laws and domestic institutions independently of every other State and of the General Government subject only to the prohibitions and guaranties expressly set forth in the Constitution of the United States. The subjects thus left exclusively to the respective States were not designed or expected to become topics of national agitation. Still as under the Constitution Congress has power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the Territories of the United States every new acquisition of territory has led to discussions on the question whether the system of involuntary servitude which prevails in many of the States should or should not be prohibited in that territory. The periods of excitement from this cause which have heretofore occurred have been safely passed but during the interval of whatever length which may elapse before the admission of the Territories ceded by Mexico as States it appears probable that similar excitement will prevail to an undue extent.< Under these circumstances I thought and still think that it was my duty to endeavor to put it in the power of Congress by the admission of California and New Mexico as States to remove all occasion for the unnecessary agitation of the public mind.< It is understood that the people of the western part of California have formed a plan of a State constitution and will soon submit the same to the judgment of Congress and apply for admission as a State. This course on their part though in accordance with was not adopted exclusively in consequence of any expression of my wishes inasmuch as measures tending to this end had been promoted by the officers sent there by my predecessor and were already in active progress of execution before any communication from me reached California. If the proposed constitution shall when submitted to Congress be found to be in compliance with the requisitions of the Constitution of the United States I earnestly recommend that it may receive the sanction of Congress.< The part of California not included in the proposed State of that name is believed to be uninhabited except in a settlement of our countrymen in the vicinity of Salt Lake.< A claim has been advanced by the State of Texas to a very large portion of the most populous district of the Territory commonly designated by the name of New Mexico. If the people of New Mexico had formed a plan of a State government for that Territory as ceded by the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo and had been admitted by Congress as a State our Constitution would have afforded the means of obtaining an adjustment of the question of boundary with Texas by a judicial decision. At present however no judicial tribunal has the power of decing that question and it remains for Congress to devise some mode for its adjustment. Meanwhile I submit to Congress the question whether it would be expedient before such adjustment to establish a Territorial government which by including the district so claimed would practically dece the question adversely to the State of Texas or by excluding it would dece it in her favor. In my opinion such a course would not be expedient especially as the people of this Territory still enjoy the benefit and protection of their municipal laws originally derived from Mexico and have a military force stationed there to protect them against the Indians. It is undoubtedly true that the property lives liberties and religion of the people of New Mexico are better protected than they ever were before the treaty of cession.< Should Congress when California shall present herself for incorporation into the Union annex a condition to her admission as a State affecting her domestic institutions contrary to the wishes of her people and even compel her temporarily to comply with it yet the State could change her constitution at any time after admission when to her it should seem expedient. Any attempt to deny to the people of the State the right of selfgovernment in a matter which peculiarly affects themselves will infallibly be regarded by them as an invasion of their rights and upon the principles la down in our own Declaration of Independence they will certainly be sustained by the great mass of the American people. To assert that they are a conquered people and must as a State submit to the will of their conquerors in this regard will meet with no cordial response among American freemen. Great numbers of them are native citizens of the United States not inferior to the rest of our countrymen in intelligence and patriotism and no language of menace to restrain them in the exercise of an undoubted right substantially guaranteed to them by the treaty of cession itself shall ever be uttered by me or encouraged and sustained by persons acting under my authority. It is to be expected that in the resue of the territory ceded to us by Mexico the people resing there will at the time of their incorporation into the Union as a State settle all questions of domestic policy to suit themselves.< No material inconvenience will result from the want for a short period of a government established by Congress over that part of the territory which lies eastward of the new State of California; and the reasons for my opinion that New Mexico will at no very distant period ask for admission into the Union are rounded on unofficial information which I suppose is common to all who have cared to make inquiries on that subject.< Seeing then that the question which now excites such painful sensations in the country will in the end certainly be settled by the silent effect of causes independent of the action of Congress I again submit to your wisdom the policy recommended in my annual message of awaiting the salutary operation of those causes believing that we shall thus avo the creation of geographical parties and secure the harmony of feeling so necessary to the beneficial action of our political system. Connected as the Union is with the remembrance of past happiness the sense of present blessings and the hope of future peace and prosperity every dictate of wisdom every feeling of duty and every emotion of patriotism tend to inspire felity and devotion to it and admonish us cautiously to avo any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger it or impair its strength the chief element of which is to be found in the regard and affection of the people for each other.< 
Elected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws I appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution and in compliance with a timehonored custom to address those who are now assembled.  The confence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be the Chief Magistrate of a Republic holding a high rank among the nations of the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude; but when I reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous duties and involves the weightiest obligations I am conscious that the position which I have been called to fill though sufficient to satisfy the loftiest ambition is surrounded by fearful responsibilities. Happily however in the performance of my new duties I shall not be without able cooperation. The legislative and judicial branches of the Government present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments and matured experience and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the Executive Departments inuals whose talents integrity and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the faithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to their charge. With such as and an honest purpose to do whatever is right I hope to execute diligently impartially and for the best interests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me.  In the discharge of these duties my gue will be the Constitution which I this day swear to preserve protect and defend. For the interpretation of that instrument I shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of the Government under the earlier Presents who had so large a share in its formation. To the example of those illustrious patriots I shall always defer with reverenceand especially to his example who was by so many titles the Father of his Country.  To command the Army and Navy of the United States; with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other officers; to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary; and to take care that the laws shall be faithfully executedthese are the most important s entrusted to the Present by the Constitution and it may be expected that I shall briefly indicate the principles which will control me in their execution.  Chosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my Administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest I this day renew the declarations I have heretofore made and proclaim my fixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the Government in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public policy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of our national existence.  In reference to the Army and Navy lately employed with so much distinction on active service care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency and in furtherance of that object the military and al schools sustained by the liberality of Congress shall receive the special attention of the Executive.  As American freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty but at the same time we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations. In all disputes between conflicting governments it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral while our geographical position the genius of our institutions and our people the advancing spirit of civilizationand above all the dictates of religion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations with all other powers. It is to be hoped that no international question can now arise which a government confent in its own strength and resolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise negotiation; and it eminently becomes a government like our own founded on the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their affections to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before appealing to arms. In the conduct of our foreign relations I shall conform to these s as I believe them essential to the best interests and the true honor of the country.  The appointing power vested in the Present imposes delicate and onerous duties. So far as it is possible to be informed I shall make honestycapacity and felity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of officeand the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal.  It shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to Congress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and protection to the great interests of agriculture commerce and manufactures to improve our rivers and harbors to prove for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all officers of the Government and the utmost economy in all public expenditures; but it is for the wisdom of Congress itself in which all legislative powers are vested by the Constitution to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy. I shall look with confence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that Union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections. In any action calculated to promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his country I will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the Government.  In conclusion I congratulate you my fellowcitizens upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of Divine Provence has conducted our common country. Let us invoke a continuance of the same protecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence we this day occupy and let us seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our councils by welldirected attempts to assuage the bitterness which too often marks uoable differences of opinion by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal principles and by an enlarged patriotismwhich shall acknowledge no limits but those of our own wespread Republic.  
To the Senate of the United States:< The bill entitled An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Fiscal Bank of the United States which originated in the Senate has been consered by me with a sincere desire to conform my action in regard to it to that of the two Houses of Congress. By the Constitution it is made my duty either to approve the bill by signing it or to return it with my objections to the House in which it originated. I can not conscientiously give it my approval and I proceed to discharge the duty required of me by the Constitutionto give my reasons for disapproving.< The power of Congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the Union has been a question of dispute from the origin of the Government. Men most justly and deservedly esteemed for their high intellectual endowments their virtue and their patriotism have in regard to it entertained different and conflicting opinions; Congresses have differed; the approval of one Present has been followed by the disapproval of another; the people at different times have acquiesced in decisions both for and against. The country has been and still is deeply agitated by this unsettled question. It will suffice for me to say that my own opinion has been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise of any such power by this Government. On all suitable occasions during a period of twentyfive years the opinion thus entertained has been unreservedly expressed. I declared it in the legislature of my native State; in the House of Representatives of the United States it has been openly vindicated by me; in the Senate Chamber in the presence and hearing of many who are at this time members of that body it has been affirmed and reaffirmed in speeches and reports there made and by votes there recorded; in popular assemblies I have unhesitatingly announced it and the last public declaration which I madeand that but a short time before the late Presential electionI referred to my previously expressed opinions as being those then entertained by me. With a full knowledge of the opinions thus entertained and never concealed I was elected by the people VicePresent of the United States. By the occurrence of a contingency proved for in the Constitution and arising under an impressive dispensation of Provence I succeeded to the Presential office. Before entering upon the duties of that office I took an oath that I would preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Entertaining the opinions alluded to and having taken this oath the Senate and the country will see that I could not give my sanction to a measure of the character described without surrendering all claim to the respect of honorable men all confence on the part of the people all selfrespect all regard for moral and religious obligations without an observance of which no government can be prosperous and no people can be happy. It would be to commit a crime which I would not willfully commit to gain any earthly reward and which would justly subject me to the ricule and scorn of all virtuous men.< I deem it entirely unnecessary at this time to enter upon the reasons which have brought my mind to the convictions I feel and entertain on this subject. They have been over and over again repeated. If some of those who have preceded me in this high office have entertained and avowed different opinions I yield all confence that their convictions were sincere. I claim only to have the same measure meted out to myself. Without going further into the argument I will say that in looking to the powers of this Government to collect safely keep and disburse the public revenue and incentally to regulate the commerce and exchanges I have not been able to satisfy myself that the establishment by this Government of a bank of discount in the ordinary acceptation of that term was a necessary means or one demanded by propriety to execute those powers. What can the local discounts of the bank have to do with the collecting safekeeping and disbursing of the revenue? So far as the mere discounting of paper is concerned it is quite immaterial to this question whether the discount is obtained at a State bank or a United States bank. They are both equally local both beginning and both ending in a local accommodation. What influence have local discounts granted by any form of bank in the regulating of the currency and the exchanges? Let the history of the late United States Bank a us in answering this inquiry.< For several years after the establishment of that institution it dealt almost exclusively in local discounts and during that period the country was for the most part disappointed in the consequences anticipated from its incorporation. A uniform currency was not proved exchanges were not regulated and little or nothing was added to the general circulation and in 1920 its embarrassments had become so great that the directors petitioned Congress to repeal that article of the charter which made its notes receivable everywhere in payment of the public dues. It had up to that period dealt to but a very small extent in exchanges either foreign or domestic and as late as 1823 its operations in that line amounted to a little more than $7000000 per annum. A very rap augmentation soon after occurred and in 1833 its dealings in the exchanges amounted to upward of $100000000 including the sales of its own drafts; and all these immense transactions were effected without the employment of extraordinary means. The currency of the country became sound and the negotiations in the exchanges were carried on at the lowest possible rates. The circulation was increased to more than $22000000 and the notes of the bank were regarded as equal to specie all over the country thus showing almost conclusively that it was the capacity to deal in exchanges and not in local discounts which furnished these facilities and advantages. It may be remarked too that notwithstanding the immense transactions of the bank in the purchase of exchange the losses sustained were merely nominal while in the line of discounts the suspended debt was enormous and proved most disastrous to the bank and the country. Its power of local discount has in fact proved to be a fruitful source of favoritism and corruption alike destructive to the public morals and to the general weal.< The capital invested in banks of discount in the United States created by the States at this time exceeds $350000000 and if the discounting of local paper could have produced any beneficial effects the United States ought to possess the soundest currency in the world; but the reverse is lamentably the fact.< Is the measure now under conseration of the objectionable character to which I have alluded? It is clearly so unless by the sixteenth fundamental article of the eleventh section it is made otherwise. That article is in the following words:< The directors of the sa corporation shall establish one competent office of discount and deposit in any State in which two thousand shares shall have been subscribed or may be held whenever upon application of the legislature of such State Congress may by law require the same. And the sa directors may also establish one or more competent offices of discount and deposit in any Territory or District of the United States and in any State with the assent of such State and when established the sa office or offices shall be only withdrawn or removed by the sa directors prior to the expiration of this charter with the previous assent of Congress: Proved  In respect to any State which shall not at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within it such assent of the sa State shall be thereafter presumed: And proved nevertheless  That whenever it shall become necessary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers granted by the Constitution to establish an office or offices in any of the States whatever and the establishment thereof shall be directed by law it shall be the duty of the sa directors to establish such office or offices accordingly.< It will be seen that by this clause the directors are invested with the fullest power to establish a branch in any State which has yielded its assent; and having once established such branch it shall not afterwards be withdrawn except by order of Congress. Such assent is to be implied and to have the force and sanction of an actually expressed assent proved in respect to any State which shall not at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within it such assent of sa State shall be thereafter presumed. The assent or dissent is to be expressed unconditionally at the first session of the legislature by some formal legislative act; and if not so expressed its assent is to be implied and the directors are thereupon invested with power at such time thereafter as they may please to establish branches which can not afterwards be withdrawn except by resolve of Congress. No matter what may be the cause which may operate with the legislature which either prevents it from speaking or addresses itself to its wisdom to induce delay its assent is to be implied. This iron rule is to give way to no circumstances; it is unbending and inflexible. It is the language of the master to the vassal; an unconditional answer is claimed forthwith and delay postponement or incapacity to answer produces an implied assent which is ever after irrevocable. Many of the State elections have already taken place without any knowledge on the part of the people that such a question was to come up. The representatives may desire a submission of the question to their constituents preparatory to final action upon it but this high privilege is denied; whatever may be the motives and s entertained by the representatives of the people to induce delay their assent is to be presumed and is ever afterwards binding unless their dissent shall be unconditionally expressed at their first session after the passage of this bill into a law. They may by formal resolution declare the question of assent or dissent to be undeced and postponed and yet in opposition to their express declaration to the contrary their assent is to be implied. Cases innumerable might be cited to manifest the irrationality of such an inference. Let one or two in addition suffice. The popular branch of the legislature may express its dissent by an unanimous vote and its resolution may be defeated by a tie vote of the senate and yet the assent is to be implied. Both branches of the legislature may concur in a resolution of deced dissent and yet the governor may exert the veto power conferred on him by the State constitution and their legislative action be defeated and yet the assent of the legislative authority is implied and the directors of this cond institution are authorized to establish a branch or branches in such State whenever they may find it conducive to the interest of the stockholders to do so; and having once established it they can under no circumstances withdraw it except by act of Congress. The State may afterwards protest against such unjust inference but its authority is gone. Its assent is implied by its failure or inability to act at its first session and its voice can never afterwards be heard. To inferences so violent and as they seem to me irrational I can not yield my consent. No court of justice would or could sanction them without reversing all that is established in judicial proceeding by introducing presumptions at variance with fact and inferences at the expense of reason. A State in a condition of duress would be presumed to speak as an inual manacled and in prison might be presumed to be in the enjoyment of freedom. Far better to say to the States boldly and frankly Congress wills and submission is demanded.< It may be sa that the directors may not establish branches under such circumstances; but this is a question of power and this bill invests them with full authority to do so. If the legislature of New York or Pennsylvania or any other State should be found to be in such condition as I have supposed could there be any security furnished against such a step on the part of the directors? Nay is it not fairly to be presumed that this proviso was introduced for the sole purpose of meeting the contingency referred to? Why else should it have been introduced? And I submit to the Senate whether it can be believed that any State would be likely to sit quietly down under such a state of things. In a great measure of public interest their patriotism may be successfully appealed to but to infer their assent from circumstances at war with such inference I can not but regard as calculated to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with the peace and harmony of the country. I must therefore regard this clause as asserting the power to be in Congress to establish offices of discount in a State not only without its assent but against its dissent and so regarding it I can not sanction it. On general principles the right in Congress to prescribe terms to any State implies a superiority of power and control deprives the transaction of all pretense to compact between them and terminates as we have seen in the total abrogation of freedom of action on the part of the States. But further the State may express after the most solemn form of legislation its dissent which may from time to time thereafter be repeated in full  of its own interest which can never be separated from the wise and beneficent operation of this Government and yet Congress may by virtue of the last proviso overrule its law and upon grounds which to such State will appear to rest on a constructive necessity and propriety and nothing more. I regard the bill as asserting for Congress the right to incorporate a United States bank with power and right to establish offices of discount and deposit in the several States of this Union with or without their consenta principle to which I have always heretofore been opposed and which can never obtain my sanction; and waiving all other conserations growing out of its other provisions I return it to the House in which it originated with these my objections to its approval.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:< I communicate herewith to Congress copies of a correspondence which has recently taken place between certain agents of the Government of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands and the Secretary of State.< The condition of those islands has excited a good deal of interest which is increasing by every successive proof that their inhabitants are making progress in civilization and becoming more and more competent to maintain regular and orderly civil government. They lie in the Pacific Ocean much nearer to this continent than the other and have become an important place for the refitment and provisioning of American and European vessels.< Owing to their locality and to the course of the winds which prevail in this quarter of the world the Sandwich Islands are the stopping place for almost all vessels passing from continent to continent across the Pacific Ocean. They are especially resorted to by the great number of vessels of the United States which are engaged in the whale fishery in those seas. The number of vessels of all sorts and the amount of property owned by citizens of the United States which are found in those islands in the course of the year are stated probably with sufficient accuracy in the letter of the agents.< Just emerging from a state of barbarism the Government of the islands is as yet feeble but its dispositions appear to be just and pacific and it seems anxious to improve the condition of its people by the introduction of knowledge of religious and moral institutions means of education and the arts of civilized life.< It can not but be in conformity with the interest and wishes of the Government and the people of the United States that this community thus existing in the mst of a vast expanse of ocean should be respected and all its rights strictly and conscientiously regarded; and this must also be the true interest of all other commercial states. Far remote from the dominions of European powers its growth and prosperity as an independent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade is extended to those regions; while its near approach to this continent and the intercourse which American vessels have with it such vessels constituting fivesixths of all which annually visit it could not but create dissatisfaction on the part of the United States at any attempt by another power should such attempt be threatened or feared to take possession of the islands colonize them and subvert the native Government. Consering therefore that the United States possesses so large a share of the intercourse with those islands it is deemed not unfit to make the declaration that their Government seeks nevertheless no peculiar advantages no exclusive control over the Hawaiian Government but is content with its independent existence and anxiously wishes for its security and prosperity. Its forbearance in this respect under the circumstances of the very large intercourse of their citizens with the islands would justify this Government should events hereafter arise to require it in making a deced remonstrance against the adoption of an opposite policy by any other power. Under the circumstances I recommend to Congress to prove for a moderate allowance to be made out of the Treasury to the consul resing there that in a Government so new and a country so remote American citizens may have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of injury to their persons and property and to whom the Government of the country may also make known any acts committed by American citizens of which it may think it has a right to complain.< Events of conserable importance have recently transpired in China. The military operations carried on against that Empire by the English Government have been terminated by a treaty according to the terms of which four important ports hitherto shut against foreign commerce are to be open to British merchants viz Amoy FooChooFoo Ningpo and Chinghai. It can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of the United States whose intercourse with China at the single port of Canton has already become so conserable to ascertain whether these other ports now open to British commerce are to remain shut nevertheless against the commerce of the United States. The treaty between the Chinese Government and the British commissioner proves neither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ships of other nations. It would seem therefore that it remains with every other nation having commercial intercourse with China to seek to make proper arrangements for itself with the Government of that Empire in this respect.< The importations into the United States from China are known to be large having amounted in some years as will be seen by the annexed tables to $9000000. The exports too from the United States to China constitute an interesting and growing part of the commerce of the country. It appears that in the year 1841 in the direct trade between the two countries the value of the exports from the United States amounted to $715000 in domestic produce and $485000 in foreign merchandise. But the whole amount of American produce which finally reaches China and is there consumed is not comprised in these tables which show only the direct trade. Many vessels with American products on board sail with a primary destination to other countries but ultimately dispose of more or less of their cargoes in the port of Canton.< The peculiarities of the Chinese Government and the Chinese character are well known. An Empire supposed to contain 300000000 subjects fertile in various rich products of the earth not without the knowledge of letters and of many arts and with large and expensive accommodations for internal intercourse and traffic has for ages sought to exclude the visits of strangers and foreigners from its dominions and has assumed for itself a superiority over all other nations. Events appear likely to break down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring China ere long into the relations which usually subsist between civilized states. She has agreed in the treaty with England that correspondence between the agents of the two Governments shall be on equal termsa concession which it is hardly probable will hereafter be withheld from other nations.< It is true that the cheapness of labor among the Chinese their ingenuity in its application and the fixed character of their habits and pursuits may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and sudden demand for the fabrics of other countries. But experience proves that the productions of western nations find a market to some extent among the Chinese; that that market so far as respects the productions of the United States although it has conserably varied in successive seasons has on the whole more than doubled within the last ten years; and it can hardly be doubted that the opening of several new and important ports connected with parts of the Empire heretofore seldom visited by Europeans or Americans would exercise a favorable influence upon the demand for such productions.< It is not understood that the immediate establishment of correspondent embassies and missions or the permanent resence of diplomatic aries with full powers of each country at the Court of the other is cond between England and China although as has been already observed it has been stipulated that intercourse between the two countries shall hereafter be on equal terms. An ambassador or envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredited according to the usages of western nations to the head or sovereign of the state and it may be doubtful whether the Court of Pekin is yet prepared to conform to these usages so far as to receive a minister plenipotentiary to rese near it.< Being of opinion however that the commercial interests of the United States connected with China require at the present moment a degree of attention and vigilance such as there is no agent of this Government on the spot to bestow I recommend to Congress to make appropriation for the compensation of a commissioner to rese in China to exercise a watchful care over the concerns of American citizens and for the protection of their persons and property empowered to hold intercourse with the local authorities and ready under instructions from his Government should such instructions become necessary and proper hereafter to address himself to the high aries of the Empire or through them to the Emperor himself.< It will not escape the observation of Congress that in order to secure the important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence and weight of character should be employed on such agency and that to secure the services of such an inual a compensation should be made corresponding with the magnitude and importance of the mission.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:< I transmit herewith for the information of Congress copies of certain dispatches recently received from Mr. Wise our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the Court of Brazil upon the subject of the slave trade developing the means used and the devices resorted to hi order to evade existing enactments upon that subject.< Anxiously desirous as are the United States to suppress a traffic so revolting to humanity in the efforts to accomplish which they have been the pioneers of civilized states it can not but be a subject of the most profound regret that any portion of our citizens should be found acting in cooperation with the subjects of other powers in opposition to the policy of their own Government thereby subjecting to suspicion and to the hazard of disgrace the flag of their own country. It is true that this traffic is carried on altogether in foreign parts and that our own coasts are free from its pollution; but the crime remains the same wherever perpetrated and there are many circumstances to warrant the belief that some of our citizens are deeply involved in its guilt. The mode and manner of carrying on this trade are clearly and fearlessly set forth in the accompanying documents and it would seem that a regular system has been adopted for the purpose of thwarting the policy and evading the penalties of our laws. American vessels with the knowledge as there are good reasons to believe of the owners and masters are chartered  or rather purchased by notorious slave dealers in Brazil aed by English brokers and capitalists with this intent. The vessel is only nominally chartered at so much per month while in truth it is actually sold to be delivered on the coast of Africa; the charter party binding the owners in the meantime to take on board as passengers a new crew in Brazil who when delivered on the coast are to igate her back to the ports of Brazil with her cargo of slaves. Under this agreement the vessel clears from the United States for some port in Great Britain where a cargo of merchandise known as coast goods and designed especially for the African trade is purchased shipped and consigned together with the vessel either directly to the slave dealer himself or to his agents or accomplices in Brazil. On her arrival a new crew is put on board as passengers and the vessel and cargo consigned to an equally guilty factor or agent on the coast of Africa where the unlawful purpose originally designed is finally consummated. The merchandise is exchanged for slaves the vessel is delivered up her name obliterated her papers destroyed her American crew discharged to be proved for by the charters and the new or passenger crew put in command to carry back its miserable freight to the first contrivers of the voyage or their employees in Brazil.< During the whole progress of this tortuous enterprise it is possible that neither the American crew originally enlisted nor the passenger crew put on board in the Brazilian ports are aware of the nature of the voyage and yet it is on these principally ignorant if not innocent that the penalties of the law are inflicted while the guilty contriversthe charterers brokers owners and masters; in short all who are most deeply concerned in the crime and its rewardsfor the most part escape unpunished.< It will be seen from the examinations which have recently taken place at Rio that the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty as well as our own citizens are deeply implicated in this inhuman traffic. British factors and agents while they supply Africa with British fabrics in exchange for slaves are chiefly instrumental in the abuse of the American flag; and the suggestions contained in the letter of Mr. Wise (whose judicious and zealous efforts in the matter can not be too highly commended) addressed to Mr. Hamilton the British envoy as to the best mode of suppressing the evil deserve your most deliberate conseration as they will receive I doubt not that of the British Government.< It is also worthy of conseration whether any other measures than those now existing are necessary to give greater efficacy to the just and humane policy of our laws which already prove for the restoration to Africa of slaves captured at sea by American cruisers. From time to time provision has been made by this Government for their comfortable support and maintenance during a limited period after their restoration and it is much to be regretted that this liberal policy has not been adopted by Great Britain. As it is it seems to me that the policy it has adopted is calculated rather to perpetuate than to suppress the trade by enlisting very large interests in its favor. Merchants and capitalists furnish the means of carrying it on; manufactures for which the Negroes are exchanged are the products of her workshops; the slaves when captured instead of being returned back to their homes are transferred to her colonial possessions in the West Indies and made the means of swelling the amount of their products by a system of apprenticeship for a term of years; and the officers and crews who capture the vessels receive on the whole number of slaves so many pounds sterling per capita by way of bounty.< It must be obvious that while these large interests are enlisted in favor of its continuance it will be difficult if not impossible to suppress the nefarious traffic and that its results would be in effect but a continuance of the slave trade in another and more cruel form; for it can be but a matter of little difference to the African whether he is torn from his country and transported to the West Indies as a slave in the regular course of the trade or captured .by a cruiser transferred to the same place and made to perform the same labor under the name of an apprentice which is at present the practical operation of the policy adopted.< It is to be hoped that Her Britannic Majesty's Government will upon a re of all the circumstances stated in these dispatches adopt more efficient measures for the suppression of the trade which she has so long attempted to put down with as yet so little success and more consonant with the original policy of restoring the captured African to his home.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:< Notwithstanding the urgency with which I have on more than one occasion felt it my duty to press upon Congress the necessity of proving the Government with the means of discharging its debts and maintaining inviolate the public faith the increasing embarrassments of the Treasury impose upon me the indispensable obligation of again inviting your most serious attention to the condition of the finances. Fortunately for myself in thus bringing this important subject to your  for a deliberate and comprehensive examination in all its bearings and I trust I may add for a final adjustment of it to the common advantage of the whole Union I am permitted to approach it with perfect freedom and candor. As few of the burdens for which provision is now required to be made have been brought upon the country during my short administration of its affairs I have neither motive nor wish to make them a matter of crimination against any of my predecessors. I am disposed to regard as I am bound to treat them as facts which can not now be undone and as deeply interesting to us all and equally imposing upon all the most solemn duties; and the only use I would make of the errors of the past is by a careful examination of their causes and character to avo if possible the repetition of them in future. The condition of the country indeed is such as may well arrest the conflict of parties. The conviction seems at length to have made its way to the minds of all that the disproportion between the public responsibilities and the means proved for meeting them is no casual nor transient evil. It is on the contrary one which for some years to come notwithstanding a resort to all reasonable retrenchments and the constant progress of the country in population and productive power must continue to increase under existing laws unless we consent to give up or impair all our defenses in war and peace. But this is a thought which I am persuaded no patriotic mind would for a moment entertain. Without affecting an alarm which I do not feel in regard to our foreign relations it may safely be affirmed that they are in a state too critical and involve too many momentous issues to permit us to neglect in the least much less to abandon entirely those means of asserting our rights without which negotiation is without dignity and peace without security.< In the report of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to Congress at the commencement of the present session it is estimated that after exhausting all the probable resources of the year there will remain a deficit of about $14000000. With a  partly to a permanent system of revenue and partly to immediate relief from actual embarrassment that officer recommended together with a plan for establishing a Government exchequer some expedients of a more temporary character viz the issuing of Treasury notes and the extension of the time for which the loan authorized to be negotiated by the act of the last session should be taken. Congress accordingly proved for an issue of Treasury notes to the amount of $5000000 but subject to the condition that they should not be pa away below par.< No measure connected with the last of the two objects above mentioned was introduced until recently into the House of Representatives. Should the loan bill now pending before that body pass into a law for its present amount there would still remain a deficit of $2500000. It requires no argument to show that such a condition of the Treasury is incompatible not only with a high state of public credit but with anything approaching to efficiency in the conduct of public affairs. It must be obvious even to the most inexperienced minds that to say nothing of any particular exigency actual or imminent there should be at all times in the Treasury of a great nation with a  to contingencies of ordinary occurrence a surplus at least equal in amount to the above deficiency. But that deficiency serious as it would be in itself will I am compelled to say rather be increased than diminished without the adoption of measures adequate to correct the evil at once. The stagnation of trade and business in some degree incent to the derangement of the national finances and the state of the revenue laws holds out but little prospect of relief in the ordinary course of things for some time to come.< Under such circumstances I am deeply impressed with the necessity of meeting the crisis with a vigor and decision which it imperatively demands at the hands of all intrusted with the conduct of public affairs The gravity of the evil calls for a remedy proportioned to it. No slight palliatives or occasional expedients will give the country the relief it needs. Such measures on the contrary will in the end as is now manifest to all too surely multiply its embarrassments. Relying as I am bound to do on the representatives of a people rendered illustrious among nations by having pa off its whole public debt I shall not shrink from the responsibility imposed upon me by the Constitution of pointing out such measures as will in my opinion insure adequate relief. I am the more encouraged to recommend the course which necessity exacts by the confence which I have in its complete success. The resources of the country in everything that constitutes the wealth and strength of nations are so abundant the spirit of a most industrious enterprising and intelligent people is so energetic and elastic that the Government will be without the shadow of excuse for its delinquency if the difficulties which now embarrass it be not speedily and effectually removed.< From present indications it is hardly doubtful that Congress will find it necessary to lay additional duties on imports in order to meet the ordinary current expenses of the Government. In the exercise of a sound discrimination having reference to revenue but at the same time necessarily affording incental protection to manufacturing industry it seems equally probable that duties on some articles of importation will have to be advanced above 20 per cent. In performing this important work of revising the tariff of duties which in the present emergency would seem to be indispensable I can not too strongly recommend the cultivation of a spirit of mutual harmony and concession to which the Government itself owes its origin and without the continued exercise of which jarring and discord would universally prevail.< An additional reason for the increase of duties in some instances beyond the rate of 20 per cent will exist in fulfilling the recommendations already made and now repeated of making adequate appropriations for the defenses of the country.< By the express provision of the act distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands among the States its operation is ipso facto to cease so soon as the rate of the duties shall exceed the limits prescribed in the act.< In recommending the adoption of measures for distributing the proceeds of the public lands among the States at the commencement of the last session of Congress such distribution was urged by arguments and conserations which appeared to me then and appear to me now of great weight and was placed on the condition that it should not render necessary any departure from the act of 1833. It is with sincere regret that I now perceive the necessity of departing from that act because I am well aware that expectations justly entertained by some of the States will be disappointed by any occasion which shall withhold from them the proceeds of the lands. But the condition was plainly expressed in the message and was inserted in terms equally plain in the law itself and amst the embarrassments which surround the country on all ses and beset both the General and the State Governments it appears to me that the object first and highest in importance is to establish the credit of this Government and to place it on durable foundations and thus afford the most effectual support to the credit of the States equal at least to what it would receive from a direct distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands.< When the distribution law was passed there was reason to anticipate that there soon would be a real surplus to distribute. On that assumption it was in my opinion a wise a just and a beneficent measure. But to continue it in force while there is no such surplus to distribute and when it is manifestly necessary not only to increase the duties but at the same time to borrow money in order to liquate the public debt and disembarrass the public Treasury would cause it to be regarded as an unwise alienation of the best security of the public creditor which would with difficulty be excused and could not be justified.< Causes of no ordinary character have recently depressed American credit in the stock market of the world to a degree quite unprecedented. I need scarcely mention the condition of the banking institutions of some of the States the vast amount of foreign debt contracted during a period of wild speculation by corporations and inuals and above all the doctrine of repudiation of contracts solemnly entered into by States which although as yet applied only under circumstances of a peculiar character and generally rebuked with severity by the moral sense of the community is yet so very licentious and in a Government depending wholly on opinion so very alarming that the impression made by it to our disadvantage as a people is anything but surprising. Under such circumstances it is imperatively due from us to the people whom we represent that when we go into the money market to contract a loan we should tender such securities as to cause the money lender as well at home as abroad to feel that the most propitious opportunity is afforded him of investing profitably and judiciously his capital. A government which has pa off the debts of two wars waged with the most powerful nation of modern times should not be brought to the necessity of chaffering for terms in the money market. Under such circumstances as I have adverted to our object should be to produce with the capitalist a feeling of entire confence by a tender of that sort of security which in all times past has been esteemed sufficient and which for the small amount of our proposed indebtedness will unhesitatingly be regarded as amply adequate. While a pledge of all the revenues amounts to no more than is implied in every instance when the Government contracts a debt and although it ought in ordinary circumstances to be entirely satisfactory yet in times like these the capitalist would feel better satisfied with the pledge of a specific fund ample in magnitude to the payment of his interest and ultimate reimbursement of his principal. Such is the character of the land fund. The most vigilant money dealer will readily perceive that not only will his interest be secure on such a pledge but that a debt of $18000000 or $20000000 would by the surplus of sales over and above the payment of the interest be extinguished within any reasonable time fixed for its redemption. To relieve the Treasury from its embarrassments and to a in meeting its requisitions until time is allowed for any new tariff of duties to become available it would seem to be necessary to fund a debt approaching to $15000000; and in order to place the negotiation of the loan beyond a reasonable doubt I submit to Congress whether the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should not be pledged for the payment of the interest and the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized out of the surplus of the proceeds of such sales to purchase the stock when it can be procured on such terms as will render it beneficial in that way to extinguish the debt and prevent the accumulation of such surplus while its distribution is suspended.< No one can doubt that were the Federal Treasury now as prosperous as it was ten years ago and its fiscal operations conducted by an efficient agency of its own coextensive with the Union the embarrassments of the States and corporations in them would produce even if they continued as they are (were that possible) effects far less disastrous than those now experienced. It is the disorder here at the heart and center of the system that paralyzes and deranges every part of it. Who does not know the permanent importance not to the Federal Government alone but to every State and every inual within its jurisdiction even in their most independent and isolated inual pursuits of the preservation of a sound state of public opinion and a judicious administration here? The sympathy is instantaneous and universal. To attempt to remedy the evil of the deranged credit and currency of the States while the disease is allowed to rage in the vitals of this Government would be a hopeless undertaking.< It is the full conviction of this truth which emboldens me most earnestly to recommend to your early and serious conseration the measures now submitted to your better judgment as well as those to which your attention has been already invited. The first great want of the country that without answering which all attempts at bettering the present condition of things will prove fruitless is a complete restoration of the credit and finances of the Federal Government. The source and foundation of all credit is in the confence which the Government inspires and just in proportion as that confence shall be shaken or diminished will be the distrust among all es of the community and the derangement and demoralization in every branch of business and all the interests of the country. Keep up the standard of good faith and punctuality in the operations of the General Government and all partial irregularities and disorders will be rectified by the influence of its example; but suffer that standard to be debased or disturbed and it is impossible to foresee to what a degree of degradation and confusion all financial interests public and private may sink. In such a country as this the representatives of the people have only to will it and the public credit will be as high as it ever was.< My own s of the measures calculated to effect this great and desirable object I have thus frankly expressed to Congress under circumstances which give to the entire subject a peculiar and solemn interest. The Executive can do no more. If the credit of the country be exposed to question if the public defenses be broken down or weakened if the whole administration of public affairs be embarrassed for want of the necessary means for conducting them with vigor and effect I trust that this department of the Government will be found to have done all that was in its power to avert such evils and will be acquitted of all just blame on account of them.< 
To the House of Representatives of the United States:< I return to the House of Representatives in which it originated the bill entitled An act making appropriations for the improvement of certain harbors and rivers with the following objections to its becoming a law:< At the adoption of the Constitution each State was possessed of a separate and independent sovereignty and an exclusive jurisdiction over all streams and water courses within its territorial limits. The Articles of Confederation in no way affected this authority or jurisdiction and the present Constitution adopted for the purpose of correcting the defects which existed in the original Articles expressly reserves to the States all powers not delegated. No such surrender of jurisdiction is made by the States to this Government by any express grant and if it is possessed it is to be deduced from the clause in the Constitution which invests Congress with authority to make all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into execution the granted powers. There is in my  of the subject no pretense whatever for the claim to power which the bill now returned substantially sets up. The inferential power in order to be legitimate must be clearly and plainly incental to some granted power and necessary to its exercise. To refer it to the head of convenience or usefulness would be to throw open the door to a boundless and unlimited discretion and to invest Congress with an unrestrained authority. The power to remove obstructions from the water courses of the States is claimed under the granted power to regulate commerce with foreign nations among the several States  and with the Indian tribes; but the plain and obvious meaning of this grant is that Congress may adopt rules and regulations prescribing the terms and conditions on which the citizens of the United States may carry on commercial operations with foreign states or kingdoms and on which the citizens or subjects of foreign states or kingdoms may prosecute trade with the United States or either of them. And so the power to regulate commerce among the several States no more invests Congress with jurisdiction over the water courses of the States than the first branch of the grant does over the water courses of foreign powers which would be an absurdity.< The right of common use of the people of the United States to the igable waters of each and every State arises from the express stipulation contained in the Constitution that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States. While therefore the igation of any river in any State is by the laws of such State allowed to the citizens thereof the same is also secured by the Constitution of the United States on the same terms and conditions to the citizens of every other State; and so of any other privilege or immunity.< The application of the revenue of this Government if the power to do so was admitted to improving the igation of the rivers by removing obstructions or otherwise would be for the most part productive only of local benefit. The consequences might prove disastrously ruinous to as many of our fellowcitizens as the exercise of such power would benefit. I will take one instance furnished by the present billout of no invious feeling for such it would be impossible for me to feel but because of my greater familiarity with locationsin illustration of the above opinion: Twenty thousand dollars are proposed to be appropriated toward improving the harbor of Richmond in the State of Virginia. Such improvement would furnish advantages to the city of Richmond and add to the value of the property of its citizens while it might have a most disastrous influence over the wealth and prosperity of Petersburg which is situated some 25 miles distant on a branch of James River and which now enjoys its fair portion of the trade. So too the improvement of James River to Richmond and of the Appomattox to Petersburg might by inviting the trade to those two towns have the effect of prostrating the town of Norfolk. This too might be accomplished without adding a single vessel to the number now engaged in the trade of the Chesapeake Bay or bringing into the Treasury a dollar of additional revenue. It would produce most probably the single effect of concentrating the commerce now profitably enjoyed by three places upon one of them. This case furnishes an apt illustration of the effect of this bill in several other particulars.< There can not in fact be drawn the slightest discrimination between the improving the streams of a State under the power to regulate commerce and the most extended system of internal improvements on land. The excavating a canal and paving a road are equally as much incents to such claim of power as the removing obstructions from water courses; nor can such power be restricted by any fair course of reasoning to the mere fact of making the improvement. It reasonably extends also to the right of seeking a return of the means expended through the exaction of tolls and the levying of contributions. Thus while the Constitution denies to this Government the privilege of acquiring a property in the soil of any State even for the purpose of erecting a necessary fortification without a grant from such State this claim to power would invest it with control and dominion over the waters and soil of each State without restriction. Power so incongruous can not exist in the same instrument.< The bill is also liable to a serious objection because of its blending appropriations for numerous objects but few of which agree in their general features. This necessarily produces the effect of embarrassing Executive action. Some of the appropriations would receive my sanction if separated from the rest however much I might deplore the reproduction of a system which for some time past has been permitted to sleep with apparently the acquiescence of the country. I might particularize the Delaware Breakwater as an improvement which looks to the security from the storms of our extended Atlantic seaboard of the vessels of all the country engaged either in the foreign or the coastwise trade as well as to the safety of the revenue; but when in connection with that the same bill embraces improvements of rivers at points far in the interior connected alone with the trade of such river and the exertion of mere local influences no alternative is left me but to use the qualified veto with which the Executive is invested by the Constitution and to return the bill to the House in which it originated for its ultimate reconseration and decision.< In sanctioning a bill of the same title with that returned for the improvement of the Mississippi and its chief tributaries and certain harbors on the Lakes if I bring myself apparently in conflict with any of the principles herein asserted it will arise on my part exclusively from the want of a just appreciation of localities. The Mississippi occupies a footing altogether different from the rivers and water courses of the different States. No one State or any number of States can exercise any other jurisdiction over it than for the punishment of crimes and the service of civil process. It belongs to no particular State or States but of common right by express reservation to all the States. It is reserved as a great common highway for the commerce of the whole country. To have conceded to Louisiana or to any other State admitted as a new State into the Union the exclusive jurisdiction and consequently the right to make improvements and to levy tolls on the segments of the river embraced within its territorial limits would have been to have disappointed the chief object in the purchase of Louisiana which was to secure the free use of the Mississippi to all the people of the United States. Whether levies on commerce were made by a foreign or domestic government would have been equally burdensome and objectionable. The United States therefore is charged with its improvement for the benefit of all and the appropriation of governmental means to its improvement becomes indispensably necessary for the good of all.< As to the harbors on the Lakes the act originates no new improvements but makes appropriations for the continuance of works already begun.< It is as much the duty of the Government to construct good harbors without reference to the location or interests of cities for the shelter of the extensive commerce of the Lakes as to build breakwaters on the Atlantic coast for the protection of the trade of that ocean. These great inland seas are visited by destructive storms and the annual loss of ships and cargoes and consequently of revenue to the Government is immense. If then there be any work embraced by that act which is not required in order to afford shelter and security to the shipping against the tempests which so often sweep over those great inland seas but has on the contrary originated more in a spirit of speculation and local interest than in one of the character alluded to the House of Representatives will regard my approval of the bill more as the result of misinformation than any design to abandon or modify the principles la down in this message. Every system is liable to run into abuse and none more so than that under conseration; and measures can not be too soon taken by Congress to guard against this evil.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.< FELLOWCITIZENS: You have been assembled in your respective halls of legislation under a proclamation bearing the signature of the illustrious citizen who was so lately called by the direct suffrages of the people to the discharge of the important s of their chief executive office. Upon the expiration of a single month from the day of his installation he has pa the great debt of nature leaving behind him a name associated with the recollection of numerous benefits conferred upon the country during a long life of patriotic devotion. With this public bereavement are connected other conserations which will not escape the attention of Congress. The preparations necessary for his removal to the seat of Government in  of a resence of four years must have devolved upon the late Present heavy expenditures which if permitted to burthen the limited resources of his private fortune may tend seriously to the embarrassment of his surviving family; and it is therefore respectfully submitted to Congress whether the ordinary principles of justice would not dictate the propriety of its legislative interposition. By the provisions of the fundamental law the powers and duties of the high station to which he was elected have devolved upon me and in the dispositions of the representatives of the States and of the people will be found to a great extent a solution of the problem to which our institutions are for the first time subjected.< In entering upon the duties of this office I d not feel that it would be becoming in me to disturb what had been ordered by my lamented predecessor. Whatever therefore may have been my opinion originally as to the propriety of convening Congress at so early a day from that of its late adjournment I found a new and controlling inducement not to interfere with the patriotic desires of the late Present in the novelty of the situation in which I was so unexpectedly placed. My first wish under such circumstances would necessarily have been to have called to my a in the administration of public affairs the combined wisdom of the two Houses of Congress in order to take their counsel and advice as to the best mode of extricating the Government and the country from the embarrassments weighing heavily on both. I am then most happy in finding myself so soon after my accession to the Presency surrounded by the immediate representatives of the States and people.< No important changes having taken place in our foreign relations since the last session of Congress it is not deemed necessary on this occasion to go into a detailed statement in regard to them. I am happy to say that I see nothing to destroy the hope of being able to preserve peace.< The ratification of the treaty with Portugal has been duly exchanged between the two Governments. This Government has not been inattentive to the interests of those of our citizens who have claims on the Government of Spain rounded on express treaty stipulations and a hope is indulged that the representations which have been made to that Government on this subject may lead ere long to beneficial results.< A correspondence has taken place between the Secretary of State and the minister of Her Britannic Majesty accredited to this Government on the subject of Alexander McLeod's indictment and imprisonment copies of which are herewith communicated to Congress.< In addition to what appears from these papers it may be proper to state that Alexander McLeod has been heard by the supreme court of the State of New York on his motion to be discharged from imprisonment and that the decision of that court has not as yet been pronounced.< The Secretary of State has addressed to me a paper upon two subjects interesting to the commerce of the country which will receive my conseration and which I have the honor to communicate to Congress.< So far as it depends on the course of this Government our relations of good will and friendship will be sedulously cultivated with all nations. The true American policy will be found to consist in the exercise of a spirit of justice to be manifested in the discharge of all our international obligations to the weakest of the family of nations as well as to the most powerful. Occasional conflicts of opinion may arise but when the discussions incent to them are conducted in the language of truth and with a strict regard to justice the scourge of war will for the most part be avoed. The time ought to be regarded as having gone by when a resort to arms is to be esteemed as the only proper arbiter of national differences.< The census recently taken shows a regularly progressive increase in our population. Upon the breaking out of the War of the Revolution our numbers scarcely equaled 3000000 souls; they already exceed 17000000 and will continue to progress in a ratio which duplicates in a period of about twentythree years. The old States contain a territory sufficient in itself to maintain a population of additional millions and the most populous of the new States may even yet be regarded as but partially settled while of the new lands on this se of the Rocky Mountains to say nothing of the immense region which stretches from the base of those mountains to the mouth of the Columbia River about 770000000 acres ceded and unceded still remain to be brought into market. We hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to come and settle among us as members of our raply growing family and for the blessings which we offer them we require of them to look upon our country as their country and to unite with us in the great task of preserving our institutions and thereby perpetuating our liberties. No motive exists for foreign conquest; we desire but to reclaim our almost illimitable wildernesses and to introduce into their depths the lights of civilization. While we shall at all times be prepared to vindicate the national honor our most earnest desire will be to maintain an unbroken peace.< In presenting the foregoing s I can not withhold the expression of the opinion that there exists nothing in the extension of our Empire over our acknowledged possessions to excite the alarm of the patriot for the safety of our institutions. The federative system leaving to each State the care of its domestic concerns and devolving on the Federal Government those of general import admits in safety of the greatest expansion; but at the same time I deem it proper to add that there will be found to exist at all times an imperious necessity for restraining all the aries of this Government within the range of their respective powers thereby preserving a just balance between the powers granted to this Government and those reserved to the States and to the people.< From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will perceive that the fiscal means present and accruing are insufficient to supply the wants of the Government for the current year. The balance in the Treasury on the 4th day of March last not covered by outstanding drafts and exclusive of trust funds is estimated at $860000. This includes the sum of $215000 deposited in the Mint and its branches to procure metal for coining and in process of coinage and which could not be withdrawn without inconvenience thus leaving subject to draft in the various depositories the sum of $645000. By virtue of two several acts of Congress the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to issue on and after the 4th day of March last Treasury notes to the amount of $5413000 making an aggregate available fund of $6058000 on hand.< But this fund was chargeable with outstanding Treasury notes redeemable in the current year and interest thereon to the estimated amount of $5280000. There is also thrown upon the Treasury the payment of a large amount of demands accrued in whole or in part in former years which will exhaust the available means of the Treasury and leave the accruing revenue reduced as it is in amount burthened with debt and charged with the current expenses of the Government.< The aggregate amount of outstanding appropriations on the 4th day of March last was $33429616.50 of which $24210000 will be required during the current year; and there will also be required for the use of the War Department additional appropriations to the amount of $2511132.98 the special objects of which will be seen by reference to the report of the Secretary of War. The anticipated means of the Treasury are greatly inadequate to this demand. The receipts from customs for the last three quarters of the last year and first quarter of the present year amounted to $12100000; the receipts for lands for the same time to $2742450 shewing an average revenue from both sources of $1236870 per month.< A gradual expansion of trade growing out of a restoration of confence together with a reduction in the expenses of collecting and punctuality on the part of collecting officers may cause an addition to the monthly receipts from the customs. They are estimated for the resue of the year from the 4th of March at $12000000. The receipts from the public lands for the same time are estimated at $2500000 and from miscellaneous sources at $12000000 making an aggregate of available fund within the year of $15315000 which will leave a probable deficit of $11406132.98. To meet this some temporary provision is necessary until the amount can be absorbed by the excess of revenues which are anticipated to accrue at no distant day.< There will fall due within the next three months Treasury notes of the issues of 1840 including interest about $2850000 There is chargeable in the same period for arrearages for taking the Sixth Census $294000 and the estimated expenditures for the current service are about $8100000 making the aggregate demand upon the Treasury prior to the 1st of September next about $11340000.< The ways and means in the Treasury and estimated to accrue within the abovenamed period consist of about $694000 of funds available on the 28th ultimo an unissued balance of Treasury notes authorized by the act of 1841 amounting to $1955000 and estimated receipts from all sources of $3800000 making an aggregate of about $6450000 and leaving a probable deficit on the 1st of September next of $4845000.< In order to supply the wants of the Government an intelligent constituency in  of their best interests will without hesitation submit to all necessary burthens. But it is nevertheless important so to impose them as to avo defeating the just expectations of the country growing out of preexisting laws. The act of the 2d of March 1833 commonly called the compromise act should not be altered except under urgent necessities which are not believed at this time to exist. One year only remains to complete the series of reductions proved for by that law at which time provisions made by the same law and which then will be brought actively in a of the manufacturing interests of the Union will not fail to produce the most beneficial results. Under a system of discriminating duties imposed for purposes of revenue in unison with the provisions of existing laws it is to be hoped that our policy will in the future be fixed and permanent so as to avo those constant fluctuations which defeat the very objects they have in . We shall thus best maintain a position which while it will enable us the more readily to meet the advances of other countries calculated to promote our trade and commerce will at the same time leave in our own hands the means of retaliating with greater effect unjust regulations.< In intimate connection with the question of revenue is that which makes provision for a suitable fiscal agent capable of adding increased facilities in the collection and disbursement of the public revenues rendering more secure their custody and consulting a true economy in the great multiplied and delicate operations of the Treasury Department. Upon such an agent depends in an eminent degree the establishment of a currency of uniform value which is of so great importance to all the essential interests of society and on the wisdom to be manifested in its creation much depends. So intimately interwoven are its operations not only with the interests of inuals but of States that it may be regarded to a great degree as controlling both. If paper be used as the chief medium of circulation and the power be vested in the Government of issuing it at pleasure either in the form of Treasury drafts or any other or if banks be used as the public depositories with liberty to regard all surpluses from day to day as so much added to their active capital prices are exposed to constant fluctuations and industry to severe suffering. In the one case political conserations directed to party purposes may control while excessive cupity may prevail in the other. The public is thus constantly liable to imposition. Expansions and contractions may follow each other in rap successionthe one engendering a reckless spirit of adventure and speculation which embraces States as well as inuals the other causing a fall in prices and accomplishing an entire change in the aspect of affairs. Stocks of all sorts raply decline inuals are ruined and States embarrassed even in their efforts to meet with punctuality the interest on their debts. Such unhappily is the condition of things now existing in the United States. These effects may readily be traced to the causes above referred to. The public revenues being removed from the then Bank of the United States under an order of a late Present were placed in selected State banks which actuated by the double motive of conciliating the Government and augmenting their profits to the greatest possible extent enlarged extravagantly their discounts thus enabling all other existing banks to do the same; large ends were declared which stimulating the cupity of capitalists caused a rush to be made to the legislatures of the respective States for similar acts of incorporation which by many of the States under a temporary infatuation were readily granted and thus the augmentation of the circulating medium consisting almost exclusively of paper produced a most fatal delusion. An illustration derived from the land sales of the period alluded to will serve best to show the effect of the whole system. The average sales of the public lands for a period of ten years prior to 1834 had not much exceeded $2000000 per annum. In 1834 they attained in round numbers to the amount of $6000000; in the succeeding year of 1835 they reached $16000000 and the next year of 1836 they amounted to the enormous sum of $25000000 thus crowding into the short space of three years upward of twentythree years' purchase of the public domain. So apparent had become the necessity of arresting this course of things that the executive department assumed the highly questionable power of discriminating in the funds to be used in payment by different es of public debtorsa discrimination which was doubtless designed to correct this most ruinous state of things by the exaction of specie in all payments for the public lands but which could not at once arrest the te which had so strongly set in. Hence the demands for specie became unceasing and corresponding prostration raply ensued under the necessities created with the banks to curtail their discounts and thereby to reduce their circulation. I recur to these things with no disposition to censure preexisting Administrations of the Government but simply in exemplification of the truth of the position which I have assumed. If then any fiscal agent which may be created shall be placed without due restrictions either in the hands of the administrators of the Government or those of private inuals the temptation to abuse will prove to be resistless. Objects of political aggrandizement may seduce the first and the promptings of a boundless cupity will assail the last. Aed by the experience of the past it will be the pleasure of Congress so to guard and fortify the public interests in the creation of any new agent as to place them so far as human wisdom can accomplish it on a footing of perfect security. Within a few years past three different schemes have been before the country. The charter of the Bank of the United States expired by its own limitations in 1836. An effort was made to renew it which received the sanction of the two Houses of Congress but the then Present of the United States exercised his veto power and the measure was defeated. A regard to truth requires me to say that the Present was fully sustained in the course he had taken by the popular voice. His successor to the chair of state unqualifiedly pronounced his opposition to any new charter of a similar institution and not only the popular election which brought him into power but the elections through much of his term seemed clearly to indicate a concurrence with him in sentiment on the part of the people. After the public moneys were withdrawn from the United States Bank they were placed in deposit with the State banks and the result of that policy has been before the country. To say nothing as to the question whether that experiment was made under propitious or adverse circumstances it may safely be asserted that it d receive the unqualified condemnation of most of its early advocates and it is believed was also condemned by the popular sentiment. The existing subtreasury system does not seem to stand in higher favor with the people but has recently been condemned in a manner too plainly indicated to admit of a doubt. Thus in the short period of eight years the popular voice may be regarded as having successively condemned each of the three schemes of finance to which I have adverted. As to the first it was introduced at a time (1816) when the State banks then comparatively few in number had been forced to suspend specie payments by reason of the war which had previously prevailed with Great Britain. Whether if the United States Bank charter which expired in 1811 had been renewed in due season it would have been enabled to continue specie payments during the war and the disastrous period to the commerce of the country which immediately succeeded is to say the least problematical and whether the United States Bank of 1816 produced a restoration of specie payments or the same was accomplished through the instrumentality of other means was a matter of some difficulty at that time to determine. Certain it is that for the first years of the operation of that bank its course was as disastrous as for the greater part of its subsequent career it became eminently successful. As to the second the experiment was tried with a redundant Treasury which continued to increase until it seemed to be the part of wisdom to distribute the surplus revenue among the States which operating at the same time with the specie circular and the causes before adverted to caused them to suspend specie payments and involved the country in the greatest embarrassment. And as to the third if carried through all the stages of its transmutation from paper and specie to nothing but the precious metals to say nothing of the insecurity of the public moneys its injurious effects have been anticipated by the country in its unqualified condemnation. What is now to be regarded as the judgment of the American people on this whole subject I have no accurate means of determining but by appealing to their more immediate representatives. The late contest which terminated in the election of General Harrison to the Presency was deced on principles well known and openly declared and while the subtreasury received in the result the most deced condemnation yet no other scheme of finance seemed to have been concurred in. To you then who have come more directly from the body of our common constituents I submit the entire question as best qualified to give a full exposition of their wishes and opinions. I shall be ready to concur with you in the adoption of such system as you may propose reserving to myself the ultimate power of rejecting any measure which may in my  of it conflict with the Constitution or otherwise jeopardize the prosperity of the countrya power which I could not part with even if I would but which I will not believe any act of yours will call into requisition.< I can not avo recurring in connection with this subject to the necessity which exists for adopting some suitable measure whereby the unlimited creation of banks by the States may be corrected in future. Such result can be most readily achieved by the consent of the States to be expressed in the form of a compact among themselves which they can only enter into with the consent and approbation of this Governmenta consent which might in the present emergency of the public demands justifiably be given by Congress in advance of any action by the States as an inducement to such action upon terms well defined by the act of tender. Such a measure addressing itself to the calm reflection of the States would find in the experience of the past and the condition of the present much to sustain it; and it is greatly to be doubted whether any scheme of finance can prove for any length of time successful while the States shall continue in the unrestrained exercise of the power of creating banking corporations. This power can only be limited by their consent.< With the adoption of a financial agency of a satisfactory character the hope may be indulged that the country may once more return to a state of prosperity. Measures auxiliary thereto and in some measure inseparably connected with its success will doubtless claim the attention of Congress. Among such a distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands proved such distribution does not force upon Congress the necessity of imposing upon commerce heavier burthens than those cond by the act of 1833 would act as an efficient remedial measure by being brought directly in a of the States. As one sincerely devoted to the task of preserving a just balance in our system of Government by the maintenance of the States in a condition the most free and respectable and in the full possession of all their power I can no otherwise than feel desirous for their emancipation from the situation to which the pressure on their finances now subjects them. And while I must repudiate as a measure founded in error and wanting constitutional sanction the slightest approach to an assumption by this Government of the debts of the States yet I can see in the distribution adverted too much to recommend it. The compacts between the proprietor States and this Government expressly guarantee to the States all the benefits which may arise from the sales. The mode by which this is to be effected addresses itself to the discretion of Congress as the trustee for the States and its exercise after the most beneficial manner is restrained by nothing in the grants or in the Constitution so long as Congress shall consult that equality in the distribution which the compacts require. In the present condition of some of the States the question of distribution may be regarded as substantially a question between direct and indirect taxation. If the distribution be not made in some form or other the necessity will daily become more urgent with the debtor States for a resort to an oppressive system of direct taxation or their credit and necessarily their power and influence will be greatly diminished. The payment of taxes after the most inconvenient and oppressive mode will be exacted in place of contributions for the most part voluntarily made and therefore comparatively unoppressive. The States are emphatically the constituents of this Government and we should be entirely regardless of the objects held in  by them in the creation of this Government if we could be indifferent to their good. The happy effects of such a measure upon all the States would immediately be manifested. With the debtor States it would effect the relief to a great extent of the citizens from a heavy burthen of direct taxation which presses with severity on the laboring es and eminently assist in restoring the general prosperity. An immediate advance would take place in the price of the State securities and the attitude of the States would become once more as it should ever be lofty and erect. With States laboring under no extreme pressure from debt the fund which they would derive from this source would enable them to improve their condition in an eminent degree. So far as this Government is concerned appropriations to domestic objects approaching in amount the revenue derived from the land sales might be abandoned and thus a system of unequal and therefore unjust legislation would be substituted by one dispensing equality to all the members of this Confederacy. Whether such distribution should be made directly to the States in the proceeds of the sales or in the form of profits by virtue of the operations of any fiscal agency having those proceeds as its basis should such measure be cond by Congress would well deserve its conseration. Nor would such disposition of the proceeds of the sales in any manner prevent Congress from time to time from passing all necessary preemption laws for the benefit of actual settlers or from making any new arrangement as to the price of the public lands which might in future be esteemed desirable.< I beg leave particularly to call your attention to the accompanying report from the Secretary of War. Beses the present state of the war which has so long afflicted the Territory of Flora and the various other matters of interest therein referred to you will learn from it that the Secretary has instituted an inquiry into abuses which promises to develop gross enormities in connection with Indian treaties which have been negotiated as well as in the expenditures for the removal and subsistence of the Indians. represents also other irregularities of a serious nature that have grown up in the practice of the Indian Department which will require the appropriation of upward of $200000 to correct and which claim the immediate attention of Congress.< In reflecting on the proper means of defending the country we can not shut our eyes to the consequences which the introduction and use of the power of steam upon the ocean are likely to produce in wars between maritime states. We can not yet see the extent to which this power may be applied in belligerent operations connecting itself as it does with recent improvements in the science of gunnery and projectiles; but we need have no fear of being left in regard to these things behind the most active and skillful of other nations if the genius and enterprise of our fellowcitizens receive proper encouragement and direction from Government.< True wisdom would nevertheless seem to dictate the necessity of placing in perfect condition those fortifications which are designed for the protection of our principal cities and roadsteads. For the defense of our extended maritime coast our chief reliance should be placed on our Navy aed by those inventions which are destined to recommend themselves to public adoption but no time should be lost in placing our principal cities on the seaboard and the Lakes in a state of entire security from foreign assault. Separated as we are from the countries of the Old World and in much unaffected by their policy we are happily relieved from the necessity of maintaining large standing armies in times of peace. The policy which was adopted by Mr. Monroe shortly after the conclusion of the late war with Great Britain of preserving a regularly organized staff sufficient for the command of a large military force should a necessity for one arise is rounded as well in economy as in true wisdom. Provision is thus made upon filling up the rank and file which can readily be done on any emergency for the introduction of a system of discipline both promptly and efficiently. All that is required in time of peace is to maintain a sufficient number of men to guard our fortifications to meet any sudden contingency and to encounter the first shock of war. Our chief reliance must be placed on the militia; they constitute the great body of national guards and inspired by an ardent love of country will be found ready at all times and at all seasons to repair with alacrity to its defense. It will be regarded by Congress I doubt not at a suitable time as one of its highest duties to attend to their complete organization and discipline.< The state of the y pension fund requires the immediate attention of Congress. By the operation of the act of the 3d of March 1837 entitled An act for the more equitable administration of the y pension fund that fund has been exhausted. It will be seen from the accompanying report of the Commissioner of Pensions that there will be required for the payment of y pensions on the 1st of July next $88706.06 1/3 and on the 1st of January 1842 the sum of $69000. In addition to these sums about $6000 will be required to pay arrears of pensions which will probably be allowed between the 1st of July and the 1st of January 1842 making in the whole $163706.06 1/3. To meet these payments there is within the control of the Department the sum of $28040 leaving a deficiency of $139666.06 1/3. The public faith requires that immediate provision should be made for the payment of these sums.< In order to introduce into the Navy a desirable efficiency a new system of accountability may be found to be indispensably necessary. To mature a plan having for its object the accomplishment of an end so important and to meet the just expectations of the country require more time than has yet been allowed to the Secretary at the head of the Department. The hope is indulged that by the time of your next regular session measures of importance in connection with this branch of the public service may be matured for your conseration.< Although the laws regulating the PostOffice Department only require from the officer charged with its direction to report at the usual annual session of Congress the PostmasterGeneral has presented to me some facts connected with the financial condition of the Department which are deemed worthy the attention of Congress. By the accompanying report of that officer it appears the existing liabilities of that Department beyond the means of payment at its command can not be less than $500000. As the laws organizing that branch of the public service confine the expenditure to its own revenues deficiencies therein can not be presented under the usual estimates for the expenses of Government. It must therefore be left to Congress to determine whether the moneys now due the contractors shall be pa from the public Treasury or whether that Department shall continue under its present embarrassments. It will be seen by the report of the PostmasterGeneral that the recent lettings of contracts in several of the States have been made at such reduced rates of compensation as to encourage the belief that if the Department was relieved from existing difficulties its future operations might be conducted without any further call upon the general Treasury.< The power of appointing to office is one of a character the most delicate and responsible. The appointing power is evermore exposed to be led into error. With anxious solicitude to select the most trustworthy for official station I can not be supposed to possess a personal knowledge of the qualifications of every applicant. I deem it therefore proper in this most public manner to invite on the part of the Senate a just scrutiny into the character and pretensions of every person I may bring to their notice in the regular form of a nomination for office. Unless persons every way trustworthy are employed in the public service corruption and irregularity will inevitably follow. I shall with the greatest cheerfulness acquiesce in the decision of that body and regarding it as wisely constituted to a the executive department in the performance of this delicate duty I shall look to its consent and advice as given only in furtherance of the best interests of the country. I shall also at the earliest proper occasion invite the attention of Congress to such measures as in my judgment will be best calculated to regulate and control the Executive power in reference to this vitally important subject.< I shall also at the proper season invite your attention to the statutory enactments for the suppression of the slave trade which may require to be rendered more efficient in their provisions. There is reason to believe that the traffic is on the increase. Whether such increas
 is to be ascribed to the abolition of slave labor in the British possessions in our vicinity and an attendant diminution in the supply of those articles which enter into the general consumption of the world thereby augmenting the demand from other quarters and thus calling for additional labor it were needless to inquire. The highest conserations of public honor as well as the strongest promptings of humanity require a resort to the most vigorous efforts to suppress the trade.< In conclusion I beg to invite your particular attention to the interests of this District; nor do I doubt but that in a liberal spirit of legislation you will seek to advance its commercial as well as its local interests. Should Congress deem it to be its duty to repeal the existing subtreasury law the necessity of proving a suitable place of deposit of the public moneys which may be required within the District must be apparent to all.< I have felt it due to the country to present the foregoing topics to your conseration and reflection. Others with which it might not seem proper to trouble you at an extraordinary session will be la before you at a future day. I am happy in committing the important affairs of the country into your hands. The tendency of public sentiment I am pleased to believe is toward the adoption in a spirit of union and harmony of such measures as will fortify the public interests. To cherish such a tendency of public opinion is the task of an elevated patriotism. That differences of opinion as to the means of accomplishing these desirable objects should exist is reasonably to be expected. Nor can all be made satisfied with any system of measures; but I flatter myself with the hope that the great body of the people will readily unite in support of those whose efforts spring from a disinterested desire to promote their happiness to preserve the Federal and State Governments within their respective orbits; to cultivate peace with all the nations of the earth on just and honorable grounds; to exact obedience to the laws; to intrench liberty and property in full security; and consulting the most rig economy to abolish all useless expenses.< 
To the House of Representatives:< In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 23d of March last requesting the Present to lay before the House the authority and the true copies of all requests and applications upon which he deemed it his duty to interfere with the al and military forces of the United States on the occasion of the recent attempt of the people of Rhode Island to establish a free constitution in the place of the old charter government of that State; also copies of the instructions to and statements of the charter commissioners sent to him by the then existing authorities of the State of Rhode Island; also copies of the correspondence between the Executive of the United States and the charter government of the State of Rhode Island and all the papers and documents connected with the same; also copies of the correspondence if any between the heads of Departments and sa charter government or any person or persons connected with the sa government and of any accompanying papers and documents; also copies of all orders issued by the Executive of the United States or any of the Departments to military officers for the movement or employment of troops to or in Rhode Island; also copies of all orders to al officers to prepare steam or other vessels of the United States for service in the waters of Rhode Island; also copies of all orders to the officers of revenue cutters for the same service; also copies of any instructions borne by the Secretary of War to Rhode Island on his visit in 1842 to re the troops of the charter government; also copies of any order or orders to any officer or officers of the Army or Navy to report themselves to the charter government; and that he be requested to lay before this House copies of any other papers or documents in the possession of the Executive connected with this subject not above specifically enumerated I have to inform the House that the Executive d not deem it his duty to interfere with the al and military forces of the United States in the late disturbances in Rhode Island; that no orders were issued by the Executive or any of the Departments to military officers for the movement or employment of troops to or in Rhode Island other than those which accompany this message and which cond the strengthening of the garrison at Fort Adams which consering the extent of the agitation in Rhode Island was esteemed necessary and judicious; that no orders were issued to al officers to prepare steam or other vessels of the United States for service in the waters of Rhode Island; that no orders were issued to the officers of the revenue cutters for sa service; that no instructions were borne by the Secretary of War to Rhode Island on his visit in 1842 to re the troops of the charter government ; that no orders were given to any officer or officers of the Army or Navy to report themselves to the charter government; that requests and applications were made to the Executive to fulfill the guaranties of the Constitution which impose on the Federal Government the obligation to protect and defend each State of the Union against domestic violence and foreign invasion but the Executive was at no time convinced that the casus faederis had arisen which required the interposition of the military or al power in the controversy which unhappily existed between the people of Rhode Island. I was in no manner prevented from so interfering by the inquiry whether Rhode Island existed as an independent State of the Union under a charter granted at an early period by the Crown of Great Britain or not. It was enough for the Executive to know that she was recognized as a sovereign State by Great Britain by the treaty of 1783; that at a later day she had in common with her sister States poured out her blood and freely expended her treasure in the War of the Revolution; that she was a party to the Articles of Confederation; that at an after period she adopted the Constitution of the United States as a free independent and republican State; and that in this character she has always possessed her full quota of representation in the Senate and House of Representatives; and that up to a recent day she has conducted all her domestic affairs and fulfilled all her obligations as a member of the Union in peace and war under her charter government  as it is denominated by the resolution of the House of the 23d March. I must be permitted to disclaim entirely and unqualifiedly the right on the part of the Executive to make any real or supposed defects existing in any State constitution or form of government the pretext for a failure to enforce the laws or the guaranties of the Constitution of the United States in reference to any such State. I utterly repudiate the ea in terms as emphatic as I can employ that those laws are not to be enforced or those guaranties complied with because the Present may believe that the right of suffrage or any other great popular right is either too restricted or too broadly enlarged. I also with equal strength resist the ea that it fails within the Executive competency to dece in controversies of the nature of that which existed in Rhode Island on which se is the majority of the people or as to the extent of the rights of a mere numerical majority. For the Executive to assume such a power would be to assume a power of the most dangerous character. Under such assumptions the States of this Union would have no security for peace or tranquillity but might be converted into the mere instruments of Executive will. Actuated by selfish purposes he might become the great agitator fomenting assaults upon the State constitutions and declaring the majority of today to be the minority of tomorrow and the minority in its turn the majority before whose decrees the established order of things in the State should be subverted. Revolution civil commotion and bloodshed would be the inevitable consequences. The provision in the Constitution intended for the security of the States would thus be turned into the instrument of their destruction. The Present would become in fact the great constitution maker for the States and all power would be vested in his hands.< When therefore the governor of Rhode Island by his letter of the 4th of April 1842 made a requisition upon the Executive for a to put down the late disturbances I had no hesitation in recognizing the obligations of the Executive to furnish such a upon the occurrence of the contingency proved for by the Constitution and laws. My letter of the 11th of April in reply to the governor's letter of the 4th is herewith communicated together with all correspondence which passed at a subsequent day and the letters and documents mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed. From the correspondence between the Executive of the United States and that of Rhode Island it will not escape observation that while I regarded it as my duty to announce the principles by which I should govern myself in the contingency of an armed interposition on the part of this Government being necessary to uphold the rights of the State of Rhode Island and to preserve its domestic peace yet that the strong hope was indulged and expressed that all the difficulties would disappear before an enlightened policy of conciliation and compromise. In that spirit I addressed to Governor King the letter of the 9th of May 1842 marked private and confential and received his reply of the 12th of May of the same year. The desire of the Executive was from the beginning to bring the dispute to a termination without the interposition of the military power of the United States and it will continue to be a subject of selfcongratulation that this leading object of policy was finally accomplished. The Executive resisted all entreaties however urgent to depart from this line of conduct. Information from private sources had led the Executive to conclude that little else was designed by Mr. Dorr and his adherents than mere menace with a  to intimation; nor was this opinion in any degree shaken until the 22d of June 1842 when it was strongly represented from reliable sources as will be seen by reference to the documents herewith communicated that preparations were making by Mr. Dorr with a large force in arms to invade the State which force had been recruited in the neighboring States and had been already preceded by the collection of military stores in conserable quantities at one or two points. This was a state of things to which the Executive could not be indifferent. Mr. Dorr speedily afterwards took up his headquarters at Chepachet and assumed the command of what was reported to be a large force drawn chiefly from voluntary enlistments made in neighboring States. The Executive could with difficulty bring itself to realize the fact that the citizens of other States should have forgotten their duty to themselves and the Constitution of the United States and have entered into the highly reprehensible and indefensible course of interfering so far in the concerns of a sister State as to have entered into plans of invasion conquest and revolution; but the Executive felt it to be its duty to look minutely into the matter and therefore the Secretary of War was dispatched to Rhode Island with instructions (a copy of which is herewith transmitted) and was authorized should a requisition be made upon the Executive by the government of Rhode Island in pursuance of law and the invaders should not abandon their purposes to call upon the governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut for a sufficient number of militia at once to arrest the invasion and to interpose such of the regular troops as could be spared from Fort Adams for the defense of the city of Provence in the event of its being attacked as was strongly represented to be in contemplation. Happily there was no necessity for either issuing the proclamation or the requisition or for removing the troops from Fort Adams where they had been properly stationed. Chepachet was evacuated and Mr. Dorr's troops dispersed without the necessity of the interposition of any military force by this Government thus confirming me in my early impressions that nothing more had been designed from the first by those associated with Mr. Dorr than to excite fear and apprehension and thereby to obtain concessions from the constituted authorities which might be claimed as a triumph over the existing government.< With the dispersion of Mr. Dorr's troops ended all difficulties. A convention was shortly afterwards called by due course of law to amend the fundamental law and a new constitution based on more liberal principles than that abrogated was proposed and adopted by the people. Thus the great American experiment of a change in government under the influence of opinion and not of force has been again crowned with success and the State and people of Rhode Island repose in safety under institutions of their own adoption unterrified by any future prospect of necessary change and secure against domestic violence and invasion from abroad. I congratulate the country upon so happy a termination of a condition of things which seemed at one time seriously to threaten the public peace. It may justly be regarded as worthy of the age and of the country in which we live.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: < In coming together fellowcitizens to enter again upon the discharge of the duties with which the people have charged us severally we find great occasion to rejoice in the general prosperity of the country. We are in the enjoyment of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty with unexampled means of education knowledge and improvement. Through the year which is now drawing to a close peace has been in our borders and plenty in our habitations and although disease has visited some few portions of the land with distress and mortality yet in general the health of the people has been preserved and we are all called upon by the highest obligations of duty to renew our thanks and our devotion to our Heavenly Parent who has continued to vouchsafe to us the eminent blessings which surround us and who has so signally crowned the year with His goodness. If we find ourselves increasing beyond example in numbers in strength in wealth in knowledge in everything which promotes human and social happiness let us ever remember our dependence for all these on the protection and merciful dispensations of Divine Provence. < Since your last adjournment Alexander McLeod a British subject who was indicted for the murder of an American citizen and whose case has been the subject of a correspondence heretofore communicated to you has been acquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury and has under the judgment of the court been regularly discharged. < Great Britain having made known to this Government that the expedition which was fitted out from Canada for the destruction of the steamboat Caroline in the winter of 1837 and which resulted in the destruction of sa boat and in the death of an American citizen was undertaken by orders emanating from the authorities of the British Government in Canada and demanding the discharge of McLeod upon the ground that if engaged in that expedition he d but fulfill the orders of his Government has thus been answered in the only way in which she could be answered by a government the powers of which are distributed among its several departments by the fundamental law. Happily for the people of Great Britain as well as those of the United States the only mode by which an inual arraigned for a criminal offense before the courts of either can obtain his discharge is by the independent action of the judiciary and by proceedings equally familiar to the courts of both countries. < If in Great Britain a power exists in the Crown to cause to be entered a nolle prosequi which is not the case with the Executive power of the United States upon a prosecution pending in a State court yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge. The precise stage of the proceedings at which such order may be made is a matter of municipal regulation exclusively and not to be complained of by any other government. In cases of this kind a government becomes politically responsible only when its tribunals of last resort are shown to have rendered unjust and injurious judgments in matters not doubtful. To the establishment and elucation of this principle no nation has lent its authority more efficiently than Great Britain. Alexander McLeod having his option either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme court of New York which had been rendered upon his application for a discharge to the Supreme Court of the United States or to submit his case to the decision of a jury preferred the latter deeming it the readiest mode of obtaining his liberation; and the result has fully sustained the wisdom of his choice. The manner in which the issue submitted was tried will satisfy the English Government that the principles of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened decision of an American tribunal. I can not fail however to suggest to Congress the propriety and in some degree the necessity of making such provisions by law so far as they may constitutionally do so for the removal at their commencement and at the option of the party of all such cases as may hereafter arise and which may involve the faithful observance and execution of our international obligations from the State to the Federal judiciary. This Government by our institutions is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth and ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other. While just confence is felt in the judiciary of the States yet this Government ought to be competent in itself for the fulfillment of the high duties which have been devolved upon it under the organic law by the States themselves.  In the month of September a party of armed men from Upper Canada invaded< the territory of the United States and forcibly seized upon the person< of one Grogan and under circumstances of great harshness hurriedly carried< him beyond the limits of the United States and delivered him np to the< authorities of Upper Canada. His immediate discharge was ordered by those< authorities upon the facts of the case being brought to their knowledgea< course of procedure which was to have been expected from a nation with< whom we are at peace and which was not more due to the rights of the United< States than to its own regard for justice. The correspondence which passed< between the Department of State and the British envoy Mr. Fox and with< the governor of Vermont as soon as the facts had been made known to this< department are herewith communicated. < I regret that it is not in my power to make known to you an equally satisfactory conclusion in the case of the Caroline steamer with the circumstances connected with the destruction of which in December 1837 by an armed force fitted out in the Province of Upper Canada you are already made acquainted. No such atonement as was due for the public wrong done to the United States by this invasion of her territory so wholly irreconcilable with her rights as an independent power has yet been made. In the  taken by this Government the inquiry whether the vessel was in the employment of those who were prosecuting an unauthorized war against that Province or was engaged by the owner in the business of transporting passengers to and from Navy Island in hopes of private gain which was most probably the case in no degree alters the real question at issue between the two Governments. This Government can never concede to any foreign government the power except in a case of the most urgent and extreme necessity of invading its territory either to arrest the persons or destroy the property of those who may have violated the municipal laws of such foreign government or have disregarded their obligations arising under the law of nations. The territory of the United States must be regarded as sacredly secure against all such invasions until they shall voluntarily acknowledge their inability to acquit themselves of their duties to others. And in announcing this sentiment I do but affirm a principle which no nation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazards than the people and Government of Great Britain. If upon a full investigation of all the facts it shall appear that the owner of the Caroline was governed by a hostile intent or had made common cause with those who were in the occupancy of Navy Island then so far as he is concerned there can be no claim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this Government would feel itself bound to prosecute since he would have acted not only in derogation of the rights of Great Britain but in clear violation of the laws of the United States; but that is a question which however settled in no manner involves the higher conseration of the violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction. To recognize it as an admissible practice that each Government in its turn upon any sudden and unauthorized outbreak which on a frontier the extent of which renders it impossible for either to have an efficient force on every mile of it and which outbreak therefore neither may be able to suppress in a day may take vengeance into its own hands and without even a remonstrance and in the absence of any pressing or overruling necessity may invade the territory of the other would inevitably lead to results equally to be deplored by both. When border collisions come to receive the sanction or to be made on the authority of either Government general war must be the inevitable result. While it is the ardent desire of the United States to cultivate the relations of peace with all nations and to fulfill all the duties of good neighborhood toward those who possess territories adjoining their own that very desire would lead them to deny the right of any foreign power to invade their boundary with an armed force. The correspondence between the two Governments on this subject will at a future day of your session be submitted to your conseration; and in the meantime I can not but indulge the hope that the British Government will see the propriety of renouncing as a rule of future action the precedent which has been set in the affair at Schlosser. < I herewith submit the correspondence which has recently taken place between the American minister at the Court of St. James Mr. Stevenson and the minister of foreign affairs of that Government on the right claimed by that Government to visit and detain vessels sailing under the American flag and engaged in prosecuting lawful commerce in the African seas. Our commercial interests in that region have experienced conserable increase and have become an object of much importance and it is the duty of this Government to protect them against all improper and vexatious interruption. However desirous the United States may be for the suppression of the slave trade they can not consent to interpolations into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of other governments. We deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nations of the earth without our consent. We claim to have a voice in all amendments or alterations of that code and when we are given to understand as in this instance by a foreign government that its treaties with other nations can not be executed without the establishment and enforcement of new principles of maritime police to be applied without our consent we must employ a language neither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction. American citizens prosecuting a lawful commerce in the African seas under the flag of their country are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that flag by others; nor can they rightfully on account of any such alleged abuses be interrupted molested or detained while on the ocean and if thus molested and detained while pursuing honest voyages in the usual way and violating no law themselves they are unquestionably entitled to indemnity. This Government has manifested its repugnance to the slave trade in a manner which can not be misunderstood. By its fundamental law it prescribed limits in point of time to its continuance and against its own citizens who might so far forget the rights of humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic it has long since by its municipal laws denounced the most condign punishment. Many of the States composing this Union had made appeals to the civilized world for its suppression long before the moral sense of other nations had become shocked by the iniquities of the traffic. Whether this Government should now enter into treaties containing mutual stipulations upon this subject is a question for its mature deliberation. Certain it is that if the right to detain American ships on the high seas can be justified on the plea of a necessity for such detention arising out of the existence of treaties between other nations the same plea may be extended and enlarged by the new stipulations of new treaties to which the United States may not be a party. This Government will not cease to urge upon that of Great Britain full and ample remuneration for all losses whether arising from detention or otherwise to which American citizens have heretofore been or may hereafter be subjected by the exercise of rights which this Government can not recognize as legitimate and proper. Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain her to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any American citizen engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have experienced at the hands of her cruisers or other public authorities. This Government at the same time will relax no effort to prevent its citizens if there be any so disposed from prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the feelings of humanity. It seeks to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury; but while the enterprising mariner engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade is entitled to its protection it will visit with condign punishment others of an opposite character. < I invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the African slave trade and recommend all such alterations as may give to them greater force and efficacy. That the American flag is grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations is but too probable. Congress has not long since had this subject under its conseration and its importance well justifies renewed and anxious attention. < I also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between Mr. Stevenson and Lord Palmerston upon the subject so interesting to several of the Southern States of the rice duties which resulted honorably to the justice of Great Britain and advantageously to the United States. < At the opening of the last annual session the Present informed Congress of the progress which had then been made in negotiating a convention between this Government and that of England with a  to the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the territorial limits of the two countries. I regret to say that little further advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year but this is owing to circumstances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion and to settle the question in dispute as early as possible. In the course of the session it is my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable end. < The commission appointed by this Government for the exploration and survey of the line of boundary separating the States of Maine and New Hampshire from the conterminous British Provinces is it is believed about to close its field labors and is expected soon to report the results of its examinations to the Department of State. The report when received will be la before Congress. < The failure on the part of Spain to pay with punctuality the interest due under the convention of 1834 for the settlement of claims between the two countries has made it the duty of the Executive to call the particular attention of that Government to the subject. A disposition has been manifested by it which is believed to be entirely sincere to fulfill its obligations in this respect so soon as its internal condition and the state of its finances will permit. An arrangement is in progress from the result of which it is trusted that those of our citizens who have claims under the convention will at no distant day receive the stipulated payments. < A treaty of commerce and igation with Belgium was concluded and signed at Washington on the 29th of March 1840 and was duly sanctioned by the Senate of the United States. The treaty was ratified by His Belgian Majesty but d not receive the approbation of the Belgian Chambers within the time limited by its terms and has therefore become vo. < This occurrence assumes the graver aspect from the conseration that in 1833 a treaty negotiated between the two Governments and ratified on the part of the United States failed to be ratified on the part of Belgium. The representative of that Government at Washington informs the Department of State that he has been instructed to give explanations of the causes which occasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature and to express the regret of the King at the occurrence. < The joint commission under the convention with Texas to ascertain the true boundary between the two countries has concluded its labors but the final report of the commissioner of the United States has not been received. It is understood however that the merian line as traced by the commission lies somewhat farther east than the position hitherto generally assigned to it and consequently includes in Texas some part of the territory which had been consered as belonging to the States of Louisiana and Arkansas. < The United States can not but take a deep interest in whatever relates to this young but growing Republic. Settled principally by emigrants from the United States we have the happiness to know that the great principles of civil liberty are there destined to flourish under wise institutions and wholesome laws and that through its example another evence is to be afforded of the capacity of popular institutions to advance the prosperity happiness and permanent glory of the human race. The great truth that government was made for the people and not the people for government has already been established in the practice and by the example of these United States and we can do no other than con its further exemplification by a sister republic with the deepest interest. < Our relations with the independent States of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of Spain have not undergone any material change within the past year. The incessant sanguinary conflicts in or between those countries are to be greatly deplored as necessarily tending to disable them from performing their duty as members of the community of nations and rising to the destiny which the position and natural resources of many of them might lead them justly to anticipate as constantly giving occasion also directly or indirectly for complaints on the part of our citizens who resort thither for purposes of commercial intercourse and as retarding reparation for wrongs already committed some of which are by no means of recent date. < The failure of the Congress of Ecuador to hold a session at the time appointed for that purpose in January last will probably render abortive a treaty of commerce with that Republic which was signed at Quito on the 13th of June 1839 and had been duly ratified on our part but which required the approbation of that body prior to its ratification by the Ecuadorian Executive. < A convention which has been concluded with the Republic of Peru proving for the settlement of certain claims of citizens of the United States upon the Government of that Republic will be duly submitted to the Senate. < The claims of our citizens against the Brazilian Government originating from captures and other causes are still unsatisfied. The United States have however so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations of amity with that Empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the same spirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would afford will be given without further avoable delay. < The war with the Indian tribes on the peninsula of Flora has during the last summer and fall been prosecuted with untiring activity and zeal. A summer campaign was resolved upon as the best mode of bringing it to a close. Our brave officers and men who have been engaged in that service have suffered toils and privations and exhibited an energy which in any other war would have won for them unfading laurels. In despite of the sickness incent to the climate they have penetrated the fastnesses of the Indians broken up their encampments and harassed them unceasingly. Numbers have been captured and still greater numbers have surrendered and have been transported to join their brethren on the lands elsewhere allotted to them by the Government and a strong hope is entertained that under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troops in Flora that troublesome and expensive war is destined to a speedy termination. With all the other Indian tribes we are enjoying the blessings of peace. Our duty as well as our best interests prompts us to observe in all our intercourse with them felity in fulfilling our engagements the practice of strict justice as well as the constant exercise of acts of benevolence and kindness. These are the great instruments of civilization and through the use of them alone can the untutored child of the forest be induced to listen to its teachings. < The Secretary of State on whom the acts of Congress have devolved the duty of directing the proceedings for the taking of the sixth census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States will report to the two Houses the progress of that work. The enumeration of persons has been completed and exhibits a grand total of 17069453 making an increase over the census of 1830 of 4202646 inhabitants and showing a gain in a ratio exceeding 32 1/2 per cent for the last ten years. < From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury you will be informed of the condition of the finances. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last as stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to Congress at the extra session was $987345.03. The receipts into the Treasury during the first three quarters of this year from all sources amount to $23467072.52; the estimated receipts for the fourth quarter amount to $6943095.25 amounting to $30410167.77 and making with the balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last $31397512.80. The expenditures for the first three quarters of this year amount to $24734346.97. The expenditures for the fourth quarter as estimated will amount to $7290723.73 thus making a total of $32025070.70 and leaving a deficit to be proved for on the 1st of January next of about $627557.90. < Of the loan of $12000000 which was authorized by Congress at its late session only $5432726.88 have been negotiated. The shortness of time which it had to run has presented no inconserable impediment in the way of its being taken by capitalists at home while the same cause would have operated with much greater force in the foreign market. For that reason the foreign market has not been resorted to; and it is now submitted whether it would not be advisable to amend the law by making what remains undisposed of payable at a more distant day. < Should it be necessary in any  that Congress may take of the subject to revise the existing tariff of duties I beg leave to say that in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate counsels would seem to be the wisest. The Government under which it is our happiness to live owes its existence to the spirit of compromise which prevailed among its framers; jarring and discordant opinions could only have been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism which prompted conciliation and resulted in harmony. In the same spirit the compromise bill as it is commonly called was adopted at the session of 1833. While the people of no portion of the Union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxes for the support of Government yet an innate repugnance exists to the imposition of burthens not really necessary for that object. In imposing duties however for the purposes of revenue a right to discriminate as to the articles on which the duty shall be la as well as the amount necessarily and most properly exists; otherwise the Government would be placed in the condition of having to levy the same duties upon all articles the productive as well as the unproductive. The slightest duty upon some might have the effect of causing their importation to cease whereas others entering extensively into the consumption of the country might bear the heaviest without any sensible diminution in the amount imported. So also the Government may be justified in so discriminating by reference to other conserations of domestic policy connected with our manufactures. So long as the duties shall be la with distinct reference to the wants of the Treasury no wellrounded objection can exist against them. It might be esteemed desirable that no such augmentation of the taxes should take place as would have the effect of annulling the lanroceeds distribution act of the last session which act is declared to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased beyond 20 per cent the maximum rate established by the compromise act. Some of the provisions of the compromise act which will go into effect on the 30th day of June next may however be found exceedingly inconvenient in practice under any regulations that Congress may adopt. I refer more particularly to that relating to the home valuation. A difference in value of the same articles to some extent will necessarily exist at different ports but that is altogether insignificant when compared with the conflicts in valuation which are likely to arise from the differences of opinion among the numerous appraisers of merchandise. In many instances the estimates of value must be conjectural and thus as many different rates of value may be established as there are appraisers. These differences in valuation may also be increased by the inclination which without the slightest imputation on their honesty may arise on the part of the appraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry. I recommend this whole subject to the conseration of Congress with a single additional remark. Certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy are in all respects eminently desirable but more particularly is this true in all that affects trade and commerce the operations of which depend much more on the certainty of their returns and calculations which embrace distant periods of time than on high bounties or duties which are liable to constant fluctuations. < At your late session I invited your attention to the condition of the currency and exchanges and urged the necessity of adopting such measures as were consistent with the constitutional competency of the Government in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and as far as practicable the inequalities of the other. No country can be in the enjoyment of its full measure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange approximating to uniformity of value. What is necessary as between the different nations of the earth is also important as between the inhabitants of different parts of the same country. With the first the precious metals constitute the chief medium of circulation and such also would be the case as to the last but for inventions comparatively modern which have furnished in place of gold and silver a paper circulation. I do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merits of the two systems. Such belonged more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system. The speculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry but his researches could only lead him to conclude that the paper system had probably better never have been introduced and that society might have been much happier without it. The practical statesman has a very different task to perform. has to look at things as they are to take them as he finds them to supply deficiencies and to prune excesses as far as in him lies. The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements of the paper medium with us is almost inexpressibly great. The power exerted by the States to charter banking corporations and which having been carried to a great excess has filled the country with in most of the States an irredeemable paper medium is an evil which in some way or other requires a corrective. The rates at which bills of exchange are negotiated between different parts of the country furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver which is in many parts so far depreciated as not to be received except at a large discount in payment of debts or in the purchase of produce. It could earnestly be desired that every bank not possessing the means of resumption should follow the example of the late United States Bank of Pennsylvania and go into liquation rather than by refusing to do so to continue embarrassments in the way of solvent institutions thereby augmenting the difficulties incent to the present condition of things. Whether this Government with due regard to the rights of the States has any power to constrain the banks either to resume specie payments or to force them into liquation is an inquiry which will not fail to claim your conseration. In  of the great advantages which are allowed the corporators not among the least of which is the authority contained in most of their charters to make loans to three times the amount of their capital thereby often deriving three times as much interest on the same amount of money as any inual is permitted by law to receive no sufficient apology can be urged for a longcontinued suspension of specie payments. Such suspension is productive of the greatest detriment to the public by expelling from circulation the precious metals and seriously hazarding the success of any effort that this Government can make to increase commercial facilities and to advance the public interests. < This is the more to be regretted and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency becomes the more manifest when we reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country. Of this we have no statistics nor just data for forming adequate opinions. But there can be no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea and the transportation inland by railroads and canals and by steamboats and other modes of conveyance over the surface of our vast rivers and immense lakes and the value of property carried and interchanged by these means form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country large as it is makes but a distant approach. < In the absence of any controlling power over this subject which by forcing a general resumption of specie payments would at once have the effect of restoring a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the country but little to desire what measure of relief falling within the limits of our constitutional competency does it become this Government to adopt? It was my painful duty at your last session under the weight of most solemn obligations to differ with Congress on the measures which it proposed for my approval and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of existing evils. Subsequent reflection and events since occurring have only served to confirm me in the opinions then entertained and frankly expressed. I must be permitted to add that no scheme of governmental policy unaed by inual exertions can be available for ameliorating the present condition of things. Commercial modes of exchange and a good currency are but the necessary means of commerce and intercourse not the direct productive sources of wealth. Wealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of industry and the savings of frugality and nothing can be more ill judged than to look to facilities in borrowing or to a redundant circulation for the power of discharging pecuniary obligations. The country is full of resources and the people fall of energy and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassments must be sought in industry economy the observance of good faith and the favorable influence of time. In pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to Congress which pledge I urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details of any plan the Secretary of the Treasury will be ready to submit to you should you require it a plan of finance which while it throws around the public treasure reasonable guards for its protection and rests on powers acknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of the Government will at the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium and afford all reasonable facilities for regulating the exchanges. When submitted you will perceive in it a plan amendatory of the existing laws in relation to the Treasury Department subordinate in all respects to the will of Congress directly and the will of the people indirectly selfsustaining should it be found in practice to real
ze its promises in theory and repealable at the pleasure of Congress. It proposes by effectual restraints and by invoking the true spirit of our institutions to separate the purse from the sword or more properly to speak denies any other control to the Present over the agents who may be selected to carry it into execution but what may be indispensably necessary to secure the felity of such agents and by wise regulations keeps plainly apart from each other private and public funds. It cons the establishment of a board of control at the seat of government with agencies at prominent commercial points or wherever else Congress shall direct for the safekeeping and disbursement of the public moneys and a substitution at the option of the public creditor of Treasury notes in lieu of gold and silver. It proposes to limit the issues to an amount not to exceed $15000000 without the express sanction of the legislative power. It also authorizes the receipt of inual deposits of gold and silver to a limited amount and the granting certificates of deposit ed into such sums as may be called for by the depositors. It proceeds a step further and authorizes the purchase and sale of domestic bills and drafts resting on a real and substantial basis payable at sight or having but a short time to run and drawn on places not less than 100 miles apart which authority except in so far as may be necessary for Government purposes exclusively is only to be exerted upon the express condition that its exercise shall not be prohibited by the State in which the agency is situated. In order to cover the expenses incent to the plan it will be authorized to receive moderate premiums for certificates issued on deposits and on bills bought and sold and thus as far as its dealings extend to furnish facilities to commercial intercourse at the lowest possible rates and to subduct from the earnings of industry the least possible sum. It uses the State banks at a distance from the agencies as auxiliaries without imparting any power to trade in its name. It is subjected to such guards and restraints as have appeared to be necessary. It is the creature of law and exists only at the pleasure of the Legislature. It is made to rest on an actual specie basis in order to redeem the notes at the places of issue produces no dangerous redundancy of circulation affords no temptation to speculation is attended by no inflation of prices is equable in its operation makes the Treasury notes (which it may use along with the certificates of deposit and the notes of speciepaying banks) convertible at the place where collected receivable in payment of Government dues and without violating any principle of the Constitution affords the Government and the people such facilities as are called for by the wants of both. Such it has appeared to me are its recommendations and in  of them it will be submitted whenever you may require it to your conseration. < I am not able to perceive that any fair and cand objection can be urged against the plan the principal outlines of which I have thus presented. I can not doubt but that the notes which it proposes to furnish at the voluntary option of the public creditor issued in lieu of the revenue and its certificates of deposit will be maintained at an equality with gold and silver everywhere. They are redeemable in gold and silver on demand at the places of issue. They are receivable everywhere in payment of Government dues. The Treasury notes are limited to an amount of onefourth less than the estimated annual receipts of the Treasury and in addition they rest upon the faith of the Government for their redemption. If all these assurances are not sufficient to make them available then the ea as it seems to me of furnishing a sound paper medium of exchange may be entirely abandoned.< If a fear be indulged that the Government may be tempted to run into excess in its issues at any future day it seems to me that no such apprehension can reasonably be entertained until all confence in the representatives of the States and of the people as well as of the people themselves shall be lost. The weightiest conserations of policy require that the restraints now proposed to be thrown around the measure should not for light causes be removed. To argue against any proposed plan its liability to possible abuse is to reject every expedient since everything dependent on human action is liable to abuse. Fifteen millions of Treasury notes may be issued as the maximum but a discretionary power is to be given to the board of control under that sum and every conseration will unite in leading them to feel their way with caution. For the first eight years of the existence of the late Bank of the United States its circulation barely exceeded $4000000 and for five of its most prosperous years it was about equal to $16000000; furthermore the authority given to receive private deposits to a limited amount and to issue certificates in such sums as may be called for by the depositors may so far fill up the channels of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any conserable issue of Treasury notes. A restraint upon the amount of private deposits has seemed to be indispensably necessary from an apprehension thought to be well founded that in any emergency of trade confence might be so far shaken in the banks as to induce a withdrawal from them of private deposits with a  to insure their unquestionable safety when deposited with the Government which might prove eminently disastrous to the State banks. Is it objected that it is proposed to authorize the agencies to deal in bills of exchange? It is answered that such dealings are to be carried on at the lowest possible premium are made to rest on an unquestionably sound basis are designed to reimburse merely the expenses which would otherwise devolve upon the Treasury and are in strict subordination to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Bank of Augusta against Earle and other reported cases and thereby avos all conflict with State jurisdiction which I hold to be indispensably requisite. It leaves the banking privileges of the States without interference looks to the Treasury and the Union and while furnishing every facility to the first is careful of the interests of the last. But above all it is created by law is amendable by law and is repealable by law and wedded as I am to no theory but looking solely to the advancement of the public good I shall be among the very first to urge its repeal if it be found not to subserve the purposes and objects for which it may be created. Nor will the plan be submitted in any overweening confence in the sufficiency of my own judgment but with much greater reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of Congress. I can not abandon this subject without urging upon you in the most emphatic manner whatever may be your action on the suggestions which I have felt it to be my duty to submit to relieve the Chief Executive Magistrate by any and all constitutional means from a controlling power over the public Treasury. If in the plan proposed should you deem it worthy of your conseration that separation is not as complete as you may desire you will doubtless amend it in that particular. For myself I disclaim all desire to have any control over the public moneys other than what is indispensably necessary to execute the laws which you may pass. < Nor can I fail to advert in this connection to the debts which many of the States of the Union have contracted abroad and under which they continue to labor. That indebtedness amounts to a sum not less than $200000000 and which has been retributed to them for the most part in works of internal improvement which are destined to prove of vast importance in ultimately advancing their prosperity and wealth. For the debts thus contracted the States are alone responsible. I can do not more than express the belief that each State will feel itself bound by every conseration of honor as well as of interest to meet its engagements with punctuality. The failure however of any one State to do so should in no degree affect the credit of the rest and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other State stocks because any one or more of the States may neglect to prove with punctuality the means of redeeming their engagements. Even such States should there be any consering the great rapity with which their resources are developing themselves will not fail to have the means at no very distant day to redeem their obligations to the uttermost farthing; nor will I doubt but that in  of that honorable conduct which has evermore governed the States and the people of the Union they will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient before they will forego a faithful compliance with their obligations. < From the report of the Secretary of War and other reports accompanying it you will be informed of the progress which has been made in the fortifications designed for the protection of our principal cities roadsteads and inland frontier during the present year together with their true state and condition. They will be prosecuted to completion with all the expedition which the means placed by Congress at the disposal of the Executive will allow. < I recommend particularly to your conseration that portion of the Secretary's report which proposes the establishment of a chain of military posts from Council Bluffs to some point on the Pacific Ocean within our limits. The benefit thereby destined to accrue to our citizens engaged in the fur trade over that wilderness region added to the importance of cultivating friendly relations with savage tribes inhabiting it and at the same time of giving protection to our frontier settlements and of establishing the means of safe intercourse between the American settlements at the mouth of the Columbia River and those on this se of the Rocky Mountains would seem to suggest the importance of carrying into effect the recommendations upon this head with as little delay as may be practicable. < The report of the Secretary of the Navy will place you in possession of the present condition of that important arm of the national defense. Every effort will be made to add to its efficiency and I can not too strongly urge upon you liberal appropriations to that branch of the public service. Inducements of the weightiest character exist for the adoption of this course of policy. Our extended and otherwise exposed maritime frontier calls for protection to the furnishing of which an efficient al force is indispensable. We look to no foreign conquests nor do we propose to enter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean; but it is due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of the United States that no nation should be permitted to invade our waters at pleasure and subject our towns and villages to conflagration or pillage. Economy in all branches of the public service is due from all the public agents to the people but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the necessary means for the protection of our domestic fireses from invasion and our national honor from disgrace. I would most earnestly recommend to Congress to abstain from all appropriations for objects not absolutely necessary; but I take upon myself without a moment of hesitancy all the responsibility of recommending the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant Navy which has lighted up every sea with its victories and spread an imperishable glory over the country. < The report of the PostmasterGeneral will claim your particular attention not only because of the valuable suggestions which it contains but because of the great importance which at all times attaches to that interesting branch of the public service. The increased expense of transporting the mail along the principal routes necessarily claims the public attention and has awakened a corresponding solicitude on the part of the Government. The transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facilities of intercommunication which are every day becoming greater through the building of railroads and the application of steam power but it can not be disguised that in order to do so the PostOffice Department is subjected to heavy exactions. The lines of communication between distant parts of the Union are to a great extent occupied by railroads which in the nature of things possess a complete monopoly and the Department is therefore liable to heavy and unreasonable charges. This evil is destined to great increase in future and some timely measure may become necessary to guard against it. < I feel it my duty to bring under your conseration a practice which has grown up in the administration of the Government and which I am deeply convinced ought to be corrected. I allude to the exercise of the power which usage rather than reason has vested in the Presents of removing incumbents from office in order to substitute others more in favor with the dominant party. My own conduct in this respect has been governed by a conscientious purpose to exercise the removing power only in cases of unfaithfulness or inability or in those in which its exercise appeared necessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active partisanship on the part of holders of office which not only withdraws them from the steady and impartial discharge of their official duties but exerts an undue and injurious influence over elections and degrades the character of the Government itself inasmuch as it exhibits the Chief Magistrate as being a party through his agents in the secret plots or open workings of political parties. < In respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be left to discretion which may safely be regulated by law and it is of high importance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal interests in public elections. Consering the great increase which has been made in public offices in the last quarter of a century and the probability of further increase we incur the hazard of witnessing violent political contests directed too often to the single object of retaining office by those who are in or obtaining it by those who are out. Under the influence of these convictions I shall cordially concur in any constitutional measure for regulating and by regulating restraining the power of removal. < I suggest for your conseration the propriety of making without further delay some specific application of the funds derived under the will of Mr. Smithson of England for the diffusion of knowledge and which have heretofore been vested in public stocks until such time as Congress should think proper to give them a specific direction. Nor will you I feel confent permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to be made should it turn out that the stocks in which the investments have been made have undergone a depreciation. < In conclusion I commend to your care the interests of this District for which you are the exclusive legislators. Consering that this city is the resence of the Government and for a large part of the year of Congress and consering also the great cost of the public buildings and the propriety of affording them at all times careful protection it seems not unreasonable that Congress should contribute toward the expense of an efficient police.
To the Senate and House of Representatives:< I herewith transmit to the two Houses of Congress a letter from his excellency the governor of Texas dated on the 14th day of June last addressed to the late Present of the United States which not having been answered by him came to my hands on his death; and I also transmit a copy of the answer which I have felt it to be my duty to cause to be made to that communication.< Congress will perceive that the governor of Texas officially states that by authority of the legislature of that State he dispatched a special commissioner with full power and instructions to extend the civil jurisdiction of the State over the unorganized counties of El Paso Worth Presio and Santa Fe situated on its northwestern limits.< proceeds to say that the commissioner had reported to him in an official form that the military officers employed in the service of the United States stationed at Santa Fe interposed adversely with the inhabitants to the fulfillment of his object in favor of the establishment of a separate State government east of the Rio Grande and within the rightful limits of the State of Texas. These four counties which Texas thus proposes to establish and organize as being within her own jurisdiction extend over the whole of the territory east of the Rio Grande which has heretofore been regarded as an essential and integral part of the department of New Mexico and actually governed and possessed by her people until conquered and severed from the Republic of Mexico by the American arms.< The legislature of Texas has been called together by her governor for the purpose as is understood of maintaining her claim to the territory east of the Rio Grande and of establishing over it her own jurisdiction and her own laws by force.< These proceedings of Texas may well arrest the attention of all branches of the Government of the United States and I rejoice that they occur while the Congress is yet in session. It is I fear far from being impossible that in consequence of these proceedings of Texas a crisis may be brought on which shall summon the two Houses of Congress and still more emphatically the executive government to an immediate readiness for the performance of their respective duties.< By the Constitution of the United States the Present is constituted Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy and of the militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States. The Constitution declares also that he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed and that he shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union.< Congress has power by the Constitution to prove for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union and suitable and appropriate acts of Congress have been passed as well for proving for calling forth the militia as for placing other suitable and efficient means in the hands of the Present to enable him to discharge the constitutional s of his office.< The second section of the act of the 28th of February 1795 declares that whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or their execution obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or the power vested in the marshals the Present may call forth the militia as far as may be necessary to suppress such combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed.< By the act of March 3 1807 it is proved that in all cases of obstruction to the laws either of the United States or any inual State or Territory where it is lawful for the Present to call forth the militia for the purpose of causing the laws to be duly executed it shall be lawful for him to employ for the same purposes such part of the land or al force of the United States as shall be judged necessary.< These several enactments are now in full force so that if the laws of the United States are opposed or obstructed in any State or Territory by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the judicial or civil authorities it becomes a case in which it is the duty of the Present either to call out the militia or to employ the military and al force of the United States or to do both if in his judgment the exigency of the occasion shall so require for the purpose of suppressing such combinations. The constitutional duty of the Present is plain and peremptory and the authority vested in him by law for its performance clear and ample.< Texas is a State authorized to maintain her own laws so far as they are not repugnant to the Constitution laws and treaties of the United States; to suppress insurrections against her authority and to punish those who may commit treason against the State according to the forms proved by her own constitution and her own laws.< But all this power is local and confined entirely within the limits of Texas herself. She can possibly confer no authority which can be lawfully exercised beyond her own boundaries.< All this is plain and hardly needs argument or elucation. If Texas militia therefore march into any one of the other States or into any Territory of the United States there to execute or enforce any law of Texas they become at that moment trespassers; they are no longer under the protection of any lawful authority and are to be regarded merely as intruders; and if within such State or Territory they obstruct any law of the United States either by power of arms or mere power of numbers constituting such a combination as is too powerful to be suppressed by the civil authority the Present of the United States has no option left to him but is bound to obey the solemn injunction of the Constitution and exercise the high powers vested in him by that instrument and by the acts of Congress.< Or if any civil posse armed or unarmed enter into any Territory of the United States under the protection of the laws thereof with intent to seize inuals to be carried elsewhere for trial for alleged offenses and this posse be too powerful to be resisted by the local civil authorities such seizure or attempt to seize is to be prevented or resisted by the authority of the United States.< The grave and important question now arises whether there be in the Territory of New Mexico any existing law of the United States opposition to which or the obstruction of which would constitute a case calling for the interposition of the authority vested in the Present.< The Constitution of the United States declares that< This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land.< If therefore New Mexico be a Territory of the United States and if any treaty stipulation be in force therein such treaty stipulation is the supreme law of the land and is to be maintained and upheld accordingly.< In the letter to the governor of Texas my reasons are given for believing that New Mexico is now a Territory of the United States with the same extent and the same boundaries which belonged to it while in the actual possession of the Republic of Mexico and before the late war. In the early part of that war both California and New Mexico were conquered by the arms of the United States and were in the military possession of the United States at the date of the treaty of peace.< By that treaty the title by conquest was confirmed and these territories provinces or departments separated from Mexico forever and by the same treaty certain important rights and securities were solemnly guaranteed to the inhabitants resing therein.< By the fifth article of the treaty it is declared that< The boundary line between the two Republics shall commence in the Gulf of Mexico 3 leagues from land opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande otherwise called Rio Bravo del Norte or opposite the mouth of its deepest branch if it should have more than one branch emptying directly into the sea; from thence up the mdle of that river following the deepest channel where it has more than one to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of New Mexico; thence westwardly along the whole southern boundary of New Mexico (which runs north of the town called Paso) to its western termination; thence northward along the western line of New Mexico until it intersects the first branch of the river Gila (or if it should not intersect any branch of that river then to the point on the sa line nearest to such branch and thence in a direct line to the same); thence down the mdle of the sa branch and of the sa river until it empties into the Rio Colorado; thence across the Rio Colorado following the ision line between Upper and Lower California to the Pacific Ocean.< The eighth article of the treaty is in the following terms:< Mexicans now established in territories previously belonging to Mexico and which remain for the future within the limits of the United States as defined by the present treaty shall be free to continue where they now rese or to remove at any time to the Mexican Republic retaining the property which they possess in the sa territories or disposing thereof and removing the proceeds wherever they please without their being subjected on this account to any contribution tax or charge whatever.< Those who shall prefer to remain in the sa territories may either retain the title and rights of Mexican citizens or acquire those of citizens of the United States; but they shall be under the obligation to make their election within one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications of this treaty; and those who shall remain in the sa territories after the expiration of that year without having declared their intention to retain the character of Mexicans shall be consered to have elected to become citizens of the United States.< In the sa territories property of every kind now belonging to Mexicans not established there shall be inviolably respected. The present owners the heirs of these and all Mexicans who may hereafter acquire sa property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it guaranties equally ample as if the same belonged to citizens of the United States.< The ninth article of the treaty is in these words:< The Mexicans who in the territories aforesa shall not preserve the character of citizens of the Mexican Republic conformably with what is stipulated in the preceding article shall be incorporated into the Union of the United States and be admitted at the proper time (to be judged of by the Congress of the United States) to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States according to the principles of the Constitution and in the meantime shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction.< It is plain therefore on the face of these treaty stipulations that all Mexicans established in territories north or east of the line of demarcation already mentioned come within the protection of the ninth article and that the treaty being a part of the supreme law of the land does extend over all such Mexicans and assures to them perfect security in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property as well as in the free exercise of their religion; and this supreme law of the land being thus in actual force over this territory is to be maintained until it shall be displaced or superseded by other legal provisions; and if it be obstructed or resisted by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the civil authority the case is one which comes within the provisions of law and which obliges the Present to enforce those provisions. Neither the Constitution nor the laws nor my duty nor my oath of office leave me any alternative or any choice in my mode of action.< The executive government of the United States has no power or authority to determine what was the true line of boundary between Mexico and the United States before the treaty of Guadalupe Halgo nor has it any such power now since the question has become a question between the State of Texas and the United States. So far as this boundary is doubtful that doubt can only be removed by some act of Congress to which the assent of the State of Texas may be necessary or by some appropriate mode of legal adjudication; but in the meantime if disturbances or collisions arise or should be threatened it is absolutely incumbent on the executive government however painful the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully maintained; and he can regard only the actual state of things as it existed at the date of the treaty and is bound to protect all inhabitants who were then established and who now remain north and east of the line of demarcation in the full enjoyment of their liberty and property according to the provisions of the ninth article of the treaty. In other words all must be now regarded as New Mexico which was possessed and occupied as New Mexico by citizens of Mexico at the date of the treaty until a definite line of boundary shall be established by competent authority.< This assertion of duty to protect the people of New Mexico from threatened violence or from seizure to be carried into Texas for trial for alleged offenses against Texan laws does not at all include any claim of power on the part of the Executive to establish any civil or military government within that Territory. That power belongs exclusively to the legislative department and Congress is the sole judge of the time and manner of creating or authorizing any such government.< The duty of the Executive extends only to the execution of laws and the maintenance of treaties already in force and the protection of all the people of the United States in the enjoyment of the rights which those treaties and laws guarantee.< It is exceedingly desirable that no occasion should arise for the exercise of the powers thus vested in the Present by the Constitution and the laws. With whatever mildness those powers might be executed or however clear the case of necessity yet consequences might nevertheless follow of which no human sagacity can foresee either the evils or the end.< Having thus la before Congress the communication of his excellency the governor of Texas and the answer thereto and having made such observations as I have thought the occasion called for respecting constitutional obligations which may arise in the further progress of things and may devolve on me to be performed I hope I shall not be regarded as stepping ase from the line of my duty notwithstanding that I am aware that the subject is now before both Houses if I express my deep and earnest conviction of the importance of an immediate decision or arrangement or settlement of the question of boundary between Texas and the Territory of New Mexico. All conserations of justice general expediency and domestic tranquillity call for this. It seems to be in its character and by position the first or one of the first of the questions growing out of the acquisition of California and New Mexico and now requiring decision.< No government can be established for New Mexico either State or Territorial until it shall be first ascertained what New Mexico is and what are her limits and boundaries. These can not be fixed or known till the line of ision between her and Texas shall be ascertained and established; and numerous and weighty reasons conspire in my judgment to show that this isional line should be established by Congress with the assent of the government of Texas. In the first place this seems by far the most prompt mode of proceeding by which the end can be accomplished. If judicial proceedings were resorted to such proceedings would necessarily be slow and years would pass by in all probability before the controversy could be ended. So great a delay in this case is to be avoed if possible. Such delay would be every way inconvenient and might be the occasion of disturbances and collisions. For the same reason I would with the utmost deference to the wisdom of Congress express a doubt of the expediency of the appointment of commissioners and of an examination estimate and an award of indemnity to be made by them. This would be but a species of arbitration which might last as long as a suit at law.< So far as I am able to comprehend the case the general facts are now all known and Congress is as capable of decing on it justly and properly now as it probably would be after the report of the commissioners. If the claim of title on the part of Texas appears to Congress to be well rounded in whole or in part it is in the competency of Congress to offer her an indemnity for the surrender of that claim. In a case like this surrounded as it is by many cogent conserations all calling for amicable adjustment and immediate settlement the Government of the United States would be justified in my opinion in allowing an indemnity to Texas not unreasonable or extravagant but fair liberal and awarded in a just spirit of accommodation.< I think no event would be hailed with more gratification by the people of the United States than the amicable adjustment of questions of difficulty which have now for a long time agitated the country and occupied to the exclusion of other subjects the time and attention of Congress.< Having thus freely communicated the results of my own reflections on the most advisable mode of adjusting the boundary question I shall nevertheless cheerfully acquiesce in any other mode which the wisdom of Congress may devise. And in conclusion I repeat my conviction that every conseration of the public interest manifests the necessity of a provision by Congress for the settlement of this boundary question before the present session be brought to a close. The settlement of other questions connected with the same subject within the same period is greatly to be desired but the adjustment of this appears to me to be in the highest degree important. In the train of such an adjustment we may well hope that there will follow a return of harmony and good will an increased attachment to the Union and the general satisfaction of the country.<

FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: Being suddenly called in the mst of the last session of Congress bya painful dispensation of Divine Provence to the responsible stationwhich I now hold I contented myself with such communications to the Legislatureas the exigency of the moment seemed to require. The country was shroudedin mourning for the loss of its venerable Chief Magistrate and all heartswere penetrated with grief. Neither the time nor the occasion appearedto require or to justify on my part any general expression of politicalopinions or any announcement of the principles which would govern me inthe discharge of the duties to the performance of which I had been so unexpectedlycalled. I trust therefore that it may not be deemed inappropriate ifI avail myself of this opportunity of the reassembling of Congress to makeknown my sentiments in a general manner in regard to the policy which oughtto be pursued by the Government both in its intercourse with foreign nationsand its management and administration of internal affairs. Nations like inuals in a state of nature are equal and independentpossessing certain rights and owing certain duties to each other arisingfrom their necessary and uoable relations; which rights and dutiesthere is no common human authority to protect and enforce. Still theyare rights and duties binding in morals in conscience and in honoralthough there is no tribunal to which an injured party can appeal butthe disinterested judgment of mankind and ultimately the arbitrament ofthe sword. Among the acknowledged rights of nations is that which each possessesof establishing that form of government which it may deem most conduciveto the happiness and prosperity of its own citizens of changing that formas circumstances may require and of managing its internal affairs accordingto its own will. The people of the United States claim this right for themselvesand they readily concede it to others. Hence it becomes an imperative dutynot to interfere in the government or internal policy of other nations;and although we may sympathize with the unfortunate or the oppressed everywherein their struggles for freedom our principles forb us from taking anypart in such foreign contests. We make no wars to promote or to preventsuccessions to thrones to maintain any theory of a balance of power orto suppress the actual government which any country chooses to establishfor itself. We instigate no revolutions nor suffer any hostile militaryexpeditions to be fitted out in the United States to invade the territoryor provinces of a friendly nation. The great law of morality ought to havea national as well as a personal and inual application. We shouldact toward other nations as we wish them to act toward us and justiceand conscience should form the rule of conduct between governments insteadof mere power self interest or the desire of aggrandizement. To maintaina strict neutrality in foreign wars to cultivate friendly relations toreciprocate every noble and generous act and to perform punctually andscrupulously every treaty obligationthese are the duties which we oweto other states and by the performance of which we best entitle ourselvesto like treatment from them; or if that in any case be refused we canenforce our own rights with justice and a clear conscience. In our domestic policy the Constitution will be my gue and in questionsof doubt I shall look for its interpretation to the judicial decisionsof that tribunal which was established to expound it and to the usage ofthe Government sanctioned by the acquiescence of the country. I regardall its provisions as equally binding. In all its parts it is the willof the people expressed in the most solemn form and the constituted authoritiesare but agents to carry that will into effect. Every power which it hasgranted is to be exercised for the public good; but no pretense of utilityno honest conviction even of what might be expedient can justify theassumption of any power not granted. The powers conferred upon the Governmentand their distribution to the several departments are as clearly expressedin that sacred instrument as the imperfection of human language will allowand I deem it my first duty not to question its wisdom add to its provisionsevade its requirements or nullify its commands. Upon you fellowcitizens as the representatives of the States andthe people is wisely devolved the legislative power. I shall comply withmy duty in laying before you from time to time any information calculatedto enable you to discharge your high and responsible trust for the benefitof our common constituents. My opinions will be frankly expressed upon the leading subjects of legislation;and ifwhich I do not anticipateany act should pass the two Houses ofCongress which should appear to me unconstitutional or an encroachmenton the just powers of other departments or with provisions hastily adoptedand likely to produce consequences injurious and unforeseen I should notshrink from the duty of returning it to you with my reasons for yourfurther conseration. Beyond the due performance of these constitutionalobligations both my respect for the Legislature and my sense of proprietywill restrain me from any attempt to control or influence your proceedings.With you is the power the honor and the responsibility of the legislationof the country. The Government of the United States is a limited Government. It is confinedto the exercise of powers expressly granted and such others as may be necessaryfor carrying those powers into effect; and it is at all times an especialduty to guard against any infringement on the just rights of the States.Over the objects and subjects intrusted to Congress its legislative authorityis supreme. But here that authority ceases and every citizen who trulyloves the Constitution and desires the continuance of its existence andits blessings will resolutely and firmly resist any interference in thosedomestic affairs which the Constitution has dearly and unequivocally leftto the exclusive authority of the States. And every such citizen will alsodeprecate useless irritation among the several members of the Union andall reproach and crimination tending to alienate one portion of the countryfrom another. The beauty of our system of government consists and itssafety and durability must consist in avoing mutual collisions and encroachmentsand in the regular separate action of all while each is revolving in itsown distinct orbit. The Constitution has made it the duty of the Present to take carethat the laws be faithfully executed. In a government like ours in whichall laws are passed by a majority of the representatives of the peopleand these representatives are chosen for such short periods that any injuriousor obnoxious law can very soon be repealed it would appear unlikely thatany great numbers should be found ready to resist the execution of thelaws. But it must be borne in mind that the country is extensive; thatthere may be local interests or prejudices rendering a law odious in onepart which is not so in another and that the thoughtless and inconseratemisled by their passions or their imaginations may be induced madly toresist such laws as they disapprove. Such persons should recollect thatwithout law there can be no real practical liberty; that when law is trampledunder foot tyranny rules whether it appears in the form of a militarydespotism or of popular violence. The law is the only sure protection ofthe weak and the only efficient restraint upon the strong. When impartiallyand faithfully administered none is beneath its protection and none aboveits control. You gentlemen and the country may be assured that to theutmost of my ability and to the extent of the power vested in me I shallat all times and in all places take care that the laws be faithfully executed.In the discharge of this duty solemnly imposed upon me by the Constitutionand by my oath of office I shall shrink from no responsibility and shallendeavor to meet events as they may arise with firmness as well as withprudence and discretion. The appointing power is one of the most delicate with which the Executiveis invested. I regard it as a sacred trust to be exercised with the sole of advancing the prosperity and happiness of the people. It shallbe my effort to elevate the standard of official employment by selectingfor places of importance inuals fitted for the posts to which theyare assigned by their known integrity talents and virtues. In so extensivea country with so great a population and where few persons appointedto office can be known to the appointing power mistakes will sometimesuoably happen and unfortunate appointments be made notwithstandingthe greatest care. In such cases the power of removal may be properly exercised;and neglect of duty or malfeasance in office will be no more toleratedin inuals appointed by myself than in those appointed by others. I am happy in being able to say that no unfavorable change in our foreignrelations has taken place since the message at the opening of the <last session of Congress. We are at peace with all nations and we enjoyin an eminent degree the blessings of that peace in a prosperous and<growing commerce and in all the forms of amicable national intercourse.The unexampled growth of the country the present amount of its populationand its ample means of selfprotection assure for it the respect of allnations while it is trusted that its character for justice and a regardto the rights of other States will cause that respect to be readily andcheerfully pa. <A convention was negotiated between the United States and Great Britainin April last for facilitating and protecting the construction of a shipcanal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and for other purposes. Theinstrument has since been ratified by the contracting parties the exchangeof ratifications has been effected and proclamation thereof has been dulymade. In addition to the stipulations contained in this convention two otherobjects remain to be accomplished between the contracting powers: First.The designation and establishment of a free port at each end of the canal. Second. An agreement fixing the distance from the shore within whichbelligerent maritime operations shall not be carried on. On these pointsthere is little doubt that the two Governments will come to an understanding. The company of citizens of the United States who have acquired fromthe State of Nicaragua the privilege of constructing a ship canal betweenthe two oceans through the territory of that State have made progress intheir preliminary arrangements. The treaty between the United States andGreat Britain of the 19th of April last above referred to being now inoperation it is to be hoped that the guaranties which it offers will besufficient to secure the completion of the work with all practicable expedition.It is obvious that this result would be indefinitely postponed if any otherthan peaceful measures for the purpose of harmonizing conflicting claimsto territory in that quarter should be adopted. It will consequently bemy endeavor to cause any further negotiations on the part of this Governmentwhich may be requisite for this purpose to be so conducted as to bringthem to a speedy and successful close. Some uoable delay has occurred arising from distance and the difficultyof intercourse between this Government and that of Nicaragua but as intelligencehas just been received of the appointment of an envoy extraordinary andminister plenipotentiary of that Government to rese at Washington whosearrival may soon be expected it is hoped that no further impediments willbe experienced in the prompt transaction of business between the two Governments. Citizens of the United States have undertaken the connection of thetwo oceans by means of a railroad across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec undergrants of the Mexican Government to a citizen of that Republic. It is understoodthat a thorough survey of the course of the communication is in preparationand there is every reason to expect that it will be prosecuted with characteristicenergy especially when that Government shall have consented to such stipulationswith the Government of the United States as may be necessary to imparta feeling of security to those who may embark their property in the enterprise.Negotiations are pending for the accomplishment of that object and a hopeis confently entertained that when the Government of Mexico shall becomeduly sensible of the advantages which that country can not fail to derivefrom the work and learn that the Government of the United States desiresthat the right of sovereignty of Mexico in the Isthmus shall remain unimpairedthe stipulations referred to will be agreed to with alacrity. By the last advices from Mexico it would appear however that thatGovernment entertains strong objections to some of the stipulations whichthe parties concerned in the project of the railroad deem necessary fortheir protection and security. Further conseration it is to be hopedor some modification of terms may yet reconcile the differences existingbetween the two Governments in this respect. Fresh instructions have recently been given to the minister of the UnitedStates in Mexico who is prosecuting the subject with promptitude and ability. Although the negotiations with Portugal for the payment of claims ofcitizens of the United States against that Government have not yet resultedin a formal treaty yet a proposition made by the Government of Portugalfor the final adjustment and payment of those claims has recently beenaccepted on the part of the United States. It gives me pleasure to saythat Mr. Clay to whom the negotiation on the part of the United Stateshad been intrusted discharged the duties of his appointment with abilityand discretion acting always within the instructions of his Government. It is expected that a regular convention will be immediately negotiatedfor carrying the agreement between the two Governments into effect. Thecommissioner appointed under the act of Congress for carrying into effectthe convention with Brazil of the 27th of January 1849 has entered uponthe performance of the duties imposed upon him by that act. It is hopedthat those duties may be completed within the time which it prescribes.The documents however which the Imperial Government by the third articleof the convention stipulates to furnish to the Government of the UnitedStates have not yet been received. As it is presumed that those documentswill be essential for the correct disposition of the claims it may becomenecessary for Congress to extend the period limited for the duration ofthe commission. The sum stipulated by the fourth article of the conventionto be pa to this Government has been received. The collection in the ports of the United States of discriminating dutiesupon the vessels of Chili and their cargoes has been suspended pursuantto the provisions of the act of Congress of the 24th of May 1828. It isto be hoped that this measure will impart a fresh impulse to the commercebetween the two countries which of late and especially since our acquisitionof California has to the mutual advantage of the parties been much augmented. Peruvian guano has become so desirable an article to the agriculturalinterest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government toemploy all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing thatarticle to be imported into the country at a reasonable price. Nothingwill be omitted on my part toward accomplishing this desirable end. I ampersuaded that in removing any restraints on this traffic the PeruvianGovernment will promote its own best interests while it will afford aproof of a friendly disposition toward this country which will be dulyappreciated. The treaty between the United States and His Majesty the King of theHawaiian Islands which has recently been made public will it is believedhave a beneficial effect upon the relations between the two countries. The relations between those parts of the island of St. Domingo whichwere formerly colonies of Spain and France respectively are still inan unsettled condition. The proximity of that island to the United Statesand the delicate questions involved in the existing controversy there renderit desirable that it should be permanently and speedily adjusted. The interestsof humanity and of general commerce also demand this; and as intimationsof the same sentiment have been received from other governments it ishoped that some plan may soon be devised to effect the object in a mannerlikely to give general satisfaction. The Government of the United Stateswill not fail by the exercise of all proper friendly offices to do allin its power to put an end to the destructive war which has raged betweenthe different parts of the island and to secure to them both the benefitsof peace and commerce. I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for a detailedstatement of the finances. The total receipts into the Treasury for the year ending 30th of Junelast were $47421748.90. The total expenditures during the same periodwere $43002168.90. The public debt has been reduced since the last annualreport from the Treasury Department $495276.79. By the nineteenth section of the act of 28th January 1847 the proceedsof the sales of the public lands were pledged for the interest and principalof the public debt. The great amount of those lands subsequently grantedby Congress for military bounties will it is believed very nearly supplythe public demand for several years to come and but little reliance cantherefore be placed on that hitherto fruitful source of revenue. Asefrom the permanent annual expenditures which have necessarily largelyincreased a portion of the public debt amounting to $8075986.59 mustbe proved for within the next two fiscal years. It is most desirablethat these accruing demands should be met without resorting to new loans. All experience has demonstrated the wisdom and policy of raising a largeportion of revenue for the support of Government from duties on goods imported.The power to lay these duties is unquestionable and its chief objectof course is to replenish the Treasury. But if in doing this an incentaladvantage may be gained by encouraging the industry of our own citizensit is our duty to avail ourselves of that advantage. A duty la upon an article which can not be produced in this countrysuch as tea or coffee adds to the cost of the article and is chieflyor wholly pa by the consumer. But a duty la upon an article which maybe produced here stimulates the skill and industry of our own country toproduce the same article which is brought into the market in competitionwith the foreign article and the importer is thus compelled to reducehis price to that at which the domestic article can be sold thereby throwinga part of the duty upon the producer of the foreign article. The continuanceof this process creates the skill and invites the capital which finallyenable us to produce the article much cheaper than it could have been procuredfrom abroad thereby benefiting both the producer and the consumer at home.The consequence of this is that the artisan and the agriculturist are broughttogether each affords a ready market for the produce of the other thewhole country becomes prosperous and the ability to produce every necessaryof life renders us independent in war as well as in peace. A high tariff can never be permanent. It will cause dissatisfactionand will be changed. It excludes competition and thereby invites the investmentof capital in manufactures to such excess that when changed it brings distressbankruptcy and ruin upon all who have been misled by its faithless protection.What the manufacturer wants is uniformity and permanency that he may feela confence that he is not to be ruined by sudden exchanges. But to makea tariff uniform and permanent it is not only necessary that the laws shouldnot be altered but that the duty should not fluctuate. To effect thisall duties should be specific wherever the nature of the article is suchas to admit of it. Ad valorem duties fluctuate with the price and offerstrong temptations to fraud and perjury. Specific duties on the contraryare equal and uniform in all ports and at all times and offer a stronginducement to the importer to bring the best article as he pays no moreduty upon that than upon one of inferior quality. I therefore stronglyrecommend a modification of the present tariff which has prostrated someof our most important and necessary manufactures and that specific dutiesbe imposed sufficient to raise the requisite revenue making such discriminationsin favor of the industrial pursuits of our own country as to encouragehome production without excluding foreign competition. It is also importantthat an unfortunate provision in the present tariff which imposes a muchhigher duty upon the raw material that enters into our manufactures thanupon the manufactured article should be remedied. The papers accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Treasurywill disclose frauds attempted upon the revenue in variety and amountso great as to justify the conclusion that it is impossible under any systemof ad valorem duties levied upon the foreign cost or value of the articleto secure an honest observance and an effectual administration of the laws.The fraudulent devices to evade the law which have been detected by thevigilance of the appraisers leave no room to doubt that similar impositionsnot discovered to a large amount have been successfully practiced sincethe enactment of the law now in force. This state of things has alreadyhad a prejudicial influence upon those engaged in foreign commerce. Ithas a tendency to drive the honest trader from the business of importingand to throw that important branch of employment into the hands of unscrupulousand dishonest men who are alike regardless of law and the obligationsof an oath. By these means the plain intentions of Congress as expressedin the law are daily defeated. Every motive of policy and duty thereforeimpels me to ask the earnest attention of Congress to this subject. IfCongress should deem it unwise to attempt any important changes in thesystem of levying duties at this session it will become indispensableto the protection of the revenue that such remedies as in the judgmentof Congress may mitigate the evils complained of should be at once applied. As before stated specific duties would in my opinion afford the mostperfect remedy for this evil; but if you should not concur in this then as a partial remedy I beg leave respectfully to recommend that insteadof taking the invoice of the article abroad as a means of determining itsvalue here the correctness of which invoice it is in many cases impossibleto verify the law be so changed as to require a home valuation or appraisalto be regulated in such manner as to give as far as practicable uniformityin the several ports. There being no mint in California I am informed that the laborers inthe mines are compelled to dispose of their gold dust at a large discount.This appears to me to be a heavy and unjust tax upon the labor of thoseemployed in extracting this precious metal and I doubt not you will bedisposed at the earliest period possible to relieve them from it by theestablishment of a mint. In the meantime as an assayer's office is establishedthere I would respectfully submit for your conseration the proprietyof authorizing gold bullion which has been assayed and stamped to be receivedin payment of Government dues. I can not conceive that the Treasury wouldsuffer any loss by such a provision which will at once raise bullion toits par value and thereby save (if I am rightly informed) many millionsof dollars to the laborers which are now pa in brokerage to convert thisprecious metal into available funds. This discount upon their hard earningsis a heavy tax and every effort should be made by the Government to relievethem from so great a burden. More than threefourths of our population are engaged in the cultivationof the soil. The commercial manufacturing and igating interests areall to a great extent dependent on the agricultural. It is therefore themost important interest of the nation and has a just claim to the fosteringcare and protection of the Government so far as they can be extended consistentlywith the provisions of the Constitution. As this can not be done by theordinary modes of legislation I respectfully recommend the establishmentof an agricultural bureau to be charged with the duty of giving to thisleading branch of American industry the encouragement which it so welldeserves. In  of the immense mineral resources of our country provisionshould also be made for the employment of a competent mineralogist andchemist who should be required under the direction of the head of thebureau to collect specimens of the various minerals of our country andto ascertain by careful analysis their respective elements and propertiesand their adaptation to useful purposes. should also be required toexamine and report upon the qualities of different soils and the manuresbest calculated to improve their productiveness. By publishing the resultsof such experiments with suitable explanations and by the collectionand distribution of rare seeds and plants with instructions as to thebest system of cultivation much may be done to promote this great nationalinterest. In compliance with the act of Congress passed on the 23d of May 1850proving among other things for taking the Seventh Census a superintendentwas appointed and all other measures adopted which were deemed necessaryto insure the prompt and faithful performance of that duty. The appropriationalready made will it is believed be sufficient to defray the whole expenseof the work but further legislation may be necessary in regard to thecompensation of some of the marshals of the Territories. It will also beproper to make provision by law at an early day for the publication ofsuch abstracts of the returns as the public interests may require. The unprecedented growth of our territories on the Pacific in wealthand population and the consequent increase of their social and commercialrelations with the Atlantic States seem to render it the duty of the Governmentto use all its constitutional power to improve the means of intercoursewith them. The importance of opening a line of communication the bestand most expeditious of which the nature of the country will admit betweenthe Valley of the Mississippi and the Pacific was brought to your noticeby my predecessor in his annual message; and as the reasons which he presentedin favor of the measure still exist in full force I beg leave to callyour attention to them and to repeat the recommendations then made by him. The uncertainty which exists in regard to the vality of land titlesin California is a subject which demands your early conseration. Largebodies of land in that State are claimed under grants sa to have beenmade by authority of the Spanish and Mexican Governments. Many of thesehave not been perfected others have been revoked and some are believedto be fraudulent. But until they shall have been judicially investigatedthey will continue to retard the settlement and improvement of the country.I therefore respectfully recommend that provision be made by law for theappointment of commissioners to examine all such claims with a  totheir final adjustment. I also beg leave to call your attention to the propriety of extendingat an early day our system of land laws with such modifications as maybe necessary over the State of California and the Territories of Utahand New Mexico. The mineral lands of California will of course form anexception to any general system which may be adopted. Various methods ofdisposing of them have been suggested. I was at first inclined to favorthe system of leasing as it seemed to promise the largest revenue to theGovernment and to afford the best security against monopolies; but furtherreflection and our experience in leasing the lead mines and selling landsupon credit have brought my mind to the conclusion that there would begreat difficulty in collecting the rents and that the relation of debtorand creditor between the citizens and the Government would be attendedwith many mischievous consequences. I therefore recommend that insteadof retaining the mineral lands under the permanent control of the Governmentthey be ed into small parcels and sold under such restrictions asto quantity and time as will insure the best price and guard most effectuallyagainst combinations of capitalists to obtain monopolies. The annexation of Texas and the acquisition of California and New Mexicohave given increased importance to our Indian relations. The various tribesbrought under our jurisdiction by these enlargements of our boundariesare estimated to embrace a population of 124000. Texas and New Mexicoare surrounded by powerful tribes of Indians who are a source of constantterror and annoyance to the inhabitants. Separating into small predatorybands and always mounted they overrun the country devastating farmsdestroying crops driving off whole herds of cattle and occasionally murderingthe inhabitants or carrying them into captivity. The great roads leadinginto the country are infested with them whereby traveling is renderedextremely dangerous and immigration is almost entirely arrested. The Mexicanfrontier which by the eleventh article of the treaty of Guadalupe Halgowe are bound to protect against the Indians within our border is exposedto these incursions equally with our own. The military force stationedin that country although forming a large proportion of the Army is representedas entirely inadequate to our own protection and the fulfillment of ourtreaty stipulations with Mexico. The principal deficiency is in cavalryand I recommend that Congress should at as early a period as practicableprove for the raising of one or more regiments of mounted men. For further suggestions on this subject and others connected with ourdomestic interests and the defense of our frontier I refer you to thereports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Secretary of War. I commend also to your favorable conseration the suggestion containedin the lastmentioned report and in the letter of the General in Chiefrelative to the establishment of an asylum for the relief of disabled anddestitute soldiers. This subject appeals so strongly to your sympathiesthat it would be superfluous in me to say anything more than barely toexpress my cordial approbation of the proposed object. The Navy continues to give protection to our commerce and other nationalinterests in the different quarters of the globe and with the exceptionof a single steamer on the Northern lakes the vessels in commission aredistributed in six different squadrons. The report of the head of that Department will exhibit the servicesof these squadrons and of the several vessels employed in each during thepast year. It is a source of gratification that while they have been constantlyprepared for any hostile emergency they have everywhere met with the respectand courtesy due as well to the dignity as to the peaceful dispositionsand just purposes of the nation. The two brigantines accepted by the Government from a generous citizenof New York and placed under the command of an officer of the Navy to proceedto the Arctic Seas in quest of the British commander Sir John Franklinand his companions in compliance with the act of Congress approved inMay last had when last heard from penetrated into a high northern latitude;but the success of this noble and humane enterprise is yet uncertain. I invite your attention to the  of our present al establishmentand resources presented in the report of the Secretary of the Navy andthe suggestions therein made for its improvement together with the alpolicy recommended for the security of our Pacific Coast and the protectionand extension of our commerce with eastern Asia. Our facilities for a largerparticipation in the trade of the East by means of our recent settlementson the shores of the Pacific are too obvious to be overlooked or disregarded. The questions in relation to rank in the Army and Navy and relativerank between officers of the two branches of the service presented tothe Executive by certain resolutions of the House of Representatives atthe last session of Congress have been submitted to a board of officersin each branch of the service and their report may be expected at an earlyday. I also earnestly recommend the enactment of a law authorizing officersof the Arm
 and Navy to be retired from the service when incompetent forits vigorous and active duties taking care to make suitable provisionfor those who have faithfully served their country and awarding distinctionsby retaining in appropriate commands those who have been particularly conspicuousfor gallantry and good conduct. While the obligation of the country tomaintain and honor those who to the exclusion of other pursuits havedevoted themselves to its arduous service is acknowledged this obligationshould not be permitted to interfere with the efficiency of the serviceitself. I am gratified in being able to state that the estimates of expenditurefor the Navy in the ensuing year are less by more than $1000000 thanthose of the present excepting the appropriation which may become necessaryfor the construction of a dock on the coast of the Pacific propositionsfor which are now being consered and on which a special report may beexpected early in your present session. There is an event justness in the suggestion of the same report thatappropriations for the al service proper should be separated from thosefor fixed and permanent objects such as building docks and y yardsand the fixtures attached and from the extraordinary objects under thecare of the Department which however important are not essentially al. A revision of the code for the government of the Navy seems to requirethe immediate conseration of Congress. Its system of crimes and punishmentshad undergone no change for half a century until the last session thoughits defects have been often and ably pointed out; and the abolition ofa particular species of corporal punishment which then took place withoutproving any substitute has left the service in a state of defectivenesswhich calls for prompt correction. I therefore recommend that the wholesubject be revised without delay and such a system established for theenforcement of discipline as shall be at once humane and effectual. The accompanying report of the PostmasterGeneral presents a satisfactory of the operations and condition of that Department. At the close ofthe last fiscal year the length of the inland mail routes in the UnitedStates (not embracing the service in Oregon and California) was 178672miles the annual transportation thereon 46541423 miles and the annualcost of such transportation $2724426. The increase of the annual transportationover that of the preceding year was 3997354 miles and the increase incost was $342440. The number of postoffices in the United States on the1st day of July last was 18417 being an increase of 1670 during thepreceding year. The gross revenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June30 1850 amounted to $5552971.48 including the annual appropriationof $200000 for the franked matter of the Departments and excluding theforeign postages collected for and payable to the British Government. The expenditures for the same period were $5212953.43 leaving a balanceof revenue over expenditures of $340018.05. I am happy to find that the fiscal condition of the Department is suchas to justify the PostmasterGeneral in recommending the reduction of ourinland letter postage to 3 cents the single letter when prepa and 5 centswhen not prepa. also recommends that the prepa rate shall be reducedto 2 cents whenever the revenues of the Department after the reductionshall exceed its expenditures by more than 5 per cent for two consecutiveyears; that the postage upon California and other letters sent by our oceansteamers shall be much reduced and that the rates of postage on newspaperspamphlets periodicals and other printed matter shall be modified andsome reduction thereon made. It can not be doubted that the proposed reductions will for the presentdiminish the revenues of the Department. It is believed that the deficiencyafter the surplus already accumulated shall be exhausted may be almostwholly met either by abolishing the existing privileges of sending freematter through the mails or by paying out of the Treasury to the PostOfficeDepartment a sum equivalent to the postage of which it is deprived by suchprivileges. The last is supposed to be the preferable mode and will ifnot entirely so nearly supply that deficiency as to make any further appropriationthat may be found necessary so inconserable as to form no obstacle tothe proposed reductions. I entertain no doubt of the authority of Congress to make appropriationsfor leading objects in that  of public works comprising what are usuallycalled works of internal improvement. This authority I suppose to be derivedchiefly from the power of regulating commerce with foreign nations andamong the States and the power of laying and collecting imposts. Wherecommerce is to be carried on and imposts collected there must be portsand harbors as well as wharves and customhouses. If ships laden with valuablecargoes approach the shore or sail along the coast lighthouses are necessaryat suitable points for the protection of life and property. Other facilitiesand securities for commerce and igation are hardly less important; andthose clauses of the Constitution therefore to which I have referredhave received from the origin of the Government a liberal and beneficialconstruction. Not only have lighthouses buoys and beacons been establishedand floating lights maintained but harbors have been cleared and improveiers constructed and even breakwaters for the safety of shipping andsea walls to protect harbors from being filled up and rendered uselessby the action of the ocean have been erected at very great expense. Andthis construction of the Constitution appears the more reasonable fromthe conseration that if these works of such event importance and utilityare not to be accomplished by Congress they can not be accomplished atall. By the adoption of the Constitution the several States voluntarilyparted with the power of collecting duties of imposts in their own portsand it is not to be expected that they should raise money by internal taxationdirect or indirect for the benefit of that commerce the revenues derivedfrom which do not either in whole or in part go into their own treasuries.Nor do I perceive any difference between the power of Congress to makeappropriations for objects of this kind on the ocean and the power to makeappropriations for similar objects on lakes and rivers wherever they arelarge enough to bear on their waters an extensive traffic. The magnificentMississippi and its tributaries and the vast lakes of the North and Northwestappear to me to fall within the exercise of the power as justly and asclearly as the ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a mistake to regardexpenditures judiciously made for these objects as expenditures for localpurposes. The position or sight of the work is necessarily local but itsutility is general. A ship canal around the Falls of St. Mary of less thana mile in length though local in its construction would yet be nationalin its purpose and its benefits as it would remove the only obstructionto a igation of more than 1000 miles affecting several States aswell as our commercial relations with Canada. So too the breakwater atthe mouth of the Delaware is erected not for the exclusive benefit ofthe States bordering on the bay and river of that name but for that ofthe whole coastwise igation of the United States and to a conserableextent also of foreign commerce. If a ship be lost on the bar at the entranceof a Southern port for want of sufficient depth of water it is very likelyto be a Northern ship; and if a steamboat be sunk in any part of the Mississippion account of its channel not having been properly cleared of obstructionsit may be a boat belonging to either of eight or ten States. I may addas somewhat remarkable that among all the thirtyone States there is nonethat is not to a greater or less extent bounded on the ocean or the Gulfof Mexico or one of the Great Lakes or some igable river. In fulfilling our constitutional duties fellowcitizens on this subjectas in carrying into effect all other powers conferred by the Constitutionwe should conser ourselves as deliberating and acting for one and thesame country and bear constantly in mind that our regard and our dutyare due not to a particular part only but to the whole. I therefore recommend that appropriations be made for completing suchworks as have been already begun and for commencing such others as mayseem to the wisdom of Congress to be of public and general importance. The difficulties and delays incent to the settlement of private claimsby Congress amount in many cases to a denial of justice. There is reasonto apprehend that many unfortunate creditors of the Government have therebybeen uoably ruined. Congress has so much business of a public characterthat it is impossible it should give much attention to mere private claimsand their accumulation is now so great that many claimants must despairof ever being able to obtain a hearing. It may well be doubted whetherCongress from the nature of its organization is properly constitutedto dece upon such cases. It is impossible that each member should examinethe merits of every claim on which he is compelled to vote and it is preposterousto ask a judge to dece a case which he has never heard. Such decisionsmay and frequently must do injustice either to the claimant or the Governmentand I perceive no better remedy for this growing evil than the establishmentof some tribunal to adjudicate upon such claims. I beg leave thereforemost respectfully to recommend that provision be made by law for the appointmentof a commission to settle all private claims against the United States;and as an ex parte hearing must in all contested cases be very unsatisfactoryI also recommend the appointment of a solicitor whose duty it shall beto represent the Government before such commission and protect it againstall illegal fraudulent or unjust claims which may be presented for theiradjudication. This District which has neither voice nor vote in your deliberationslooks to you for protection and a and I commend all its wants to yourfavorable conseration with a full confence that you will meet themnot only with justice but with liberality. It should be borne in mindthat in this city la out by Washington and consecrated by his nameis located the Capitol of our nation the emblem of our Union and the symbolof our greatness. Here also are situated all the public buildings necessaryfor the use of the Government and all these are exempt from taxation.It should be the pre of Americans to render this place attractive tothe people of the whole Republic and convenient and safe for the transactionof the public business and the preservation of the public records. TheGovernment should therefore bear a liberal proportion of the burdens ofall necessary and useful improvements. And as nothing could contributemore to the health comfort and safety of the city and the security ofthe public buildings and records than an abundant supply of pure waterI respectfully recommend that you make such provisions for obtaining thesame as in your wisdom you may deem proper. The act passed at your last session making certain propositions toTexas for settling the disputed boundary between that State and the Territoryof New Mexico was immediately on its passage transmitted by express tothe governor of Texas to be la by him before the general assembly forits agreement thereto. Its receipt was duly acknowledged but no officialinformation has yet been received of the action of the general assemblythereon. It may however be very soon expected as by the terms of thepropositions submitted they were to have been acted upon on or before thefirst day of the present month. It was hardly to have been expected that the series of measures passedat your last session with the  of healing the sectional differenceswhich had sprung from the slavery and territorial questions should at oncehave realized their beneficent purpose. All mutual concession in the natureof a compromise must necessarily be unwelcome to men of extreme opinions.And though without such concessions our Constitution could not have beenformed and can not be permanently sustained yet we have seen them madethe subject of bitter controversy in both sections of the Republic. Itrequired many months of discussion and deliberation to secure the concurrenceof a majority of Congress in their favor. It would be strange if they hadbeen received with immediate approbation by people and States prejudicedand heated by the exciting controversies of their representatives. I believethose measures to have been required by the circumstances and conditionof the country. I believe they were necessary to allay asperities and animositiesthat were raply alienating one section of the country from another anddestroying those fraternal sentiments which are the strongest supportsof the Constitution. They were adopted in the spirit of conciliation andfor the purpose of conciliation. I believe that a great majority of ourfellow citizens sympathize in that spirit and that purpose and in themain approve and are prepared in all respects to sustain these enactments.I can not doubt that the American people bound together by kindred bloodand common traditions still cherish a paramount regard for the Union oftheir fathers and that they are ready to rebuke any attempt to violateits integrity to disturb the compromises on which it is based or to resistthe laws which have been enacted under its authority. The series of measures to which I have alluded are regarded by me asa settlement in principle and substancea final settlement of the dangerousand exciting subjects which they embraced. Most of these subjects indeedare beyond your reach as the legislation which disposed of them was inits character final and irrevocable. It may be presumed from the oppositionwhich they all encountered that none of those measures was free from imperfectionsbut in their mutual dependence and connection they formed a system of compromisethe most conciliatory and best for the entire country that could be obtainedfrom conflicting sectional interests and opinions. For this reason I recommend your adherence to the adjustment establishedby those measures until time and experience shall demonstrate the necessityof further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse. By that adjustment we have been rescued from the we and boundlessagitation that surrounded us and have a firm distinct and legal groundto rest upon. And the occasion I trust will justify me in exhorting mycountrymen to rally upon and maintain that ground as the best if not theonly means of restoring peace and quiet to the country and maintaininginviolate the integrity of the Union. And now fellowcitizens I can not bring this communication to a closewithout invoking you to join me in humble and devout thanks to the GreatRuler of Nations for the multiplied blessings which has graciously bestowedupon us. His hand so often visible in our preservation has stayed thepestilence saved us from foreign wars and domestic disturbances and scatterelenty throughout the land. Our liberties religions and civil have been maintained the fountainsof knowledge have all been kept open and means of happiness wely spreadand generally enjoyed greater than have fallen to the lot of any othernation. And while deeply penetrated with gratitude for the past let ushope that His allwise provence will so gue our counsels as that theyshall result in giving satisfaction to our constituents securing the peaceof the country and adding new strength to the united Government underwhich we live. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:< We have continued cause for expressing our gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for the benefits and blessings which our country under His kind provence has enjoyed during the past year. Notwithstanding the exciting scenes through which we have passed nothing has occurred to disturb the general peace or to derange the harmony of our political system. The great moral spectacle has been exhibited of a nation approximating in number to 20000000 people having performed the high and important  of electing their Chief Magistrate for the term of four years without the commission of any acts of violence or the manifestation of a spirit of insubordination to the laws. The great and inestimable right of suffrage has been exercised by all who were invested with it under the laws of the different States in a spirit dictated alone by a desire in the selection of the agent to advance the interests of the country and to place beyond jeopardy the institutions under which it is our happiness to live. That the deepest interest has been manifested by all our countrymen in the result of the election is not less true than highly creditable to them. Vast multitudes have assembled from time to time at various places for the purpose of canvassing the merits and pretensions of those who were presented for their suffrages but no armed soldiery has been necessary to restrain within proper limits the popular zeal or to prevent violent outbreaks. A principle much more controlling was found in the love of order and obedience to the laws which with mere inual exceptions everywhere possesses the American mind and controls with an influence far more powerful than hosts of armed men. We can not dwell upon this picture without recognizing in it that deep and devoted attachment on the part of the people to the institutions under which we live which proclaims their perpetuity. The great objection which has always prevailed against the election by the people of their chief executive officer has been the apprehension of tumults and disorders which might involve in ruin the entire Government. A security against this is found not only in the fact before alluded to but in the additional fact that we live under a Confederacy embracing already twentysix States no one of which has power to control the election. The popular vote in each State is taken at the time appointed by the laws and such vote is announced by the electoral college without reference to the decision of other States. The right of suffrage and the mode of conducting the election are regulated by the laws of each State and the election is distinctly federative in all its prominent features. Thus it is that unlike what might be the results under a consolated system riotous proceedings should they prevail could only affect the elections in single States without disturbing to any dangerous extent the tranquillity of others. The great experiment of a political confederation each member of which is supreme as to all matters appertaining to its local interests and its internal peace and happiness while by a voluntary compact with others it confes to the united power of all the protection of its citizens in matters not domestic has been so far crowned with complete success. The world has witnessed its rap growth in wealth and population and under the gue and direction of a superintending Provence the developments of the past may be regarded but as the shadowing forth of the mighty future. In the bright prospects of that future we shall find as patriots and philanthropists the highest inducements to cultivate and cherish a love of union and to frown down every measure or effort which may be made to alienate the States or the people of the States in sentiment and feeling from each other. A rig and close adherence to the terms of our political compact and above all a sacred observance of the guaranties of the Constitution will preserve union on a foundation which can not be shaken while personal liberty is placed beyond hazard or jeopardy. The guaranty of religious freedom of the freedom of the press of the liberty of speech of the trial by jury of the habeas corpus and of the domestic institutions of each of the States leaving the private citizen in the full exercise of the high and ennobling attributes of his nature and to each State the privilege (which can only be judiciously exerted by itself) of consulting the means best calculated to advance its own happinessthese are the great and important guaranties of the Constitution which the lovers of liberty must cherish and the advocates of union must ever cultivate. Preserving these and avoing all interpolations by forced construction under the guise of an imagined expediency upon the Constitution the influence of our political system is destined to be as actively and as beneficially felt on the distant shores of the Pacific as it is now on those of the Atlantic Ocean. The only formable impediments in the way of its successful expansion (time and space) are so far in the progress of modification by the improvements of the age as to render no longer speculative the ability of representatives from that remote region to come up to the Capitol so that their constituents shall participate in all the benefits of Federal legislation. Thus it is that in the progress of time the inestimable principles of civil liberty will be enjoyed by millions yet unborn and the great benefits of our system of government be extended to now distant and uninhabited regions. In  of the vast wilderness yet to be reclaimed we may well invite the lover of freedom of every land to take up his abode among us and assist us in the great work of advancing the standard of civilization and giving a wer spread to the arts and refinements of cultivated life. Our prayers should evermore be offered up to the Father of the Universe for His wisdom to direct us in the path of our duty so as to enable us to consummate these high purposes.< One of the strongest objections which has been urged against confederacies by writers on government is the liability of the members to be tampered with by foreign governments or the people of foreign states either in their local affairs or in such as affected the peace of others or endangered the safety of the whole confederacy. We can not hope to be entirely exempt from such attempts on our peace and safety. The United States are becoming too important in population and resources not to attract the observation of other nations. It therefore may in the progress of time occur that opinions entirely abstract in the States which they may prevail and in no degree affecting their domestic institutions may be artfully but secretly encouraged with a  to undermine the Union. Such opinions may become the foundation of political parties until at last the conflict of opinion producing an alienation of friendly feeling among the people of the different States may involve in general destruction the happy institutions under which we live. It should ever be borne in mind that what is true in regard to inuals is equally so in regard to states. An interference of one in the affairs of another is the fruitful cause of family dissensions and neighborhood disputes and the same cause affects the peace happiness and prosperity of states. It may be most devoutly hoped that the good sense of the American people will ever be ready to repel all such attempts should they ever be made.< There has been no material change in our foreign relations since my last annual message to Congress. With all the powers of Europe we continue on the most friendly terms. Indeed it affords me much satisfaction to state that at no former period has the peace of that enlightened and important quarter of the globe ever been apparently more firmly established. The conviction that peace is the true policy of nations would seem to be growing and becoming deeper amongst the enlightened everywhere and there is no people who have a stronger interest in cherishing the sentiments and adopting the means of preserving and giving it permanence than those of the United States. Amongst these the first and most effective are no doubt the strict observance of justice and the honest and punctual fulfillment of all engagements. But it is not to be forgotten that in the present state of the world it is no less necessary to be ready to enforce their observance and fulfillment in reference to ourselves than to observe and fulfill them on our part in regard to others.< Since the close of your last session a negotiation has been formally entered upon between the Secretary of State and Her Britannic Majesty's minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary resing at Washington relative to the rights of their respective nations in and over the Oregon Territory. That negotiation is still pending. Should it during your session be brought to a definitive conclusion the result will be promptly communicated to Congress. I would however again call your attention to the recommendations contained in previous messages designed to protect and facilitate emigration to that Territory. The establishment of military posts at suitable points upon the extended line of land travel would enable our citizens to emigrate in comparative safety to the fertile regions below the Falls of the Columbia and make the provision of the existing convention for the joint occupation of the territory by subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States more available than heretofore to the latter. These posts would constitute places of rest for the weary emigrant where he would be sheltered securely against the danger of attack from the Indians and be enabled to recover from the exhaustion of a long line of travel. Legislative enactments should also be made which should spread over him the aegis of our laws so as to afford protection to his person and property when he shall have reached his distant home. In this latter respect the British Government has been much more careful of the interests of such of her people as are to be found in that country than the United States. She has made necessary provision for their security and protection against the acts of the viciously disposed and lawless and her emigrant reposes in safety under the panoply of her laws. Whatever may be the result of the pending negotiation such measures are necessary. It will afford me the greatest pleasure to witness a happy and favorable termination to the existing negotiation upon terms compatible with the public honor and the best efforts of the Government will continue to be directed to this end.< It would have given me the highest gratification in this my last annual communication to Congress to have been able to announce to you the complete and entire settlement and adjustment of other matters in difference between the United States and the Government of Her Britannic Majesty which were adverted to in a previous message. It is so obviously the interest of both countries in respect to the large and valuable commerce which exists between them that all causes of complaint however inconserable should be with the greatest promptitude removed that it must be regarded as cause of regret that any unnecessary delays should be permitted to intervene. It is true that in a pecuniary point of  the matters alluded to are altogether insignificant in amount when compared with the ample resources of that great nation but they nevertheless more particularly that limited  which arise under seizures and detentions of American ships on the coast of Africa upon the mistaken supposition indulged in at the time the wrong was committed of their being engaged in the slave trade deeply affect the sensibilities of this Government and people. Great Britain having recognized her responsibility to repair all such wrongs by her action in other cases leaves nothing to be regretted upon the subject and to all cases arising prior to the treaty of Washington than the delay in making suitable reparation in such of them as fall plainly within the principle of others which she has long since adjusted. The injury inflicted by delays in the settlement of these claims falls with severity upon the inual claimants and makes a strong appeal to her magnanimity and sense of justice for a speedy settlement. Other matters arising out of the construction of existing treaties also remain unadjusted and will continue to be urged upon her attention.< The labors of the joint commission appointed by the two Governments to run the ing line established by the treaty of Washington were unfortunately much delayed in the commencement of the season by the failure of Congress at its last session to make a timely appropriation of funds to meet the expenses of the American party and by other causes. The United States commissioner however expresses his expectation that by increased diligence and energy the party will be able to make up for lost time.< We continue to receive assurances of the most friendly feelings on the part of all the other European powers with each and all of whom it is so obviously our interest to cultivate the most amicable relations; nor can I anticipate the occurrence of any event which would be likely in any degree to disturb those relations. Russia the great northern power under the judicious sway of her Emperor is constantly advancing in the road of science and improvement while France gued by the counsels of her wise Sovereign pursues a course calculated to consolate the general peace. Spain has obtained a breathing spell of some duration from the internal convulsions which have through so many years marred her prosperity while Austria the Netherlands Prussia Belgium and the other powers of Europe reap a rich harvest of blessings from the prevailing peace.< I informed the two Houses of Congress in my message of December last that instructions had been given to Mr. Wheaton our minister at Berlin to negotiate a treaty with the Germanic States composing the Zollverein if it could be done stipulating as far as it was practicable to accomplish it for a reduction of the heavy and onerous duties levied on our tobacco and other leading articles of agricultural production and yielding in return on our part a reduction of duties on such articles the product of their industry as should not come into competition or but a limited one with articles the product of our manufacturing industry. The Executive in giving such instructions consered itself as acting in strict conformity with the wishes of Congress as made known through several measures which it had adopted all directed to the accomplishment of this important result. The treaty was therefore negotiated by which essential reductions were secured in the duties levied by the Zollverein on tobacco rice and lard accompanied by a stipulation for the admission of raw cotton free of duty; in exchange for which highly important concessions a reduction of duties imposed by the laws of the United States on a variety of articles most of which were admitted free of all duty under the act of Congress commonly known as the compromise law and but few of which were produced in the United States was stipulated for on our part. This treaty was communicated to the Senate at an early day of its last session but not acted upon until near its close when for the want (as I am bound to presume) of full time to conser it it was la upon the table. This procedure had the effect of virtually rejecting it in consequence of a stipulation contained in the treaty that its ratifications should be exchanged on or before a day which has already passed. The Executive acting upon the fair inference that the Senate d not intend its absolute rejection gave instructions to our minister at Berlin to reopen the negotiation so far as to obtain an extension of time for the exchange of ratifications. I regret however to say that his efforts in this respect have been unsuccessful. I am nevertheless not without hope that the great advantages which were intended to be secured by the treaty may yet be realized.< I am happy to inform you that Belgium has by an arrete royale issued in July last assimilated the flag of the United States to her own so far as the direct trade between the two countries is concerned. This measure will prove of great service to our shipping interest the trade having heretofore been carried on chiefly in foreign bottoms. I flatter myself that she will speedily resort to a modification of her system relating to the tobacco trade which would decedly benefit the agriculture of the United States and operate to the mutual advantage of both countries.< No definitive intelligence has yet been received from our minister of the conclusion of a treaty with the Chinese Empire but enough is known to induce the strongest hopes that the mission will be crowned with success.< With Brazil our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The commercial intercourse between that growing Empire and the United States is becoming daily of greater importance to both and it is to the interest of both that the firmest relations of amity and good will should continue to be cultivated between them.< The Republic of New Granada still withholds notwithstanding the most persevering efforts have been employed by our charge d'affaires Mr. Blackford to produce a different result indemnity in the case of the brig Morris; and the Congress of Venezuela although an arrangement has been effected between our minister and the minister of foreign affairs of that Government for the payment of $18000 in discharge of its liabilities in the same case has altogether neglected to make provision for its payment. It is to be hoped that a sense of justice will soon induce a settlement of these claims.< Our late minister to Chili Mr. Pendleton has returned to the United States without having effected an adjustment in the second claim of the Macedonian which is delayed on grounds altogether frivolous and untenable. Mr. Pendleton's successor has been directed to urge the claim in the strongest terms and in the event of a failure to obtain a prompt adjustment to report the fact to the Executive at as early a day as possible so that the whole matter may be communicated to Congress.< At your last session I submitted to the attention of Congress the convention with the Republic of Peru of the 17th March 1841 proving for the adjustment of the claims of citizens of the United States against that Republic but no definitive action was taken upon the subject. I again invite to it your attention and prompt action.< In my last annual message I felt it to be my duty to make known to Congress in terms both plain and emphatic my opinion in regard to the war which has so long existed between Mexico and Texas which since the battle of San Jacinto has consisted altogether of predatory incursions attended by circumstances revolting to humanity. I repeat now what I then sa that after eight years of feeble and ineffectual efforts to reconquer Texas it was time that the war should have ceased. The United States have a direct interest in the question. The contiguity of the two nations to our territory was but too well calculated to involve our peace. Unjust suspicions were engendered in the mind of one or the other of the belligerents against us and as a necessary consequence American interests were made to suffer and our peace became daily endangered; in addition to which it must have been obvious to all that the exhaustion produced by the war subjected both Mexico and Texas to the interference of other powers which without the interposition of this Government might eventuate in the most serious injury to the United States. This Government from time to time exerted its friendly offices to bring about a termination of hostilities upon terms honorable alike to both the belligerents. Its efforts in this behalf proved uailing. Mexico seemed almost without an object to persevere in the war and no other alternative was left the Executive but to take advantage of the wellknown dispositions of Texas and to invite her to enter into a treaty for annexing her territory to that of the United States.< Since your last session Mexico has threatened to renew the war and has either made or proposes to make formable preparations for invading Texas. She has issued decrees and proclamations preparatory to the commencement of hostilities full of threats revolting to humanity and which if carried into effect would arouse the attention of all Christendom. This new demonstration of feeling there is too much reason to believe has been produced in consequence of the negotiation of the late treaty of annexation with Texas. The Executive therefore could not be indifferent to such proceedings and it felt it to be due as well to itself as to the honor of the country that a strong representation should be made to the Mexican Government upon the subject. This was accordingly done as will be seen by the copy of the accompanying dispatch from the Secretary of State to the United States envoy at Mexico. Mexico has no right to jeopard the peace of the world by urging any longer a useless and fruitless contest. Such a condition of things would not be tolerated on the European continent. Why should it be on this? A war of desolation such as is now threatened by Mexico can not be waged without involving our peace and tranquillity. It is le to believe that such a war could be looked upon with indifference by our own citizens inhabiting adjoining States; and our neutrality would be violated in despite of all efforts on the part of the Government to prevent it. The country is settled by emigrants from the United States under invitations held out to them by Spain and Mexico. Those emigrants have left behind them friends and relatives who would not fail to sympathize with them in their difficulties and who would be led by those sympathies to participate in their struggles however energetic the action of the Government to prevent it. Nor would the numerous and formable bands of Indians  the most warlike to be found in any land  which occupy the extensive regions contiguous to the States of Arkansas and Missouri and who are in possession of large tracts of country within the limits of Texas be likely to remain passive. The inclinations of those numerous tribes lead them invariably to war whenever pretexts exist.< Mexico had no just ground of displeasure against this Government or people for negotiating the treaty. What interest of hers was affected by the treaty? She was despoiled of nothing since Texas was forever lost to her. The independence of Texas was recognized by several of the leading powers of the earth. She was free to treat free to adopt her own line of policy free to take the course which she believed was best calculated to secure her happiness.< Her Government and people deced on annexation to the United States and the Executive saw in the acquisition of such a territory the means of advancing their permanent happiness and glory. What principle of good faith then was violated? What rule of political morals trampled under foot? So far as Mexico herself was concerned the measure should have been regarded by her as highly beneficial. Her inability to reconquer Texas had been exhibited I repeat by eight (now nine) years of fruitless and ruinous contest. In the meantime Texas has been growing in population and resources. Emigration has flowed into her territory from all parts of the world in a current which continues to increase in strength. Mexico requires a permanent boundary between that young Republic and herself. Texas at no distant day if she continues separate and detached from the United States will inevitably seek to consolate her strength by adding to her domain the contiguous Provinces of Mexico. The spirit of revolt from the control of the central Government has heretofore manifested itself in some of those Provinces and it is fair to infer that they would be inclined to take the first favorable opportunity to proclaim their independence and to form close alliances with Texas. The war would thus be endless or if cessations of hostilities should occur they would only endure for a season. The interests of Mexico therefore could in nothing be better consulted than in a peace with her neighbors which would result in the establishment of a permanent boundary. Upon the ratification of the treaty the Executive was prepared to treat with her on the most liberal basis. Hence the boundaries of Texas were left undefined by the treaty. The Executive proposed to settle these upon terms that all the world should have pronounced just and reasonable. No negotiation upon that point could have been undertaken between the United States and Mexico in advance of the ratification of the treaty. We should have had no right no power no authority to have conducted such a negotiation and to have undertaken it would have been an assumption equally revolting to the pre of Mexico and Texas and subjecting us to the charge of arrogance while to have proposed in advance of annexation to satisfy Mexico for any contingent interest she might have in Texas would have been to have treated Texas not as an independent power but as a mere dependency of Mexico. This assumption could not have been acted on by the Executive without setting at defiance your own solemn declaration that that Republic was an independent State. Mexico had it is true threatened war against the United States in the event the treaty of annexation was ratified. The Executive could not permit itself to be influenced by this threat. It represented in this the spirit of our people who are ready to sacrifice much for peace but nothing to intimation. A war under any circumstances is greatly to be deplored and the United States is the last nation to desire it; but if as the condition of peace it be required of us to forego the unquestionable right of treating with an independent power of our own continent upon matters highly interesting to both and that upon a naked and unsustained pretension of claim by a third power to control the free will of the power with whom we treat devoted as we may be to peace and anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the whole world the Executive does not hesitate to say that the people of the United States would be ready to brave all consequences sooner than submit to such condition. But no apprehension of war was entertained by the Executive and I must express frankly the opinion that had the treaty been ratified by the Senate it would have been followed by a prompt settlement to the entire satisfaction of Mexico of every matter in difference between the two countries. Seeing then that new preparations for hostile invasion of Texas were about to be adopted by Mexico and that these were brought about because Texas had adopted the suggestions of the Executive upon the subject of annexation it could not passively have folded its arms and permitted a war threatened to be accompanied by every act that could mark a barbarous age to be waged against her because she had done so.< Other conserations of a controlling character influenced the course of the Executive. The treaty which had thus been negotiated had failed to receive the ratification of the Senate. One of the chief objections which was urged against it was found to consist in the fact that the question of annexation had not been submitted to the ordeal of public opinion in the United States. However untenable such an objection was esteemed to be in  of the unquestionable power of the Executive to negotiate the treaty and the great and lasting interests involved in the question I felt it to be my duty to submit the whole subject to Congress as the best expounders of popular sentiment. No definitive action having been taken on the subject by Congress the question referred itself directly to the decision of the States and people. The great popular election which has just terminated afforded the best opportunity of ascertaining the will of the States and the people upon it. Pending that issue it became the imperative duty of the Executive to inform Mexico that the question of annexation was still before the American people and that until their decision was pronounced any serious invasion of Texas would be regarded as an attempt to forestall their judgment and could not be looked upon with indifference. I am most happy to inform you that no such invasion has taken place; and I trust that whatever your action may be upon it Mexico will see the importance of decing the matter by a resort to peaceful expedients in preference to those of arms. The decision of the people and the States on this great and interesting subject has been decisively manifested. The question of annexation has been presented nakedly to their conseration. By the treaty itself all collateral and incental issues which were calculated to e and distract the public councils were carefully avoed. These were left to the wisdom of the future to determine. It presented I repeat the isolated question of annexation and in that form it has been submitted to the ordeal of public sentiment. A controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the States have declared in favor of immediate annexation. Instructions have thus come up to both branches of Congress from their respective constituents in terms the most emphatic. It is the will of both the people and the States that Texas shall be annexed to the Union promptly and immediately. It may be hoped that in carrying into execution the public will thus declared all collateral issues may be avoed. Future Legislatures can best dece as to the number of States which should be formed out of the territory when the time has arrived for decing that question. So with all others. By the treaty the United States assumed the payment of the debts of Texas to an amount not exceeding $10000000 to be pa with the exception of a sum falling short of $400000 exclusively out of the proceeds of the sales of her public lands. We could not with honor take the lands without assuming the full payment of all incumbencies upon them.< Nothing has occurred since your last session to induce a doubt that the dispositions of Texas remain unaltered. No intimation of an altered determination on the part of her Government and people has been furnished to the Executive. She still desires to throw herself under the protection of our laws and to partake of the blessings of our federative system while every American interest would seem to require it. The extension of our coastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost incalculable the enlargement of the market for our manufactures a constantly growing market for our agricultural productions safety to our frontiers and additional strength and stability to the Unionthese are the results which would raply develop themselves upon the consummation of the measure of annexation. In such event I will not doubt but that Mexico would find her true interest to consist in meeting the advances of this Government in a spirit of amity. Nor do I apprehend any serious complaint from any other quarter; no sufficient ground exists for such complaint. We should interfere in no respect with the rights of any other nation. There can not be gathered from the act any design on our part to do so with their possessions on this continent. We have interposed no impediments in the way of such acquisitions of territory large and extensive as many of them are as the leading powers of Europe have made from time to time in every part of the world. We seek no conquest made by war. No intrigue will have been resorted to or acts of diplomacy essayed to accomplish the annexation of Texas. Free and independent herself she asks to be received into our Union. It is a question for our own decision whether she shall be received or not.< The two Governments having already agreed through their respective organs on the terms of annexation I would recommend their adoption by Congress in the form of a joint resolution or act to be perfected and made binding on the two countries when adopted in like manner by the Government of Texas.< In order that the subject may be fully presented in all its bearings the correspondence which has taken place in reference to it since the adjournment of Congress between the United States Texas and Mexico is herewith transmitted.< The amendments proposed by the Senate to the convention concluded between the United States and Mexico on the 20th of November 1843 have been transmitted through our minist
r for the concurrence of the Mexican Government but although urged thereto no action has yet been had on the subject nor has any answer been given which would authorize a favorable conclusion in the future.< The decree of September 1843 in relation to the retail trade the order for the expulsion of foreigners and that of a more recent date in regard to passportsall which are consered as in violation of the treaty of amity and commerce between the two countrieshave led to a correspondence of conserable length between the minister for foreign relations and our representatives at Mexico but without any satisfactory result. They remain still unadjusted and many and serious inconveniences have already resulted to our citizens in consequence of them.< Questions growing out of the act of disarming a body of Texan troops under the command of Major Snively by an officer in the service of the United States acting under the orders of our Government and the forcible entry into the customhouse at Bryarlys Landing on Red River by certain citizens of the United States and taking away therefrom the goods seized by the collector of the customs as forfeited under the laws of Texas have been adjusted so far as the powers of the Executive extend. The correspondence between the two Governments in reference to both subjects will be found amongst the accompanying documents. It contains a full statement of all the facts and circumstances with the s taken on both ses and the principles on which the questions have been adjusted. It remains for Congress to make the necessary appropriation to carry the arrangement into effect which I respectfully recommend.< The greatly improved condition of the Treasury affords a subject for general congratulation. The paralysis which had fallen on trade and commerce and which subjected the Government to the necessity of resorting to loans and the issue of Treasury notes to a large amount has passed away and after the payment of upward of $7000000 on account of the interest and in redemption of more than $5000000 of the public debt which falls due on the 1st of January next and setting apart upward of $2000000 for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes and meeting an installment of the debts of the corporate cities of the District of Columbia an estimated surplus of upward of $7000000 over and above the existing appropriations will remain in the Treasury at the close of the fiscal year. Should the Treasury notes continue outstanding as heretofore that surplus will be conserably augmented. Although all interest has ceased upon them and the Government has invited their return to the Treasury yet they remain outstanding affording great facilities to commerce and establishing the fact that under a wellregulated system of finance the Government has resources within itself which render it independent in time of need not only of private loans but also of bank facilities.< The only remaining subject of regret is that the remaining stocks of the Government do not fall due at an earlier day since their redemption would be entirely within its control. As it is it may be well worthy the conseration of Congress whether the law establishing the sinking fund (under the operation of which the debts of the Revolution and last war with Great Britain were to a great extent extinguished) should not with proper modifications so as to prevent an accumulation of surpluses and limited in amount to a specific sum be reenacted. Such provision which would authorize the Government to go into the market for a purchase of its own stock on fair terms would serve to maintain its credit at the highest point and prevent to a great extent those fluctuations in the price of its securities which might under other circumstances affect its credit. No apprehension of this sort is at this moment entertained since the stocks of the Government which but two years ago were offered for sale to capitalists at home and abroad at a depreciation and could find no purchasers are now greatly above par in the hands of the holders; but a wise and prudent forecast admonishes us to place beyond the reach of contingency the public credit.< It must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the existing financial system (resting upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816) the currency of the country has attained a state of perfect soundness; and the rates of exchange between different parts of the Union which in 1841 denoted by their enormous amount the great depreciation and in fact worthlessness of the currency in most of the States are now reduced to little more than the mere expense of transporting specie from place to place and the risk incent to the operation. In a new country like that of the United States where so many inducements are held out for speculation the depositories of the surplus revenue consisting of banks of any description when it reaches any conserable amount require the closest vigilance on the part of the Government. All banking institutions under whatever denomination they may pass are governed by an almost exclusive regard to the interest of the stockholders. That interest consists in the augmentation of profits in the form of ends and a large surplus revenue intrusted to their custody is but too apt to lead to excessive loans and to extravagantly large issues of paper. As a necessary consequence prices are nominally increased and the speculative mania very soon seizes upon the public mind. A fictitious state of prosperity for a season exists and in the language of the day money becomes plenty. Contracts are entered into by inuals resting on this unsubstantial state of things but the delusion speedily passes away and the country is overrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to visit every department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment. The greatest vigilance becomes necessary on the part of Government to guard against this state of things. The depositories must be given distinctly to understand that the favors of the Government will be altogether withdrawn or substantially diminished if its revenues shall be regarded as additions to their banking capital or as the foundation of an enlarged circulation.< The Government through its revenue has at all times an important part to perform in connection with the currency and it greatly depends upon its vigilance and care whether the country be involved in embarrassments similar to those which it has had recently to encounter or aed by the action of the Treasury shall be preserved in a sound and healthy condition.< The dangers to be guarded against are greatly augmented by too large a surplus of revenue. When that surplus greatly exceeds in amount what shall be required by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen contingencies the Legislature itself may come to be seized with a disposition to indulge in extravagant appropriations to objects many of which may and most probably would be found to conflict with the Constitution. A fancied expediency is elevated above constitutional authority and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly follows.< The important power of taxation which when exercised in its most restricted form is a burthen on labor and production is resorted to under various pretexts for purposes having no affinity to the motives which dictated its grant and the extravagance of Government stimulates inual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and illregulated speculation involves one and all in its unfortunate results. In  of such fatal consequences it may be la down as an axiom rounded in moral and political truth that no greater taxes should be imposed than are necessary for an economical administration of the Government and that whatever exists beyond should be reduced or modified. This doctrine does in no way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in the selection of the articles to be taxed which a due regard to the public weal would at all times suggest to the legislative mind. It leaves the range of selection undefined; and such selection should always be made with an eye to the great interests of the country. Composed as is the Union of separate and independent States a patriotic Legislature will not fail in consulting the interests of the parts to adopt such course as will be best calculated to advance the harmony of the whole and thus insure that permanency in the policy of the Government without which all efforts to advance the public prosperity are vain and fruitless.< This great and vitally important task rests with Congress and the Executive can do no more than recommend the general principles which should govern in its execution.< I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War for an exhibition of the condition of the Army and recommend to you as well worthy your best conseration many of the suggestions it contains. The Secretary in no degree exaggerates the great importance of pressing forward without delay in the work of erecting and finishing the fortifications to which he particularly alludes. Much has been done toward placing our cities and roadsteads in a state of security against the hazards of hostile attack within the last four years; but consering the new elements which have been of late years employed in the propelling of ships and the formable implements of destruction which have been brought into service we can not be too active or vigilant in preparing and perfecting the means of defense. I refer you also to his report for a full statement of the condition of the Indian tribes within our jurisdiction. The Executive has abated no effort in carrying into effect the wellestablished policy of the Government which cons a removal of all the tribes resing within the limits of the several States beyond those limits and it is now enabled to congratulate the country at the prospect of an early consummation of this object. Many of the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized life and through the operation of the schools established among them aed by the efforts of the pious men of various religious denominations who devote themselves to the task of their improvement we may fondly hope that the remains of the formable tribes which were once masters of this country will in their transition from the savage state to a condition of refinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to adorn the labors of a welldirected philanthropy.< The accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy will explain to you the situation of that branch of the service. The present organization of the Department imparts to its operations great efficiency but I concur fully in the propriety of a ision of the Bureau of Construction Equipment Increase and Repairs into two bureaus. The subjects as now arranged are incongruous and require to a certain extent information and qualifications altogether dissimilar.< The operations of the squadron on the coast of Africa have been conducted with all due attention to the object which led to its origination and I am happy to say that the officers and crews have enjoyed the best possible health under the system adopted by the officer in command. It is believed that the United States is the only nation which has by its laws subjected to the punishment of death as pirates those who may be engaged in the slave trade. A similar enactment on the part of other nations would not fail to be attended by beneficial results.< In consequence of the difficulties which have existed in the way of securing titles for the necessary grounds operations have not yet been commenced toward the establishment of the yyard at Memphis. So soon as the title is perfected no further delay will be permitted to intervene. It is well worthy of your conseration whether Congress should not direct the establishment of a ropewalk in connection with the cond yyard as a measure not only of economy but as highly useful and necessary. The only establishment of the sort now connected with the service is located at Boston and the advantages of a similar establishment convenient to the hempgrowing region must be apparent to all.< The report of the Secretary presents other matters to your conseration of an important character in connection with the service.< In referring you to the accompanying report of the PostmasterGeneral it affords me continued cause of gratification to be able to advert to the fact that the affairs of the Department for the last four years have been so conducted as from its unaed resources to meet its large expenditures. On my coming into office a debt of nearly $500000 existed against the Department which Congress discharged by an appropriation from the Treasury. The Department on the 4th of March next will be found under the management of its present efficient head free of debt or embarrassment which could only have been done by the observance and practice of the greatest vigilance and economy. The laws have cond throughout that the Department should be selfsustained but it may become necessary with the wisest regard to the public interests to introduce amendments and alterations in the system.< There is a strong desire manifested in many quarters so to alter the tariff of letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present imposed. Should such a measure be carried into effect to the full extent desired it can not well be doubted but that for the first years of its operation a diminished revenue would be collected the supply of which would necessarily constitute a charge upon the Treasury. Whether such a result would be desirable it will be for Congress in its wisdom to determine. It may in general be asserted as true that radical alterations in any system should rather be brought about gradually than by sudden changes and by pursuing this prudent policy in the reduction of letter postage the Department might still sustain itself through the revenue which would accrue by the increase of letters. The state and condition of the public Treasury has heretofore been such as to have precluded the recommendation of any material change. The difficulties upon this head have however ceased and a larger discretion is now left to the Government.< I can not too strongly urge the policy of authorizing the establishment of a line of steamships regularly to ply between this country and foreign ports and upon our own waters for the transportation of the mail. The example of the British Government is well worthy of imitation in this respect. The belief is strongly entertained that the emoluments arising from the transportation of mail matter to foreign countries would operate of itself as an inducement to cause inual enterprise to undertake that branch of the task and the remuneration of the Government would consist in the addition readily made to our steam y in case of emergency by the ships so employed. Should this suggestion meet your approval the propriety of placing such ships under the command of experienced officers of the Navy will not escape your observation. The application of steam to the purposes of al warfare cogently recommends an extensive steam marine as important in estimating the defenses of the country. Fortunately this may be obtained by us to a great extent without incurring any large amount of expenditure. Steam vessels to be engaged in the transportation of the mails on our principal water courses lakes and ports of our coast could also be so constructed as to be efficient as war vessels when needed and would of themselves constitute a formable force in order to repel attacks from abroad.. We can not be blind to the fact that other nations have already added large numbers of steamships to their al armaments and that this new and powerful agent is destined to revolutionize the condition of the world. It becomes the United States therefore looking to their security to adopt a similar policy and the plan suggested will enable them to do so at a small comparative cost.< I take the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony to the zeal and untiring industry which has characterized the conduct of the members of the Executive Cabinet. Each in his appropriate sphere has rendered me the most efficient a in carrying on the Government and it will not I trust appear out of place for me to bear this public testimony. The cardinal objects which should ever be held in  by those intrusted with the administration of public affairs are rigly and without favor or affection so to interpret the national will expressed in the laws as that injustice should be done to none justice to all. This has been the rule upon which they have acted and thus it is believed that few cases if any exist wherein our fellowcitizens who from time to time have been drawn to the seat of Government for the settlement of their transactions with the Government have gone away dissatisfied. Where the testimony has been perfected and was esteemed satisfactory their claims have been promptly audited and this in the absence of all favoritism or partiality. The Government which is not just to its own people can neither claim their affection nor the respect of the world. At the same time the closest attention has been pa to those matters which relate more immediately to the great concerns of the country. Order and efficiency in each branch of the public service have prevailed accompanied by a system of the most rig responsibility on the part of the receiving and disbursing agents. The fact in illustration of the truth of this remark deserves to be noticed that the revenues of the Government amounting in the last four years to upward of $120000000 have been collected and disbursed through the numerous governmental agents without the loss by default of any amount worthy of serious commentary.< The appropriations made by Congress for the improvement of the rivers of the West and of the harbors on the Lakes are in a course of judicious expenditure under suitable agents and are destined it is to be hoped to realize all the benefits designed to be accomplished by Congress. I can not however sufficiently impress upon Congress the great importance of withholding appropriations from improvements which are not ascertained by previous examination and survey to be necessary for the shelter and protection of trade from the dangers of stores and tempests. Without this precaution the expenditures are but too apt to inure to the benefit of inuals without reference to the only conseration which can render them constitutionalthe public interests and the general good.< I can not too earnestly urge upon you the interests of this District over which by the Constitution Congress has exclusive jurisdiction. It would be deeply to be regretted should there be at any time ground to complain of neglect on the part of a community which detached as it is from the parental care of the States of Virginia and Maryland can only expect a from Congress as its local legislature. Amongst the subjects which claim your attention is the prompt organization of an asylum for the insane who may be found from time to time sojourning within the District. Such course is also demanded by conserations which apply to branches of the public service. For the necessities in this behalf I invite your particular attention to the report of the Secretary of the Navy.< I have thus gentlemen of the two Houses of Congress presented you a true and faithful picture of the condition of public affairs both foreign and domestic. The wants of the public service are made known to you and matters of no ordinary importance are urged upon your conseration. Shall I not be permitted to congratulate you on the happy auspices under which you have assembled and at the important change in the condition of things which has occurred in the last three years? During that period questions with foreign powers of vital importance to the peace of our country have been settled and adjusted. A desolating and wasting war with savage tribes has been brought to a close. The internal tranquillity of the country threatened by agitating questions has been preserved. The credit of the Government which had experienced a temporary embarrassment has been thoroughly restored. Its coffers which for a season were empty have been replenished. A currency nearly uniform in its value has taken the place of one depreciated and almost worthless. Commerce and manufactures which had suffered in common with every other interest have once more revived and the whole country exhibits an aspect of prosperity and happiness. Trade and barter no longer governed by a wild and speculative mania rest upon a sol and substantial footing and the rap growth of our cities in every direction bespeaks most strongly the favorable circumstances by which we are surrounded. My happiness in the retirement which shortly awaits me is the ardent hope which I experience that this state of prosperity is neither deceptive nor destined to be short lived and that measures which have not yet received its sanction but which I can not but regard as closely connected with the honor the glory and still more enlarged prosperity of the country are destined at an early day to receive the approval of Congress. Under these circumstances and with these anticipations I shall most gladly leave to others more able than myself the noble and pleasing task of sustaining the public prosperity. I shall carry with me into retirement the gratifying reflection that as my sole object throughout has been to advance the public good I may not entirely have failed in accomplishing it; and this gratification is heightened in no small degree by the fact that when under a deep and abing sense of duty I have found myself constrained to resort to the qualified veto it has neither been followed by disapproval on the part of the people nor weakened in any degree their attachment to that great conservative feature of our Government.< 
To the Senate and House of Representatives:< I transmit herewith copies of dispatches received from our minister at Mexico since the commencement of your present session which claim from their importance and I doubt not will receive your calm and deliberate conseration. The extraordinary and highly offensive language which the Mexican Government has thought proper to employ in reply to the remonstrance of the Executive through Mr. Shannon against the renewal of the war with Texas while the question of annexation was pending before Congress and the people and also the proposed manner of conducting that war will not fail to arrest your attention. Such remonstrance urged in no unfriendly spirit to Mexico was called for by conserations of an imperative character having relation as well to the peace of this country and honor of this Government as to the cause of humanity and civilization. Texas had entered into the treaty of annexation upon the invitation of the Executive and when for that act she was threatened with a renewal of the war on the part of Mexico she naturally looked to this Government to interpose its efforts to ward off the threatened blow. But one course was left the Executive acting within the limits of its constitutional competency and that was to pro test in respectful but at the same time strong and deced terms against it. The war thus threatened to be renewed was promulgated by edicts and decrees which ordered on the part of the Mexican military the desolation of whole tracts of country and the destruction without discrimination of all ages sexes and conditions of existence. Over the manner of conducting war Mexico possesses no exclusive control. She has no right to violate at pleasure the principles which an enlightened civilization has la down for the conduct of nations at war and thereby retrograde to a period of barbarism which happily for the world has long since passed away. All nations are interested in enforcing an observance of those principles and the United States the oldest of the American Republics and the nearest of the civilized powers to the theater on which these enormities were proposed to be enacted could not quietly content themselves to witness such a state of things. They had through the Executive on another occasion and as was believed with the approbation of the whole country remonstrated against outrages similar but even less inhuman than those which by her new edicts and decrees she has threatened to perpetrate and of which the late inhuman massacre at Tabasco was but the precursor.< The bloody and inhuman murder of Fannin and his companions equaled only in savage barbarity by the usages of the untutored Indian tribes proved how little confence could be placed on the most solemn stipulations of her generals while the fate of others who became her captives in warmany of whom no longer able to sustain the fatigues and privations of long journeys were shot down by the wayse while their companions who survived were subjected to sufferings even more painful than deathhad left an indelible stain on the page of civilization. The Executive with the evence of an intention on the part of Mexico to renew scenes so revolting to humanity could do no less than renew remonstrances formerly urged. For fulfilling duties so imperative Mexico has thought proper through her accredited organs because she has had represented to her the inhumanity of such proceedings to indulge in language unknown to the courtesy of diplomatic intercourse and offensive in the highest degree to this Government and people. Nor has she offended in this only. She has not only violated existing conventions between the two countries by arbitrary and unjust decrees against our trade and intercourse but withholds installments of debt due to our citizens which she solemnly pledged herself to pay under circumstances which are fully explained by the accompanying letter from Mr. Green our secretary of legation. And when our minister has invited the attention of her Government to wrongs committed by her local authorities not only on the property but on the persons of our fellowcitizens engaged in prosecuting fair and honest pursuits she has added insult to injury by not even deigning for months together to return an answer to his representations. Still further to manifest her unfriendly feelings toward the United States she has issued decrees expelling from some of her Provinces American citizens engaged in the peaceful pursuits of life and now denies to those of our citizens prosecuting the whale fishery on the northwest coast of the Pacific the privilege which has through all time heretofore been accorded to them of exchanging goods of a small amount in value at her ports in California for supplies indispensable to their health and comfort.< Nor will it escape the observation of Congress that in conducting a correspondence with a minister of the United States who can not and does not know any distinction between the geographical sections of the Union charges wholly unfounded are made against particular States and an appeal to others for a and protection against supposed wrongs. In this same connection sectional prejudices are attempted to be excited and the hazardous and unpardonable effort is made to foment isions amongst the States of the Union and thereby imbitter their peace. Mexico has still to learn that however freely we may indulge in discussion among ourselves the American people will tolerate no interference in their domestic affairs by any foreign government and in all that concerns the constitutional guaranties and the national honor the people of the United States have but one mind and one heart.< The subject of annexation addresses itself most fortunately to every portion of the Union. The Executive would have been unmindful of its highest obligations if it could have adopted a course of policy dictated by sectional interests and local feelings. On the contrary it was because the question was neither local nor sectional but made its appeal to the interests of the whole Union and of every State in the Union that the negotiation and finally the treaty of annexation was entered into; and it has afforded me no ordinary pleasure to perceive that so far as demonstrations have been made upon it by the people they have proceeded from all portions of the Union. Mexico may seek to excite isions amongst us by uttering unjust denunciations against particular States but when she comes to know that the invitations addressed to our fellowcitizens by Spain and afterwards by herself to settle Texas were accepted by emigrants from all the States and when in addition to this she refreshes her recollection with the fact that the first effort which was made to acquire Texas was during the Administration of a distinguished citizen from an Eastern State which was afterwards renewed under the auspices of a Present from the Southwest she will awake to a knowledge of the futility of her present purpose of sowing dissensions among us or producing distraction in our councils by attach either on particular States or on persons who are now in the retirement of private life.< Consering the appeal which she now makes to eminent citizens by name can she hope to escape censure for having ascribed to them as well as to others a design as she pretends now for the first time revealed of having originated negotiations to despoil her by duplicity and falsehood of a portion of her territory? The opinion then as now prevailed with the Executive that the annexation of Texas to the Union was a matter of vast importance in order to acquire that territory before it had assumed a position among the independent powers of the earth propositions were made to Mexico for a cession of it to the United States. Mexico saw in these proceedings at the time no cause of complaint. She is now when simply reminded of them awakened to the knowledge of the fact which she through her secretary of state promulgates to the whole world as true that those negotiations were founded in deception and falsehood and superinduced by unjust and iniquitous motives. While Texas was a dependency of Mexico the United States opened negotiations with the latter power for the cession of her then acknowledged territory and now that Texas is independent of Mexico and has maintained a separate existence for nine years during which time she has been received into the family of nations and is represented by accredited ambassadors at many of the principal Courts of Europe and when it has become obvious to the whole world that she is forever lost to Mexico the United States is charged with deception and falsehood in all relating to the past and condemnatory accusations are made against States which have had no special agency in the matter because the Executive of the whole Union has negotiated with free and independent Texas upon a matter vitally important to the interests of both countries; and after nine years of uailing war Mexico now announces her intention through her secretary of foreign affairs never to consent to the independence of Texas or to abandon the effort to reconquer that Republic. She thus announces a perpetual claim which at the end of a century will furnish her as plausible a ground for discontent against any nation which at the end of that time may enter into a treaty with Texas as she possesses at this moment against the United States. The lapse of time can add nothing to her title to independence.< A course of conduct such as has been described on the part of Mexico in violation of all friendly feeling and of the courtesy which should characterize the intercourse between the nations of the earth might well justify the United States in a resort to any measures to vindicate their national honor; but actuated by a sincere desire to preserve the general peace and in  of the present condition of Mexico the Executive resting upon its integrity and not fearing but that the judgment of the world will duly appreciate its motives abstains from recommending to Congress a resort to measures of redress and contents itself with reurging upon that body prompt and immediate action on the subject of annexation. By adopting that measure the United States will be in the exercise of an undoubted right; and if Mexico not regarding their forbearance shall aggravate the injustice of her conduct by a declaration of war against them upon her head will rest all the responsibility.< 
Called from a retirement which I had supposed was to continue for the resue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation I appear before you fellowcitizens to take the oaths which the Constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification for the performance of its duties; and in obedience to a custom coeval with our Government and what I believe to be your expectations I proceed to present to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the discharge of the duties which I shall be called upon to perform. < It was the remark of a Roman consul in an early period of that celebrated Republic that a most striking contrast was observable in the conduct of candates for offices of power and trust before and after obtaining them they seldom carrying out in the latter case the pledges and promises made in the former. However much the world may have improved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years since the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant Roman I fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confence. < Although the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the Chief Magistrate of this glorious Union nothing upon their part remaining to be done it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions; and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those I shall now deliver or approving them to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered. But the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their fears. The outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by an Administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable history and I shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or ed with the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray. However strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confing people I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief confence upon the a of that Almighty Power which has hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important but still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confed to me by my country. < The broad foundation upon which our Constitution rests being the people—a breath of theirs having made as a breath can unmake change or modify it—it can be assigned to none of the great isions of government but to that of democracy. If such is its theory those who are called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle the duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number. But with these broad admissions if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people with the power claimed by other sovereignties even by those which have been consered most purely democratic we shall find a most essential difference. All others lay claim to power limited only by their own will. The majority of our citizens on the contrary possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has been granted to them by the parties to the national compact and nothing beyond. We admit of no government by ine right believing that so far as power is concerned the Beneficent Creator has made no distinction amongst men; that all are upon an equality and that the only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed. The Constitution of the United States is the instrument containing this grant of power to the several departments composing the Government. On an examination of that instrument it will be found to contain declarations of power granted and of power withheld. The latter is also susceptible of ision into power which the majority had the right to grant but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agents and that which they could not have granted not being possessed by themselves. In other words there are certain rights possessed by each inual American citizen which in his compact with the others he has never surrendered. Some of them indeed he is unable to surrender being in the language of our system unalienable. The boasted privilege of a Roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of Athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith—which no one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of all—or the banishment from his home his family and his country with or without an alleged cause that it was the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy but of his assembled countrymen. Far different is the power of our sovereignty. It can interfere with no one's faith prescribe forms of worship for no one's observance inflict no punishment but after wellascertained guilt the result of investigation under rules prescribed by the Constitution itself. These precious privileges and those scarcely less important of giving expression to his thoughts and opinions either by writing or speaking unrestrained but by the liability for injury to others and that of a full participation in all the advantages which flow from the Government the acknowledged property of all the American citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellowman. claims them because he is himself a man fashioned by the same Almighty hand as the rest of his species and entitled to a full share of the blessings with which has endowed them. Notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of the United Stages and the restricted grant of power to the Government which they have adopted enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created. It has been found powerful in war and hitherto justice has been administered and intimate union effected domestic tranquillity preserved and personal liberty secured to the citizen. As was to be expected however from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the Constitution is written disputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually granted or was intended to grant. < This is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treats of the legislative branch and not only as regards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving that body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the specified powers but in relation to the latter also. It is however consolatory to reflect that most of the instances of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the Constitution have ultimately received the sanction of a majority of the people. And the fact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on both ses of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference that the errors if errors there were are attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers of the Constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive. But the great danger to our institutions does not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the Government of power not granted by the people but by the accumulation in one of the departments of that which was assigned to others. Limited as are the powers which have been granted still enough have been granted to constitute a despotism if concentrated in one of the departments. This danger is greatly heightened as it has been always observable that men are less jealous of encroachments of one department upon another than upon their own reserved rights. When the Constitution of the United States first came from the hands of the Convention which formed it many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power which had been granted to the Federal Government and more particularly of that portion which had been assigned to the executive branch. There were in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their eas of a simple representative democracy or republic and knowing the tendency of power to increase itself particularly when exercised by a single inual predictions were made that at no very remote period the Government would terminate in virtual monarchy. It would not become me to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized; but as I sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men's opinions for some years past has been in that direction it is I conceive strictly proper that I should take this occasion to repeat the assurances I have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exists and restore the Government to its pristine health and vigor as far as this can be effected by any legitimate exercise of the power placed in my hands. < I proceed to state in as summary a manner as I can my opinion of the sources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and the correctives which may be applied. Some of the former are unquestionably to be found in the defects of the Constitution; others in my judgment are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provisions. Of the former is the eligibility of the same inual to a second term of the Presency. The sagacious mind of Mr. Jefferson early saw and lamented this error and attempts have been made hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the States to its correction. As however one mode of correction is in the power of every Present and consequently in mine it would be useless and perhaps invious to enumerate the evils of which in the opinion of many of our fellowcitizens this error of the sages who framed the Constitution may have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to gather from it if it continues to disfigure our system. It may be observed however as a general remark that republics can commit no greater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of government which may be calculated to create or increase the lover of power in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit the management of their affairs; and surely nothing is more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust. Nothing can be more corrupting nothing more destructive of all those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot. When this corrupting passion once takes possession of the human mind like the love of gold it becomes insatiable. It is the neverdying worm in his bosom grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim. If this is true it is the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations the execution of her laws and the command of her armies and ies to a period so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable agent not the principal; the servant not the master. Until an amendment of the Constitution can be effected public opinion may secure the desired object. I give my a to it by renewing the pledge heretofore given that under no circumstances will I consent to serve a second term. < But if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects of the Constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the Executive power in the same hands there is I apprehend not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers actually given. I can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the Present a part of the legislative power. It can not be claimed from the power to recommend since although enjoined as a duty upon him it is a privilege which he holds in common with every other citizen; and although there may be something more of confence in the propriety of the measures recommended in the one case than in the other in the obligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference. In the language of the Constitution all the legislative powers which it grants are vested in the Congress of the United States. It would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in the whole. < It may be sa indeed that the Constitution has given to the Executive the power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent. So a similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary forms no part of the Legislature. There is it is true this difference between these grants of power: The Executive can put his negative upon the acts of the Legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the Constitution whilst the judiciary can only declare vo those which violate that instrument. But the decision of the judiciary is final in such a case whereas in every instance where the veto of the Executive is applied it may be overcome by a vote of twothirds of both Houses of Congress. The negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive authority and that in the hands of one inual would seem to be an incongruity in our system. Like some others of asimilar character however it appears to be highly expedient and if used only with the forbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may be productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to the Union. At the period of the formation of the Constitution the principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the State governments. It existed but in two and in one of these there was a plural executive. If we would search for the motives which operated upon the purely patriotic and nlightened assembly which framed the Constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the leading democratic principle that the majority should govern we must reject the ea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation. They knew too well the high degree of intelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened character of the State legislatures not to have the fullest confence that the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of such constituents and of course that they would require no a in conceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the country might require. And it is preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have been entertained that the Present placed at the capital in the center of the country could better understand the wants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives who spend a part of every year among them living with them often laboring with them and bound to them by the triple tie of interest duty and affection. To assist or control Congress then in its ordinary legislation could not I conceive have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the Present. This argument acquires additional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the first six Presentsand two of them were members of the Convention one presing over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger share in consummating the labors of that august body than any other person. But if bills were never returned to Congress by either of the Presents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient or not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people the veto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the Constitution or because errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment. < There is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle which had probably more influence in recommending it to the Convention than any other. I refer to the security which it gives to the just and equitable action of the Legislature upon all parts of the Union. It could not but have occurred to the Convention that in a country so extensive embracing so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of products and which from the same causes must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various sections calling for a great ersity in the employments of the people that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interests of the minority and that acts of this character might be passed under an express grant by the words of the Constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare vo; that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the members of Congress might be and however largely partaking in the general of the liberal feelings of the people it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings. It was proper therefore to prove some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influences might be expected. Such a one was afforded by the executive department constituted by the Constitution. A person elected to that high office having his constituents in every section State and subision of the Union must conser himself bound by the most solemn sanctions to guard protect and defend the rights of all and of every portion great or small from the injustice and oppression of the rest. I conser the veto power therefore given by the Constitution to the Executive of the United States solely as a conservative power to be used only first to protect the Constitution from violation; secondly the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has been probably disregarded or not well understood and thirdly to prevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of minorities. In reference to the second of these objects I may observe that I conser it the right and privilege of the people to dece disputed points of the Constitution arising from the general grant of power to Congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given; and I believe with Mr. Madison that repeated recognitions under varied circumstances in acts of the legislative executive and judicial branches of the Government accompanied by indications in different modes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as affording to the Present sufficient authority for his consering such disputed points as settled. < Upward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present form of government. It would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise situation could be ascertained a fair exhibit made of the operations of each of its departments of the powers which they respectively claim and exercise of the collisions which have occurred between them or between the whole Government and those of the States or either of them. We could then compare our actual condition after fifty years' trial of our system with what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain whether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the confent hopes of its advocates have been best realized. The great dread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the States would be absorbed by those of the Federal Government and a consolated power established leaving to the States the shadow only of that independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on the preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty. Without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of being realized it is obvious that they d not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment The General Government has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the States. AS far as any open warfare may have gone the State authorities have amply maintained their rights. To a casual observer our system presents no appearance of discord between the different members which compose it. Even the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring. They move in their respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other. But there is still an undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably checked the worst apprehensions of our antifederal patriots will be realized and not only will the State authorities be overshadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department of the General Government but the character of that Government if not its designation be essentially and radically changed. This state of things has been in part effected by causes inherent in the Constitution and in part by the neverfailing tendency of political power to increase itself. By making the Present the sole distributer of all the patronage of the Government the framers of the Constitution do not appear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a formable instrument to control the free operations of the State governments. Of trifling importance at first it had early in Mr. Jefferson's Administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise. If such could have then been the effects of its influence how much greater must be the danger at this time quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more completely under the control of the Executive will than their construction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all the early Presents permitted them to make. But it is not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department has become dangerous but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country. The Constitution has declared it to be the duty of the Present to see that the laws are executed and it makes him the Commander in Chief of the Armies and Navy of the United States. If the opinion of the most approved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern Europe is termed monarchy in contradistinction to despotism is correct there was wanting no other addition to the powers of our Chief Magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our Government but the control of the public finances; and to me it appears strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the Present possesses over the officers who have the custody of the public money by the power of removal with or without cause does for all mischievous purposes at least virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal. The first Roman Emperor in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword. By a selection of political instruments for the care of the public money a reference to their commissions by a Present would be quite as effectual an argument as that of Caesar to the Roman knight. I am not insensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenues and I know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the orce as it is called of the Treasury from the banking institutions. It is not the orce which is complained of but the unhallowed union of the Treasury with the executive department which has created such extensive alarm. To this danger to our republican institutions and that created by the influence given to the Executive through the instrumentality of the Federal officers I propose to apply all the remedies which may be at my command. It was certainly a great error in the framers of the Constitution not to have made the officer at the head of the Treasury Department entirely independent of the Executive. should at least have been removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the Legislature. I have determined never to remove a Secretary of the Treasury without communicating all the circumstances attending such removal to both Houses of Congress. < The influence of the Executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by Mr. Jefferson forbding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments. Never with my consent shall an officer of the people compensated for his services out of their pockets become the pliant instrument of Executive will. < There is no part of the means placed in the hands of the Executive which might be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the control of the public press. The maxim which our ancestors derived from the mother country that the freedom of the press is the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty is one of the most precious legacies which they have left us. We have learned too from our own as well as the experience of other countries that golden shackles by whomsoever or by whatever pretense imposed are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of despotism. The presses in the necessary employment of the Government should never be used to clear the guilty or to varnish crime. A decent and manly examination of the acts of the Government should be not only tolerated but encouraged. < Upon another occasion I have given my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of Executive interference in the legislation of Congress—that the article in the Constitution making it the duty of the Present to communicate information and authorizing him to recommend measures was not intended to make him the source in legislation and in particular that he should never be looked to for schemes of finance. It would be very strange indeed that the Constitution should have strictly forbden one branch of the Legislature from interfering in the origination of such bills and that it should be consered proper that an altogether different department of the Government should be permitted to do so. Some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle. There are others however which can not be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this I conceive to be one. No matter in which of the houses of Parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced—a minister or a member of the opposition—by the fiction of law or rather of Constitutional principle the sovereign is supposed to have prepared it agreeably to his will and then submitted it to Parliament for their advice and consent. Now the very reverse is the case here not only with regard to the principle but the forms prescribed by the Constitution. The principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the Constitution (the legislative body) the power to make laws and the forms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them. The Senate in relation to revenue bills have the right to propose amendments and so has the Executive by the power given him to return them to the House of Representatives with his objections. It is in his power also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws suggested by his observations upon their defective or injurious operation. But the delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the Constitution has placed it—with the immediate representatives of the people. For similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure should be prescribed by them and the further removed it may be from the control of the Executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle. < Connected with this subject is the character of the currency. The ea of making it exclusively metallic however well intended appears to me to be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having no relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been devised. If any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellowcitizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth that is the one. If there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things so much deprecated by all true republicans by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury it is an exclusive metallic currency. Or if there is a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury it is an exclusive metallic currency. < Amongst the other duties of a delicate character which the Present is called upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the Territories of the United States. Those of them which are destined to become members of our great political family are compensated by their rap progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political rights. It is in this District only where American citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future. Their only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp—that their sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within. Are there any of their countrymen who would subject them to greater sacrifices to any other humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they were thus separated from their fellowcitizens? Are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the application of those great principles upon which all our Constitutions are founded? We are told by the greatest of British orators and statesmen that at the commencement of the War of the Revolution the most stup men in England spoke of their American subjects. Are there indeed citizens of any of our States who have dreamed of their subjects in the District of Columbia? Such dreams can never be realized by any agency of mine. The people of the District of Columbia are not the subjects of the people of the States but free American citizens. Being in the latter condition when the Constitution was formed no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character. If there is anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our Declaration of Independence they could neither make nor the United States accept a surrender of their liberties and become the subjects—in other words the slaves—of their former fellowcitizens. If this be true—and it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct ea of his own rights as an American citizen—the grant to Congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia can be interpreted so far as respects the aggregate people of the United States as meaning nothing more than to allow to Congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the s assigned to the General Government by the Constitution. In all other respects the legislation of Congress should be adapted to their peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their deliberate opinions of their own interests. < I have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of the Government as well as all the other authorities of our country within their appropriate orbits. This is a matter of difficulty in some cases as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined by any distinct lines. Mischievous however in their tendencies as collisions of this kind may be those which arise between the respective communities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more so for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states. Strong as is the tie of interest it has been often found in
ffectual. Men blinded by their passions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestions of policy. The alternative then is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good one and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our American political architects have reared the fabric of our Government. The cement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the affectionate attachment between all its members. To insure the continuance of this feeling produced at first by a community of dangers of sufferings and of interests the advantages of each were made accessible to all. No participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive Confederacy except in domestic government was withheld from the citizen of any other member. By aprocess attended with no difficulty no delay no expense but that of removal the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other and successively of the whole. The lines too separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one State from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding. The citizens of each State unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the United States but in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen of two separate States and he is therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserved powers of any State but that of which he is for the time being a citizen. may indeed offer to the citizens of other States his advice as to their management and the form in which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of propriety. It may be observed however that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of Athens to her allies supported by an armed and powerful fleet. It was indeed to the ambition of the leading States of Greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the destruction of that celebrated Confederacy and subsequently of all its members is mainly to be attributed and it is owing to the absence of that spirit that the Helvetic Confederacy has for so many years been preserved. Never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate members of any confederacy more elements of discord. In the principles and forms of government and religion as well as in the circumstances of the several Cantons so marked a discrepancy was observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance and yet for ages neither has been interrupted. Content with the positive benefits which their union produced with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secured these sagacious people respected the institutions of each other however repugnant to their own principles and prejudices. < Our Confederacy fellowcitizens can only be preserved by the same forbearance. Our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the Constitution clothes them. The attempt of those of one State to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of distrust and jealousy the certain harbingers of disunion violence and civil war and the ultimate destruction of our free institutions. Our Confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership There is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied members but that which has been reserved by the inual members is intangible by the common Government or the inual members composing it. To attempt it finds no support in the principles of our Constitution. < It should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our Confederacy. Experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by citizens of one part of the Union of a subject not confed to the General Government but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authorities is productive of no other consequences than bitterness alienation discord and injury to the very cause which is intended to be advanced. Of all the great interests which appertain to our country that of unioncordial confing fraternal union—is by far the most important since it is the only true and sure< guaranty of all others. < In consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency some of the States may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns. However deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagements into which States have entered for purposes of their own it does not become us to disparage the States governments nor to discourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief. On the contrary it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our Constitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their engagements and maintain their credit for the character and credit of the several States form a part of the character and credit of the whole country. The resources of the country are abundant the enterprise and activity of our people proverbial and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective governments each acting within its own sphere will restore former prosperity. < Unpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the constituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to the lines which separate their respective jurisdictions the results can be of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism that devoted attachment to liberty that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished continue to be cherished. If this continues to be the ruling passion of our souls the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected the Utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated and the complicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless. The spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive. On the contrary no care that can be used in the construction of our Government no ision of powers no distribution of checks in its several departments will prove effectual to keep us a free people if this spirit is suffered to decay; and decay it will without constant nurture. To the neglect of this duty the best historians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose existence and fall their writings have made us acquainted. The same causes will ever produce the same effects and as long as the love of power is a dominant passion of the human bosom and as long as the understandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by operations upon their passions and prejudices so long will the liberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation. The danger to all wellestablished free governments arises from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of designing men erting their attention from the quarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come. This is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their country. In the name of democracy they speak warning the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy. History ancient and modern is full of such examples. Caesar became the master of the Roman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the democratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter; Cromwell in the character of protector of the liberties of the people became the dictator of England and Bolivar possessed himself of unlimited power with the title of his country's liberator. There is on the contrary no instance on record of an extensive and well established republic being changed into an aristocracy. The tendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy and the antagonist principle to liberty there is the spirit of faction—a spirit which assumes the character and in times of great excitement imposes itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom and like the false Christs whose coming was foretold by the Savior seeks to and were it possible would impose upon the true and most faithful disciples of liberty. It is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power. And although there is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the false from the true spirit a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit as well by the character of its operations as the results that are produced. The true spirit of liberty although devoted persevering bold and uncompromising in principle that secured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs whilst the spirit of party assuming to be that of liberty is harsh vindictive and intolerant and totally reckless as to the character of the allies which it brings to the a of its cause. When the genuine spirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affairs it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments of the government and restores the system to its pristine health and beauty. But the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and established amst unusual professions of devotion to democracy. < The foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected with our domestic concerns. It may be proper however that I should give some indications to my fellowcitizens of my proposed course of conduct in the management of our foreign relations. I assure them therefore that it is my intention to use every means in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with every foreign nation and that although of course not well informed as to the state of pending negotiations with any of them I see in the personal characters of the sovereigns as well as in the mutual interests of our own and of the governments with which our relations are most intimate a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the interests of their subjects as well as of our citizens will not be interrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their part to which our honor would not permit us to yield. Long the defender of my country's rights in the field I trust that my fellowcitizens will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers any indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of the nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their Chief Magistrate unworthy of their former glory. In our intercourse with our aboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the course prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when acting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed. I can conceive of no more sublime spectacle none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common Creator than a rig adherence to the principles of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with aweaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its disposal. < Before concluding fellowcitizens I must say something to you on the subject of the parties at this time existing in our country. To me it appears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that the violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time governed must be greatly mitigated if not entirely extinguished or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of. < If parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public aries within the bounds of law and duty at that point their usefulness ends. Beyond that they become destructive of public virtue the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty and eventually its inevitable conqueror. We have examples of republics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citizens and yet with the continuance of the name and forms of free government not a vestige of these qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens. It was the beautiful remark of a distinguished English writer that in the Roman senate Octavius had a party and Anthony a party but the Commonwealth had none. Yet the senate continued to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the Commonwealth and gaze at the statues of the elder Brutus and of the Curtii and Decii and the people assembled in the forum not as in the days of Camillus and the Scipios to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass upon the acts of the senate but to receive from the hands of the leaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout for one or the other as those collected in Gaul or Egypt and the lesser Asia would furnish the larger end. The spirit of liberty had fled and avoing the abodes of civilized man had sought protection in the wilds of Scythia or Scandiia; and so under the operation of the same causes and influences it will fly from our Capitol and our forums. A calamity so awful not only to our country but to the world must be deprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things likely to produce it immediately checked. Such a tendency has existed—does exist. Always the friend of my countrymen never their flatterer it becomes my duty to say to them from this high place to which their partiality has exalted me that there exists in the land a spirit hostile to their best interests—hostile to liberty itself. It is a spirit contracted in its s selfish in its objects. It looks to the aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interests of the whole. The entire remedy is with the people. Something however may be effected by the means which they have placed in my hands. It is union that we want not of a party for the sake of that party but aunion of the whole country for the sake of the whole country for the defense of its interests and its honor against foreign aggression for the defense of those principles for which our ancestors so gloriously contended As far as it depends upon me it shall be accomplished. All the influence that I possess shall be exerted to prevent the formation at least of an Executive party in the halls of the legislative body. I wish for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not satisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds his appointment nor any confence in advance from the people but that asked for by Mr. Jefferson to give firmness and effect to the legal administration of their affairs. < I deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify me in expressing to my fellowcitizens a profound reverence for the Christian religion and a thorough conviction that sound morals religious liberty and a just sense of religious responsibility are essentially connected with all true and lasting happiness; and to that good Being who has blessed us by the gifts of civil and religious freedom who watched over and prospered the labors of our fathers and has hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence those of any other people let us unite in fervently commending every interest of our beloved country in all future time. < Fellowcitizens being fully invested with that high office to which the partiality of my countrymen has called me I now take an affectionate leave of you. You will bear with you to your homes the remembrance of the pledge I have this day given to discharge all the high duties of my exalted station according to the best of my ability and I shall enter upon their performance with entire confence in the support of a just and generous people. 
To the Senate of the United States:< I herewith transmit to the Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification a convention between the United States and Great Britain concluded at Washington on the 19th instant by John M. Clayton Secretary of State on the part of the United States and by the Right Hon. Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer on the part of Great Britain.< This treaty has been negotiated in accordance with the general s expressed in my message to Congress in December last. Its object is to establish a commercial alliance with all great maritime states for the protection of a cond ship canal through the territory of Nicaragua to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and at the same time to insure the same protection to the cond railways or canals by the Tehuantepec and Panama routes as well as to every other interoceanic communication which may be adopted to shorten the transit to or from our territories on the Pacific.< It will be seen that this treaty does not propose to take money from the public Treasury to effect any object cond by it. It yields protection to the capitalists who may undertake to construct any canal or railway across the Isthmus commencing in the southern part of Mexico and terminating in the territory of New Granada. It gives no preference to any one route over another but proposes the same measure of protection for all which ingenuity and enterprise can construct. Should this treaty be ratified it will secure in future the liberation of all Central America from any kind of foreign aggression.< At the time negotiations were opened with Nicaragua for the construction of a canal through her territory I found Great Britain in possession of nearly half of Central America as the ally and protector of the Mosquito King. It has been my object in negotiating this treaty not only to secure the passage across the Isthmus to the Government and citizens of the United States by the construction of a great highway dedicated to the use of all nations on equal terms but to maintain the independence and sovereignty of all the Central American Republics. The Senate will judge how far these objects have been effected.< If there be any who would desire to seize and annex any portion of the territories of these weak sister republics to the American Union or to extend our dominion over them I do not concur in their policy; and I wish it to be understood in reference to that subject that I adopt the s entertained so far as I know by all my predecessors.< The principles by which I have been regulated in the negotiation of this treaty are in accordance with the sentiments well expressed by my immediate predecessor on the 10th of February 1847 when he communicated to the Senate the treaty with New Granada for the protection of the railroad at panama. It is in accordance with the whole spirit of the resolution of the Senate of the 3d of March 1835 referred to by Present Polk and with the policy adopted by Present Jackson immediately after the passage of that resolution who dispatched an agent to Central America and New Granada to open negotiations with those Governments for the purpose of effectually protecting by suitable treaty stipulations with them such inuals or companies as might undertake to open a communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the construction of a ship canal across the isthmus which connects North and South America and of securing forever by such stipulations the free and equal right of igating such canal to all such nations on the payment of such reasonable tolls as might be established to compensate the capitalists who should engage in such undertaking and complete the work.< I also communicate herewith a copy of the correspondence between the American Secretary of State and the British plenipotentiary at the time of concluding the treaty. Whatever honor may be due to the party first proposing such a treaty justly belongs to the United States. My predecessor in his message of the 10th of February 1847 referring to the treaty with New Granada for the protection of the Panama Railroad observes that< Should the proposition thus tendered be rejected we may deprive the United States of the just influence which its acceptance might secure to them and confer the glory and benefits of being the first among the nations in concluding such an arrangement upon the Government either of Great Britain or France. That either of these Governments would embrace the offer can not be doubted because there does not appear to be any other effectual means of securing to all nations the advantages of this important passage but the guaranty of great commercial powers that the Isthmus shall be neutral territory. The interests of the world at stake are so important that the security of this passage between the two oceans can not be suffered to depend upon the wars and revolutions which may arise among different nations.< Should the Senate in its wisdom see fit to confirm this treaty and the treaty heretofore submitted by me for their advice in regard to its ratification negotiated with the State of Nicaragua on the 3d day of September last it will be necessary to amend one or both of them so that both treaties may stand in conformity with each other in their spirit and intention. The Senate will discover by examining them both that this is a task of no great difficulty.< I have good reason to believe that France and Russia stand ready to accede to this treaty and that no other great maritime state will refuse its accession to an arrangement so well calculated to diffuse the blessings of peace commerce and civilization and so honorable to all nations which may enter into the engagement.< 
To the Senate of the United States:< I have received the resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant requesting me to lay before that body if not incompatible with the public interest any information I may possess in regard to an alleged recent case of a forcible resistance to the execution of the laws of the United States in the city of Boston and to communicate to the Senate under the above conditions what means I have adopted to meet the occurrence and whether in my opinion any additional legislation is necessary to meet the exigency of the case and to more vigorously execute existing laws.< The public newspapers contain an affavit of Patrick Riley a deputy marshal for the district of Massachusetts setting forth the circumstances of the case a copy of which affavit is herewith communicated. Private and unofficial communications concur in establishing the main facts of this account but no satisfactory official information has as yet been received; and in some important respects the accuracy of the account has been denied by persons whom it implicates. Nothing could be more unexpected than that such a gross violation of law such a highhanded contempt of the authority of the United States should be perpetrated by a band of lawless confederates at noonday in the city of Boston and in the very temple of justice. I regard this flagitious proceeding as being a surprise not unattended by some degree of negligence; nor do I doubt that if any such act of violence had been apprehended thousands of the good citizens of Boston would have presented themselves voluntarily and promptly to prevent it. But the danger does not seem to have been timely made known or duly appreciated by those who were concerned in the execution of the process. In a community distinguished for its love of order and respect for the laws among a people whose sentiment is liberty and law and not liberty without law nor above the law such an outrage could only be the result of sudden violence unhappily too much unprepared for to be successfully resisted. It would be melancholy indeed if we were obliged to regard this outbreak against the constitutional and legal authority of the Government as proceeding from the general feeling of the people in a spot which is proverbially called the Cradle of American Liberty. Such undoubtedly is not the fact. It violates without question the general sentiment of the people of Boston and of a vast majority of the whole people of Massachusetts as much as it violates the law defies the authority of the Government and disgraces those concerned in it their alders and abettors.< It is nevertheless my duty to lay before the Senate in answer to its resolution some important facts and conserations connected with the subject.< A resolution of Congress of September 23 1789 declared:< That it be recommended to the legislatures of the several States to pass laws making it expressly the duty of the keepers of their jails to receive and safe keep therein all prisoners committed under the authority of the United States until they shall be discharged by the course of the laws thereof under the like penalties as in the case of prisoners committed under the authority of such States respectively; the United States to pay for the use and keeping of such jails at the rate of 50 cents per month for each prisoner that shall under their authority be committed thereto during the time such prisoner shall be therein confined and also to support such of sa prisoners as shall be committed for offenses.< A further resolution of Congress of the 3d of March 1791 proves that< Whereas Congress d by a resolution of the 23d day of September 1789 recommend to the several States to pass laws making it expressly the duty of the keepers of their jails to receive and safe keep therein all prisoners committed under the authority of the United States: In order therefore to insure the administration of justice< Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled  That in case any State shall not have complied with the sa recommendation the marshal in such State under the direction of the judge of the district be authorized to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail and to make the necessary provision for the safekeeping of prisoners committed under the authority of the United States until permanent provision shall be made by law for that purpose; and the sa marshal shall be allowed his reasonable expenses incurred for the above purposes to be pa out of the Treasury of the United States.< And a resolution of Congress of March 3 1821 proves that< Where any State or States having complied with the recommendation of Congress in the resolution of the 23d day of September 1789 shall have withdrawn or shall hereafter withdraw either in whole or in part the use of their jails for prisoners committed under the authority of the United States the marshal in such State or States under the direction of the judge of the district shall be and hereby is authorized and required to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail and to make the necessary provision for the safekeeping of prisoners committed under the authority of the United States until permanent provision shall be made by law for that purpose; and the sa marshal shall be allowed his reasonable expenses incurred for the above purposes to be pa out of the Treasury of the United States.< These various provisions of the law remain unrepealed.< By the law of Massachusetts as that law stood before the act of the legislature of that State of the 24th of March 1843 the common jails in the respective counties were to be used for the detention of any persons detained or committed by the authority of the courts of the United States as well as by the courts and magistrates of the State. But these provisions were abrogated and repealed by the act of the legislature of Massachusetts of the 24th of March 1843.< That act declares that< No judge of any court of record of this Commonwealth and no justice of the peace shall hereafter take cognizance or grant a certificate in cases that may arise under the third section of an act of Congress passed February 12 1793 and entitled An act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters to any person who claims any other person as a fugitive slave within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.< And it further declares that< No sheriff deputy sheriff coroner constable jailer or other officer of this Commonwealth shall hereafter arrest or detain or a in the arrest or detention or imprisonment in any jail or other building belonging to this Commonwealth or to any county city or town thereof of any person for the reason that he is claimed as a fugitive slave.< And it further declares that< Any justice of the peace sheriff deputy sheriff coroner constable or jailer who shall offend against the provisions of this law by in any way acting directly or indirectly under the power conferred by the third section of the act of Congress aforementioned shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $1000 for every such offense to the use of the county where sa offense is committed or shall be subject to imprisonment not exceeding one year in the county jail.< This law it is obvious had two objects. The first was to make it a penal offense in all officers and magistrates of the Commonwealth to exercise the powers conferred on them by the act of Congress of the 12th of February 1793 entitled An act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters and which powers they were fully competent to perform up to the time of this inhibition and penal enactment; second to refuse the use of the jails of the State for the detention of any person claimed as a fugitive slave.< It is deeply to be lamented that the purpose of these enactments is quite apparent. It was to prevent as far as the legislature of the State could prevent the laws of Congress passed for the purpose of carrying into effect that article of the Constitution of the United States which declares that no person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due from being carried into effect. But these acts of State legislation although they may cause embarrassment and create expense can not derogate either from the duty or the authority of Congress to carry out fully and fairly the plain and imperative constitutional provision for the delivery of persons bound to labor in one State and escaping into another to the party to whom such labor may be due. It is quite clear that by the resolution of Congress of March 3 1821 the marshal of the United States in any State in which the use of the jails of the State has been withdrawn in whole or in part from the purpose of the detention of persons committed under the authority of the United States is not only empowered but expressly required under the direction of the judge of the district to hire a convenient place for the safekeeping of prisoners committed under authority of the United States. It will be seen from papers accompanying this communication that the attention of the marshal of Massachusetts was distinctly called to this provision of the law by a letter from the Secretary of the Navy of the date of October 28 last. There is no official information that the marshal has proved any such place for the confinement of his prisoners. If he has not it is to be regretted that this power was not exercised by the marshal under the direction of the district judge immediately on the passage of the act of the legislature of Massachusetts of the 24th of March 1843 and especially that it was not exercised on the passage of the fugitiveslave law of the last session or when the attention of the marshal was afterwards particularly drawn to it.< It is true that the escape from the deputy marshals in this case was not owing to the want of a prison or place of confinement but still it is not easy to see how the prisoner could have been safely and conveniently detained during an adjournment of the hearing for some days without such place of confinement. If it shall appear that no such place has been obtained directions to the marshal will be given to lose no time in the discharge of this duty.< I transmit to the Senate the copy of a proclamation issued by me on the 18th instant in relation to these unexpected and deplorable occurrences in Boston together with copies of instructions from the Departments of War and Navy relative to the general subject. And I communicate also copies of telegraphic dispatches transmitted from the Department of State to the district attorney and marshal of the United States for the district of Massachusetts and their answers thereto.< In regard to the last branch of the inquiry made by the resolution of the Senate I have to observe that the Constitution declares that the Present shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed and that he shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and of the militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States and that Congress shall have power to prove for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union suppress insurrections and repel invasions. From which it appears that the Army and Navy are by the Constitution placed under the control of the Executive; and probably no legislation of Congress could add to or diminish the power thus given but by increasing or diminishing or abolishing altogether the Army and Navy. But not so with the militia. The Present can not call the militia into service even to execute the laws or repel invasions but by the authority of acts of Congress passed for that purpose. But when the militia are called into service in the manner prescribed by law then the Constitution itself gives the command to the Present. Acting on this principle Congress by the act of February 28 1795 authorized the Present to call forth the militia to repel invasion and suppress insurrections against a State government and to suppress combinations against the laws of the United States and cause the laws to be faithfully executed. But the act proceeds to declare that whenever it may be necessary in the judgment of the Present to use the military force thereby directed to be called forth the Present shall forthwith by proclamation command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time. These words are broad enough to require a proclamation in all cases where militia are called out under that act whether to repel invasion or suppress an insurrection or to a in executing the laws. This section has consequently created some doubt whether the militia could be called forth to a in executing the laws without a previous proclamation. But yet the proclamation seems to be in words directed only against insurgents and to require them to disperse thereby implying not only an insurrection but an organized or at least an embodied force. Such a proclamation in a of the civil authority would often defeat the whole object by giving such notice to persons intended to be arrested that they would be enabled to fly or secrete themselves. The force may be wanted sometimes to make the arrest and also sometimes to protect the officer after it is made and to prevent a rescue. I would therefore suggest that this section be modified by declaring that nothing therein contained shall be construed to require any previous proclamation when the militia are called forth either to repel invasion to execute the laws or suppress combinations against them and that the Present may make such call and place such militia under the control of any civil officer of the United States to a him in executing the laws or suppressing such combinations; and while so employed they shall be pa by and subsisted at the expense of the United States.< Congress not probably adverting to the difference between the militia and the Regular Army by the act of March 3 1807 authorized the Present to use the land and al forces of the United States for the same purposes for which he might call forth the militia and subject to the same proclamation. But the power of the Present under the Constitution as Commander of the Army and Navy is general and his duty to see the laws faithfully executed is general and positive; and the act of 1807 ought not to be construed as evincing any disposition in Congress to limit or restrain this constitutional authority. For greater certainty however it may be well that Congress should modify or explain this act in regard to its provisions for the employment of the Army and Navy of the United States as well as that in regard to calling forth the militia. It is supposed not to be doubtful that all citizens whether enrolled in the militia or not may be summoned as members of the posse comitatus either by the marshal or a commissioner according to law and that it is their duty to obey such summons. But perhaps it may be doubted whether the marshal or a commissioner can summon as the posse comitatus an organized militia force acting under its own appropriate officers without the consent of such officers. This point may deserve the conseration of Congress.< I use this occasion to repeat the assurance that so far as depends on me the laws shall be faithfully executed and all forcible opposition to them suppressed; and to this end I am prepared to exercise whenever it may become necessary the power constitutionally vested in me to the fullest extent. I am fully persuaded that the great majority of the people of this country are warmly and strongly attached to the Constitution the preservation of the Union the just support of the Government and the maintenance of the authority of law. I am persuaded that their earnest wishes and the line of my constitutional duty entirely concur and I doubt not firmness moderation and prudence strengthened and animated by the general opinion of the people will prevent the repetition of occurrences disturbing the public peace and reprobated by all good men.< April 25 1851 Warning Against Participating in Unlawful Invasions of Cuba< Whereas there is reason to believe that a military expedition is about to be fitted out in the United States with intention to invade the island of Cuba a colony of Spain with which this country is at peace; and< Whereas it is believed that this expedition is instigated and set on foot chiefly by foreigners who dare to make our shores the scene of their guilty and hostile preparations against a friendly power and seek by falsehood and misrepresentation to seduce our own citizens especially the young and inconserate into their wicked schemesan ungrateful return for the benefits conferred upon them by this people in permitting them to make our country an asylum from oppression and in flagrant abuse of the hospitality thus extended to them; and< Whereas such expeditions can only be regarded as adventures for plunder and robbery and must meet the condemnation of the civilized world whilst they are derogatory to the character of our country in violation of the laws of nations and expressly prohibited by our own. Our statutes declare that if any person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States begin or set on foot or prove or prepare the means for any military expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state or of any colony district or people with whom the United States are at peace every person so offending shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor and shall be fined not exceeding $3000 and imprisoned not more than three years:< Now therefore I have issued this my proclamation warning all persons who shall connect themselves with any such enterprise or expedition in violation of our laws and national obligations that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against such offenses and will forfeit their claim to the protection of this Government or any interference on their behalf no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence of their illegal conduct. And therefore I exhort all good citizens as they regard our national reputation as they respect their own laws and the laws of nations as they value the blessings of peace and the welfare of their country to discountenance and by all lawful means prevent any such enterprise; and I call upon every officer of this Government civil or military to use all efforts in his power to arrest for trial and punishment every such offender against the laws of the country.< Given under my hand the 25th day of April A. D. 1851 and the seventyfifth of the Independence of the United States.< 
To the House of Representatives of the United States:< It is with unfeigned regret that I find myself under the necessity of returning to the House of Representatives with my objections a bill entitled An act to prove revenue from imports and to change and modify existing laws imposing duties on imports and for other purposes. Nothing can be more painful to any inual called upon to perform the Chief Executive duties under our limited Constitution than to be constrained to withhold his assent from an important measure adopted by the Legislature. Yet he would neither fulfill the high purposes of his station nor consult the true interests or the solemn will of the peoplethe common constituents of both branches of the Governmentby yielding his wellconsered most deeply fixed and repeatedly declared opinions on matters of great public concernment to those of a coordinate department without requesting that department seriously to reexamine the subject of their difference. The exercise of some independence of judgment in regard to all acts of legislation is plainly implied in the responsibility of approving them. At all times a duty it becomes a peculiarly solemn and imperative one when the subjects passed upon by Congress happen to involve as in the present instance the most momentous issues to affect variously the various parts of a great country and to have given rise in all quarters to such a conflict of opinion as to render it impossible to conjecture with any certainty on which se the majority really is. Surely if the pause for reflection intended by the wise authors of the Constitution by referring the subject back to Congress for reconseration be ever expedient and necessary it is precisely such a case as the present.< On the subject of distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands in the existing state of the finances it has been my duty to make known my settled convictions on various occasions during the present session of Congress. At the opening of the extra session upward of twelve months ago sharing fully in the general hope of returning prosperity and credit I recommended such a distribution but that recommendation was even then expressly coupled with the condition that the duties on imports should not exceed the rate of 20 per cent proved by the compromise act of 1833. These hopes were not a little encouraged and these s strengthened by the report of Mr. Ewing then Secretary of the Treasury which was shortly thereafter la before Congress in which he recommended the imposition of duties at the rate of 20 per cent ad valorem on all free articles with specified exceptions and stated if this measure be adopted there will be received in the Treasury from customs in the last quarter of the present year $5300000; in all of the year 1842 about $22500000; and in the year 1843 after the final reduction under the act of March 2 1833 about $20800000; and adds:< It is believed that after the heavy expenditures required by the public service in the present year shall have been proved for the revenues which will accrue from that or a nearly approximate rate of duty will be sufficient to defray the expenses of the Government and leave a surplus to be annually applied to the gradual payment of the national debt leaving the proceeds of the public lands to be disposed of as Congress shall see fit.< I was most happy that Congress at the time seemed entirely to concur in the recommendations of the Executive and anticipating the correctness of the Secretary's conclusions and in  of an actual surplus passed the distribution act of the 4th September last wisely limiting its operation by two conditions having reference both of them to a possible state of the Treasury different from that which had been anticipated by the Secretary of the Treasury and to the paramount necessities of the public service. It ordained that if at any time during the existence of that act there should be an imposition of duties on imports inconsistent with the provision of the act of the 2d March 1833 and beyond the rate of duties fixed by that act to wit 20 per cent on the value of such imports or any of them then the distribution should be suspended and should continue so suspended until that cause should be removed. By a previous clause it had in a like spirit of wise and cautious patriotism proved for another case in which all are even now agreed that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should be used for the defense of the country. It was enacted that the act should continue and be in force until otherwise proved by law unless the United States should become involved in war with any foreign power in which event from the commencement of hostilities the act should be suspended until the cessation of hostilities.< Not long after the opening of the present session of Congress the unprecedented and extraordinary difficulties that have recently embarrassed the finances of the country began to assume a serious aspect. It soon became quite event that the hopes under which the act of 4th September was passed and which alone justified it in the eyes either of Congress who imposed or of the Executive who approved the first of the two conditions just recited were not destined to be fulfilled. Under the pressure therefore of the embarrassments which had thus unexpectedly arisen it appeared to me that the course to be pursued had been clearly marked out for the Government by that act itself. The condition cond in it as requiring a suspension of its operation had occurred. It became necessary in the opinions of all to raise the rate of duties upon imports above 20 per cent; and with a  both to prove available means to meet present exigencies and to lay the foundation for a successful negotiation of a loan I felt it incumbent on me to urge upon Congress to raise the duties accordingly imposing them in a spirit of a wise discrimination for the twofold object of affording ample revenue for the Government and incental protection to the various branches of domestic industry. I also pressed in the most emphatic but respectful language I could employ the necessity of making the land sales available to the Treasury as the basis of public credit. I d not think that I could stand excused much less justified before the people of the United States nor could I reconcile it to myself to recommend the imposition of additional taxes upon them without at the same time urging the employment of all the legitimate means of the Government toward satisfying its wants. These opinions were communicated in advance of any definitive action of Congress on the subject either of the tariff or land sales under a high sense of public duty and in compliance with an express injunction of the Constitution so that if a collision extremely to be deprecated as such collisions always are has seemingly arisen between the executive and legislative branches of the Government it has assuredly not been owing to any capricious interference or to any want of a plain and frank declaration of opinion on the part of the former. Congress differed in its s with those of the Executive as it had undoubtedly a right to do and passed a bill virtually for a time repealing the proviso of the act of the 4th September 1841. The bill was returned to the House in which it originated with my objections to its becoming a law. With a  to prevent if possible an open disagreement of opinion on a point so important I took occasion to declare that I regarded it as an indispensable prerequisite to an increase of duties above 20 per cent that the act of the 4th September should remain unrepealed in its provisions. My reasons for that opinion were elaborately set forth in the message which accompanied the return of the bill which no constitutional majority appears to have been found for passing into a law.< The bill which is now before me proposes in its twentyseventh section the total repeal of one of the provisos in the act of September and while it increases the duties above 20 per cent directs an unconditional distribution of the land proceeds. I am therefore subjected a second time in the period of a few days to the necessity of either giving my approval to a measure which in my deliberate judgment is in conflict with great public interests or of returning it to the House in which it originated with my objections. With all my anxiety for the passage of a law which would replenish an exhausted Treasury and furnish a sound and healthy encouragement to mechanical industry I can not consent to do so at the sacrifice of the peace and harmony of the country and the clearest convictions of public duty.< For some of the reasons which have brought me to this conclusion I refer to my previous messages to Congress and briefly subjoin the following:< 1. The bill unites two subjects which so far from having any affinity to one another are wholly incongruous in their character. It is both a revenue and an appropriation bill. It thus imposes on the Executive in the first place the necessity of either approving that which he would reject or rejecting that which he might otherwise approve. This is a species of constraint to which the judgment of the Executive ought not in my opinion to be subjected. But that is not my only objection to the act in its present form. The union of subjects wholly dissimilar in their character in the same bill if it grew into a practice would not fail to lead to consequences destructive of all wise and conscientious legislation. Various measures each agreeable only to a small minority might by being thus unitedand the more the greater chance of successlead to the passing of laws of which no single provision could if standing alone command a majority in its favor.< 2. While the Treasury is in a state of extreme embarrassment requiring every dollar which it can make available and when the Government has not only to lay additional taxes but to borrow money to meet pressing demands the bill proposes to give away a fruitful source of revenuewhich is the same thing as raising money by loan and taxationnot to meet the wants of the Government but for distributiona proceeding which I must regard as highly impolitic if not unconstitutional.< A brief re of the present condition of the public finances will serve to illustrate the true condition of the Treasury and exhibit its actual necessities:< On the 5th of August (Fray last) there was in the< Treasury in round numbers $2150000< Necessary to be retained to meet trust funds  $360000< Interest on public debt due in October 80000< To redeem Treasury notes and pay the interest 100000< Land distribution under the act of the 4th of September 1841 640000< 1180000< Leaving an available amount of 970000< The Navy Department had drawn requisitions on the Treasury at that time to meet debts actually due among which are bills under protest for 1414000 thus leaving an actual deficit of $444000.< There was on hand about $100000 of unissued Treasury notes assisted by the accruing revenue (amounting to about $150000 per week exclusive of receipts on unpa bonds) to meet requisitions for the Army and the demands of the civil list.< The withdrawal of the sum of $640000 to be distributed among the States so soon as the statements and accounts can be made up and completed by virtue of the provisions of the act of the 4th of September last (of which nearly a moiety goes to a few States and only about $383000 is to be ed among all the States) while it adds materially to the embarrassments of the Treasury affords to the States no deced relief.< No immediate relief from this state of things is anticipated unless (what would most deeply be deplored) the Government could be reconciled to the negotiation of loans already authorized by law at a rate of discount ruinous in itself and calculated most seriously to affect the public credit. So great is the depression of trade that even if the present bill were to become a law and prove to be productive some time would elapse before sufficient supplies would flow into the Treasury while in the meantime its embarrassments would be continually augmented by the semiannual distribution of the land proceeds.< Indeed there is but too much ground to apprehend that even if this bill were permitted to become a lawalienating as it does the proceeds of the land salesan actual deficit in the Treasury would occur which would more than probably involve the necessity of a resort to direct taxation.< Let it be also remarked that $5500000 of the public debt becomes redeemable in about two years and a half which at any sacrifice must be met while the Treasury is always liable to demands for the payment of outstanding Treasury notes. Such is the gloomy picture which our financial department now presents and which calls for the exercise of a rig economy in the public expenditures and the rendering available of all the means within the control of the Government. I most respectfully submit whether this is a time to give away the proceeds of the land sales when the public lands constitute a fund which of all others may be made most useful in sustaining the public credit. Can the Government be generous and munificent to others when every dollar it can command is necessary to supply its own wants? And if Congress would not hesitate to suffer the provisions of the act of 4th September last to remain unrepealed in case the country was involved in war is not the necessity for such a course now just as imperative as it would be then?< 3. A third objection remains to be urged which would be sufficient in itself to induce me to return the bill to the House with my objections. By uniting two subjects so incongruous as tariff and distribution it inevitably makes the fate of the one dependent upon that of the other in future contests of party. Can anything be more fatal to the merchant or manufacturer than such an alliance? What they most of all require is a system of moderate duties so arranged as to withdraw the tariff question as far as possible completely from the arena of political contention. Their chief want is permanency and stability. Such an increase of the tariff I believe to be necessary in order to meet the economical expenditures of Government. Such an increase made in the spirit of moderation and judicious discrimination would I have no doubt be entirely satisfactory to the great majority of the American people. In the way of accomplishing a measure so salutary and so imperatively demanded by every public interest the legislative department will meet with a cordial cooperation on the part of the Executive. This is all that the manufacturer can desire and it would be a burden readily borne by the people. But I can not too earnestly repeat that in order to be beneficial it must be permanent and in order to be permanent it must command general acquiescence. But can such permanency be justly hoped for if the tariff question be coupled with that of distribution as to which a serious conflict of opinion exists among the States and the people and which enlists in its support a bare majority if indeed there be a majority of the two Houses of Congress? What permanency or stability can attach to a measure which warring upon itself gives away a fruitful source of revenue at the moment it proposes a large increase of taxes on the people? Is the manufacturer prepared to stake himself and his interests upon such an issue?< I know that it is urged (but most erroneously in my opinion) that instability is just as apt to be produced by retaining the public lands as a source of revenue as from any other cause and this is ascribed to a constant fluctuation as it is sa in the amount of sales. If there were anything in this objection it equally applies to every imposition of duties on imports. The amount of revenue annually derived from duties is constantly liable to change. The regulations of foreign governments the varying productiveness of other countries periods of excitement in trade and a great variety of other circumstances are constantly arising to affect the state of commerce foreign and domestic and of consequence the revenue levied upon it. The sales of the public domain in ordinary times are regulated by fixed laws which have their basis in a demand increasing only in the ratio of the increase of population. In recurring to the statistics connected with this subject it will be perceived that for a period of ten years preceding 1834 the average amount of land sales d not exceed $2000000. For the increase which took place in 1834 1835 and 1836 we are to look to that peculiar condition of the country which grew out of one of the most extraordinary excitements in business and speculation that has ever occurred in the history of commerce and currency. It was the fruit of a wild spirit of adventure engendered by a vicious system of credits under the evils of which the country is still laboring and which it is fondly hoped will not soon recur. Consering the vast amount of investments made by private inuals in the public lands during those three years and which equaled $43000000 (equal to more than twenty years' purchase) taking the average of sales of the ten preceding years it may be safely asserted that the result of the publicland sales can hold out nothing to alarm the manufacturer with the ea of instability in the revenues and consequently in the course of the Government.< Under what appears to me therefore the soundest conserations of public policy and in  of the interests of every branch of domestic industry I return you the bill with these my objections to its becoming a law.< I take occasion emphatically to repeat my anxious desire to cooperate with Congress in the passing of a law which while it shall assist in supplying the wants of the Treasury and reestablish public credit shall afford to the manufacturing interests of the country all the incental protection they require.< After all the effect of what I do is substantially to call on Congress to reconser the subject. If on such reconseration a majority of twothirds of both Houses should be in favor of this measure it will become a law notwithstanding my objections. In a case of clear and manifest error on the part of the Present the presumption of the Constitution is that such majorities will be found. Should they be so found in this case having conscientiously discharged my own duty I shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result.<
