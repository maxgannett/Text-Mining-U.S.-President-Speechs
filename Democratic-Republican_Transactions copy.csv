Whereas the Congress of the United States by a joint resolution of the two Houses have signified a request that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity as a day of public humiliation and prayer; andWhereas in times of public calamity such as that of the war brought on the United States by the injustice of a foreign government it is especially becoming that the hearts of all should be touched with the same and the eyes of all be turned to that Almighty Power in whose hand are the welfare and the destiny of nations:I do therefore issue this my proclamation recommending to all who shall be piously disposed to unite their hearts and voices in addressing at one and the same time their vows and adorations to the Great Parent and Sovereign of the Universe that they assemble on the second Thursday of September next in their respective religious congregations to render Him thanks for the many blessings has bestowed on the people of the United States; that has blessed them with a land capable of yielding all the necessaries and requisites of human life with ample means for convenient exchanges with foreign countries; that has blessed the labors employed in its cultivation and improvement; that is now blessing the exertions to extend and establish the arts and manufactures which will secure within ourselves supplies too important to remain dependent on the precarious policy or the peaceable dispositions of other nations and particularly that has blessed the United States with a political Constitution rounded on the will and authority of the whole people and guaranteeing to each inual security not only of his person and his property but of those sacred rights of conscience so essential to his present happiness and so dear to his future hopes; that with those expressions of devout thankfulness be joined supplications to the same Almighty Power that would look down with compassion on our infirmities; that would pardon our manifold transgressions and awaken and strengthen in all the wholesome purposes of repentance and amendment; that in this season of trial and calamity would prese in a particular manner over our public councils and inspire all citizens with a love of their country and with those fraternal affections and that mutual confence which have so happy a tendency to make us safe at home and respected abroad; and that as was graciously pleased heretofore to smile on our struggles against the attempts of the Government of the Empire of which these States then made a part to wrest from them the rights and privileges to which they were entitled in common with every other part and to raise them to the station of an independent and sovereign people so would now be pleased in like manner to bestow His blessing on our arms in resisting the hostile and persevering efforts of the same power to degrade us on the ocean the common inheritance of all from rights and immunities belonging and essential to the American people as a coequal member of the great community of independent nations; and that inspiring our enemies with moderation with justice and with that spirit of reasonable accommodation which our country has continued to manifest we may be enabled to beat our swords into plowshares and to enjoy in peace every man the fruits of his honest industry and the rewards of his lawful enterprise.If the public homage of a people can ever be worthy the favorable regard of the Holy and Omniscient Being to whom it is addressed it must be that in which those who join in it are gued only by their free choice by the impulse of their hearts and the dictates of their consciences; and such a spectacle must be interesting to all Christian nations as proving that religion that gift of Heaven for the good of man freed from all coercive edicts from that unhallowed connection with the powers of this world which corrupts religion into an instrument or an usurper of the policy of the state and making no appeal but to reason to the heart and to the conscience can spread its benign influence everywhere and can attract to the ine altar those freewill offerings of humble supplication thanksgiving and praise which alone can be acceptable to Him whom no hypocrisy can deceive and no forced sacrifices propitiate.Upon these principles and with these s the good people of the United States are invited in conformity with the resolution aforesa to dedicate the day above named to the religious solemnities therein recommended.Given at Washington this 23d day of July A. D. 1813.JAMES MADISON.
To the House of Representatives of the United States: Having consered the bill this day presented to me entitled An act to set apart and pledge certain funds for internal improvements and which sets apart and pledges funds for constructing roads and canals and improving the igation of water courses in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several States and to render more easy and less expensive the means and provisions for the common defense I am constrained by the insuperable difficulty I feel in reconciling the bill with the Constitution of the United States to return it with that objection to the House of Representatives in which it originated.The legislative powers vested in Congress are specified and enumerated in the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution and it does not appear that the power proposed to be exercised by the bill is among the enumerated powers or that it falls by any just interpretation within the power to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution those or other powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States.The power to regulate commerce among the several States can not include a power to construct roads and canals and to improve the igation of water courses in order to facilitate promote and secure such a commerce without a latitude of construction departing from the ordinary import of the terms strengthened by the known inconveniences which doubtless led to the grant of this remedial power to Congress.To refer the power in question to the clause to prove for the common defense and general welfare would be contrary to the established and consistent rules of interpretation as rendering the special and careful enumeration of powers which follow the clause nugatory and improper. Such a  of the Constitution would have the effect of giving to Congress a general power of legislation instead of the defined and limited one hitherto understood to belong to them the terms common defense and general welfare embracing every object and act within the pur of a legislative trust. It would have the effect of subjecting both the Constitution and laws of the several States in all cases not specifically exempted to be superseded by laws of Congress it being expressly declared that the Constitution of the United States and laws made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges of every State shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. Such a  of the Constitution finally would have the effect of excluding the judicial authority of the United States from its participation in guarding the boundary between the legislative powers of the General and the State Governments inasmuch as questions relating to the general welfare being questions of policy and expediency are unsusceptible of judicial cognizance and decision.A restriction of the power to prove for the common defense and general welfare to cases which are to be proved for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of Congress all the great and most important measures of Government money being the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into execution.If a general power to construct roads and canals and to improve the igation of water courses with the train of powers incent thereto be not possessed by Congress the assent of the States in the mode proved in the bill can not confer the power. The only cases in which the consent and cession of particular States can extend the power of Congress are those specified and proved for in the Constitution.I am not unaware of the great importance of roads and canals and the improved igation of water courses and that a power in the National Legislature to prove for them might be exercised with signal advantage to the general prosperity. But seeing that such a power is not expressly given by the Constitution and believing that it can not be deduced from any part of it without an inadmissible latitude of construction and a reliance on insufficient precedents; believing also that the permanent success of the Constitution depends on a definite partition of powers between the General and the State Governments and that no adequate landmarks would be left by the constructive extension of the powers of Congress as proposed in the bill I have no option but to withhold my signature from it and to cherishing the hope that its beneficial objects may be attained by a resort for the necessary powers to the same wisdom and virtue in the nation which established the Constitution in its actual form and provently marked out in the instrument itself a safe and practicable mode of improving it as experience might suggest.JAMES MADISON.
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:I communicate to Congress certain documents being a continuation of those heretofore la before them on the subject of our affairs with Great Britain.Without going back beyond the renewal in 1803 of the war in which Great Britain is engaged and omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferior magnitude the conduct of her government presents a series of acts hostile to the United States as an independent and neutral nation.British cruisers have been in the continued practice of violating the American flag on the great highway of nations and of seizing and carrying off persons sailing under it not in the exercise of a belligerent right founded on the law of nations against an enemy but of a municipal prerogative over British subjects. British jurisdiction is thus extended to neutral vessels in a situation where no laws can operate but the law of nations and the laws of the country to which the vessels belong and a selfredress is assumed which if British subjects were wrongfully detained and alone concerned is that substitution of force for a resort to the responsible sovereign which falls within the definition of war. Could the seizure of British subjects in such cases be regarded as within the exercise of a belligerent right the acknowledged laws of war which forb an article of captured property to be adjudged without a regular investigation before a competent tribunal would imperiously demand the fairest trial where the sacred rights of persons were at issue. In place of such a trial these rights are subjected to the will of every petty commander.The practice hence is so far from affecting British subjects alone that under the pretext of searching for these thousands of American citizens under the safeguard of public law and of their national flag have been torn from their country and from everything dear to them; have been dragged on board ships of war of a foreign nation and exposed under the severities of their discipline to be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes to risk their lives in the battles of their oppressors and to be the melancholy instruments of taking away those of their own brethren.Against this crying enormity which Great Britain would be so prompt to avenge if committed against herself the United States have in vain exhausted remonstrances and expostulations and that no proof might be wanting of their conciliatory dispositions and no pretext left for a continuance of the practice the British government was formally assured of the readiness of the United States to enter into arrangements such as could not be rejected if the recovery of British subjects were the real and the sole object. The communication passed without effect.British cruisers have been in the practice also of violating the rights and the peace of our coasts. They hover over and harass our entering and departing commerce. To the most insulting pretensions they have added the most lawless proceedings in our very harbors and have wantonly spilt American blood within the sanctuary of our territorial jurisdiction. The principles and rules enforced by that nation when a neutral nation against armed vessels of belligerents hovering near her coasts and disturbing her commerce are well known. When called on nevertheless by the United States to punish the greater offenses committed by her own vessels her government has bestowed on their commanders additional marks of honor and confence.Under pretended ades without the presence of an adequate force and sometimes without the practicability of applying one our commerce has been plundered in every sea the great staples of our country have been cut off from their legitimate markets and a destructive blow aimed at our agricultural and maritime interests. In aggravation of these predatory measures they have been consered as in force from the dates of their notification a retrospective effect being thus added as has been done in other important cases to the unlawfulness of the course pursued. And to render the outrage the more signal these mock ades have been reiterated and enforced in the face of official communications from the British government declaring as the true definition of a legal ade that particular ports must be actually invested and previous warning given to vessels bound to them not to enter.Not content with these occasional expedients for laying waste our neutral trade the cabinet of Britain resorted at length to the sweeping system of ades under the name of orders in council which has been molded and managed as might best suit its political s its commercial jealousies or the avity of British cruisers.To our remonstrances against the complicated and transcendent injustice of this innovation the first reply was that the orders were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain as a necessary retaliation on decrees of her enemy proclaiming a general ade of the British Isles at a time when the al force of that enemy dared not issue from his own ports. She was reminded without effect that her own prior ades unsupported by an adequate al force actually applied and continued were a bar to this plea; that executed edicts against millions of our property could not be retaliation on edicts confessedly impossible to be executed; that retaliation to be just should fall on the party setting the guilty example not on an innocent party which was not even chargeable with an acquiescence in it.When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our trade with her enemy by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with Great Britain her cabinet instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical discontinuance of its orders formally avowed a determination to persist in them against the United States until the markets of her enemy should be la open to British products thus asserting an obligation on a neutral power to require one belligerent to encourage by its internal regulations the trade of another belligerent contradicting her own practice toward all nations in peace as well as in war and betraying the insincerity of those professions which inculcated a belief that having resorted to her orders with regret she was anxious to find an occasion for putting an end to them.Abandoning still more all respect for the neutral rights of the United States and for its own consistency the British government now demands as prerequisites to a repeal of its orders as they relate to the United States that a formality should be observed in the repeal of the French decrees nowise necessary to their termination nor exemplified by British usage and that the French repeal beses including that portion of the decrees which operates within a territorial jurisdiction as well as that which operates on the high seas against the commerce of the United States should not be a single and special repeal in relation to the United States but should be extended to whatever other neutral nations unconnected with them may be affected by those decrees. And as an additional insult they are called on for a formal disavowal of conditions and pretensions advanced by the French government for which the United States are so far from having made themselves responsible that in official explanations which have been published to the world and in a correspondence of the American minister at London with the British minister for foreign affairs such a responsibility was explicitly and emphatically disclaimed.It has become indeed sufficiently certain that the commerce of the United States is to be sacrificed not as interfering with the belligerent rights of Great Britain; not as supplying the wants of her enemies which she herself supplies; but as interfering with the monopoly which she covets for her own commerce and igation. She carries on a war against the lawful commerce of a friend that she may the better carry on a commerce with an enemy ? a commerce polluted by the forgeries and perjuries which are for the most part the only passports by which it can succeed.Anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injured nations the United States have withheld from Great Britain under successive modifications the benefits of a free intercourse with their market the loss of which could not but outweigh the profits accruing from her restrictions of our commerce with other nations. And to entitle these experiments to the more favorable conseration they were so framed as to enable her to place her adversary under the exclusive operation of them. To these appeals her government has been equally inflexible as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort rather than yield to the claims of justice or renounce the errors of a false pre. Nay so far were the attempts carried to overcome the attachment of the British cabinet to its unjust edicts that it received every encouragement within the competency of the executive branch of our government to expect that a repeal of them would be followed by a war between the United States and France unless the French edicts should also be repealed. Even this communication although silencing forever the plea of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in those edicts originally the sole plea for them received no attention.If no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British government against a repeal of its orders it might be found in the correspondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London and the British secretary for foreign affairs in 1810 on the question whether the ade of May 1806 was consered as in force or as not in force. It had been ascertained that the French government which urged this ade as the ground of its Berlin decree was willing in the event of its removal to repeal that decree which being followed by alternate repeals of the other offensive edicts might abolish the whole system on both ses. This inviting opportunity for accomplishing an object so important to the United States and professed so often to be the desire of both the belligerents was made known to the British government. As that government admits that an actual application of an adequate force is necessary to the existence of a legal ade and it was notorious that if such a force had ever been applied its long discontinuance had annulled the ade in question there could be no sufficient objection on the part of Great Britain to a formal revocation of it and no imaginable objection to a declaration of the fact that the ade d not exist. The declaration would have been consistent with her avowed principles of ade and would have enabled the United States to demand from France the pledged repeal of her decrees either with success in which case the way would have been opened for a general repeal of the belligerent edicts or without success in which case the United States would have been justified in turning their measures exclusively against France. The British government would however neither rescind the ade nor declare its nonexistence nor permit its nonexistence to be inferred and affirmed by the American plenipotentiary. On the contrary by representing the ade to be comprehended in the orders in council the United States were compelled so to regard it in their subsequent proceedings.There was a period when a favorable change in the policy of the British cabinet was justly consered as established. The minister plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty here proposed an adjustment of the differences more immediately endangering the harmony of the two countries. The proposition was accepted with the promptitude and cordiality corresponding with the invariable professions of this government. A foundation appeared to be la for a sincere and lasting reconciliation. The prospect however quickly vanished. The whole proceeding was disavowed by the British government without any explanations which could at that time repress the belief that the disavowal proceeded from a spirit of hostility to the commercial rights and prosperity of the United States; and it has since come into proof that at the very moment when the public minister was holding the language of friendship and inspiring confence in the sincerity of the negotiation with which he was charged a secret agent of his government was employed in intrigues having for their object a subversion of our government and a dismemberment of our happy union.In reing the conduct of Great Britain toward the United States our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare just renewed by the savages on one of our extensive frontiers ? a warfare which is known to spare neither age nor sex and to be distinguished by features peculiarly shocking to humanity. It is difficult to account for the activity and combinations which have for some time been developing themselves among tribes in constant intercourse with British traders and garrisons without connecting their hostility with that influence and without recollecting the authenticated examples of such interpositions heretofore furnished by the officers and agents of that government.Such is the spectacle of injuries and indignities which have been heaped on our country and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and conciliatory efforts have not been able to avert. It might at least have been expected that an enlightened nation if less urged by moral obligations or invited by friendly dispositions on the part of the United States would have found its true interest alone a sufficient motive to respect their rights and their tranquillity on the high seas; that an enlarged policy would have favored that free and general circulation of commerce in which the British nation is at all times interested and which in times of war is the best alleviation of its calamities to herself as well as to other belligerents; and more especially that the British cabinet would not for the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile markets have persevered in a course of measures which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable market of a great and growing country disposed to cultivate the mutual advantages of an active commerce.Other counsels have prevailed. Our moderation and conciliation have had no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge pretensions. We behold our seafaring citizens still the daily victims of lawless violence committed on the great common and highway of nations even within sight of the country which owes them protection. We behold our vessels freighted with the products of our soil and industry or returning with the honest proceeds of them wrested from their lawful destinations confiscated by prize courts no longer the organs of public law but the instruments of arbitrary edicts and their unfortunate crews dispersed and lost or forced or inveigled in British ports into British fleets whilst arguments are employed in support of these aggressions which have no foundation but in a principle equally supporting a claim to regulate our external commerce in all cases whatsoever.We behold in fine on the se of Great Britain a state of war against the United States and on the se of the United States a state of peace toward Great Britain.Whether the United States shall continue passive under these progressive usurpations and these accumulating wrongs or opposing force to force in defense of their national rights shall commit a just cause into the hands of the Almighty Disposer of Events avoing all connections which might entangle it in the contest or s of other powers and preserving a constant readiness to concur in an honorable reestablishment of peace and friendship is a solemn question which the Constitution wisely confes to the legislative department of the government. In recommending it to their early deliberations I am happy in the assurance that the decision will be worthy the enlightened and patriotic councils of a virtuous a free and a powerful nation.Having presented this  of the relations of the United States with Great Britain and of the solemn alternative grow mg out of them I proceed to remark that the communica tions last made to Congress on the subject of our relations with France will have shewn that since the revocation of her decrees as they violated the neutral rights of the United States her government has authorized illegal captures by its privateers and public ships and that other outrages have been practised on our vessels and our citizens It will have been seen also that no indemnity had been proved or satisfacto rily pledged for the extensive spoliations committed under the violent and retrospective orders of the French government against the property of our citizens seized within the jurisdic tion of France I abstain at this time from recommending to the conseration of Congress definitive measures with re spect to that nation in the expectation that the result of un closed discussions between our minister plenipotentiary at Paris and the French government will speedily enable Congress to dece with greater advantage on the course due to the rights the interests and the honor of our country. 
Whereas the Congress of the United States by a joint resolution of the two Houses have signified a request that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity as a day of public humiliation and prayer; andWhereas such a recommendation will enable the several religious denominations and societies so disposed to offer at one and the same time their common vows and adorations to Almighty God on the solemn occasion produced by the war in which has been pleased to permit the injustice of a foreign power to involve these United States:I do therefore recommend the third Thursday in August next as a convenient day to be set apart for the devout purposes of rendering the Sovereign of the Universe and the Benefactor of Mankind the public homage due to His holy attributes; of acknowledging the transgressions which might justly provoke the manifestations of His ine displeasure; of seeking His merciful forgiveness and His assistance in the great duties of repentance and amendment and especially of offering fervent supplications that in the present season of calamity and war would take the American people under His peculiar care and protection; that would gue their public councils animate their patriotism and bestow His blessing on their arms; that would inspire all nations with a love of justice and of concord and with a reverence for the unerring precept of our holy religion to do to others as they would require that others should do to them; and finally that turning the hearts of our enemies from the violence and injustice which sway their councils against us would hasten a restoration of the blessings of peace.Given at Washington the 9th day of July A. D. 1812.JAMES MADISON.By the Present:JAMES MONROESecretary of State.
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES  In compliance with the request of the House of Representatives expressed in their resolution of the 5th instant I proceed to give such information as is possessed of the effect of gunboats in the protection and defense of harbors of the numbers thought necessary and of the proposed distribution of them among the ports and harbors of the United States.  Under the present circumstances and governed by the intentions of the legislature as manifested by their annual appropriations of money for the purposes of defence it has been concluded to combine  1st land batteries furnished with heavy cannon and mortars and established on all the points around the place favorable for preventing vessels from lying before it; 2d movable artillery which may be carried as an occasion may require to points unproved with fixed batteries; 3d floating batteries; and 4th gunboats which may oppose an enemy at its entrance and cooperate with the batteries for his expulsion. On this subject professional men were consulted as far as we had opportunity. General Wilkinson and the late General Gates gave their opinions in writing in favor of the system as will be seen by their letters now communicated. The higher officers of the y gave the same opinions in separate conferences as their presence at the seat of government offered occasions of consulting them and no difference of judgment appeared on the subjects. Those of Commodore Barron and Captain Tingey now here are recently furnished in writing and transmitted herewith to the legislature. The efficacy of gunboats for the defence of harbors and of other smooth and enclosed waters may be estimated in part from that of galleys formerly much used but less powerful more costly in their construction and maintenance and requiring more men. But the gunboat itself is believed to be in use with every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defence. In the Mediterranean on which are several small powers whose system like ours is peace and defence few harbors are without this article of protection. Our own experience there of the effect of gunboats for harbor service is recent. Algiers is particularly known to have owed to a great provision of these vessels the safety of its city since the epoch of their construction. Before that it had been repeatedly insulted and injured. The effect of gunboats at present in the neighborhood of Gibraltar is well known and how much they were used both in the attack and defence of that place during a former war. The extensive resort to them by the two greatest al powers in the world on an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect shows their confence in their efficacy for the purposes for which they are suited. By the northern powers of Europe whose seas are particularly adapted to them they are still more used. The remarkable action between the Russian flotilla of gunboats and galleys and a Turkish fleet of shipsoftheline and frigates in the Liman sea 1788 will be readily recollected. The latter commanded by their most celebrated admiral were completely defeated and several of their shipsoftheline destroyed. From the opinions given as to the number of gunboats necessary for some of the principal seaports and from a  of all the towns and ports from Orleans to Maine inclusive entitled to protection in proportion to their situation and circumstances it is concluded that to give them a due measure of protection in time of war about two hundred gunboats will be requisite. According to first eas the following would be their general distribution liable to be varied on more mature examination and as circumstances shall vary that is to say:  To the Mississippi and its neighboring waters forty gunboats. To Savannah and Charleston and the harbors on each se from St. Mary's to Currituck twentyfive. To the Chesapeake and its waters twenty. To Delaware bay and river fifteen. To New York the Sound and waters as far as Cape Cod fifty. To Boston and the harbors north of Cape Cod fifty. < The flotilla assigned to these several stations might each be under the care of a particular commandant and the vessels composing them would in ordinary be distributed among the harbors within the station in proportion to their importance. Of these boats a proper proportion would be of the larger size such as those heretofore built capable of igating any seas and of reinforcing occasionally the strength of even the most distant port when menaced with danger. The resue would be confined to their own or the neighboring harbors would be smaller less furnished for accommodation and consequently less costly. Of the number supposed necessary seventythree are built or building and the hundred and twentyseven still to be proved would cost from five to six hundred thousand dollars. Having regard to the convenience of the treasury as well as to the resources of building it has been thought that one half of these might be built in the present year and the other half the next. With the legislature however it will rest to stop where we are or at any further point when they shall be of opinion that the number proved shall be sufficient for the object. At times when Europe as well as the United States shall be at peace it would not be proposed that more than six or eight of these vessels should be kept afloat. When Europe is in war treble that number might be necessary to be distributed among those particular harbors which foreign vessels of war are in the habit of frequenting for the purpose of preserving order therein. But they would be manned in ordinary with only their complement for igation relying on the seamen and militia of the port if called into action on sudden emergency. It would be only when the United States should themselves be at war that the whole number would be brought into actual service and would be ready in the first moments of the war to cooperate with other means for covering at once the line of our seaports. At all times those unemployed would be withdrawn into places not exposed to sudden enterprise hauled up under sheds from the sun and weather and kept in preservation with little expense for repairs or maintenance. It must be superfluous to observe that this species of al armament is proposed merely for defensive operation; that it can have but little effect toward protecting our commerce in the open seas even on our coast; and still less can it become an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war toward which it would furnish no means. 
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:In meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture it would have been highly satisfactory if I could have communicated a favorable result to the mission charged with negotiations for restoring peace. It was a just expectation from the respect due to the distinguished Sovereign who had invited them by his offer of mediation from the readiness with which the invitation was accepted on the part of the United States and from the pledge to be found in an act of their Legislature for the liberality which their plenipotentiaries would carry into the negotiations that no time would be lost by the British Government in embracing the experiment for hastening a stop to the effusion of blood. A prompt and cordial acceptance of the mediation on that se was the less to be doubted as it was of a nature not to submit rights or pretensions on either se to the decision of an umpire but to afford merely an opportunity honorable and desirable to both for discussing and if possible adjusting them for the interest of both. The British cabinet either mistaking our desire of peace for a dread of British power or misled by other fallacious calculations has disappointed this reasonable anticipation. No communications from our envoys having reached us no information on the subject has been received from that source; but it is known that the mediation was declined in the 1st instance and there is no evence notwithstanding the lapse of time that a change of disposition in the British councils has taken place or is to be expected. Under such circumstances a nation proud of its rights and conscious of its strength has no choice but an exertion of the 1 in support of the other. To this determination the best encouragement is derived from the success with which it has pleased the Almighty to bless our arms both on the land and on the water. Whilst proofs have been continued of the enterprise and skill of our cruisers public and private on the ocean and a trophy gained in the capture of a British by an American vessel of war after an action giving celebrity to the name of the victorious commander the great inland waters on which the enemy were also to be encountered have presented achievements of our al arms as brilliant in their character as they have been important in their consequences. On Lake Erie the squadron under command of Captain Perry having met the British squadron of superior force a sanguinary conflict ended in the capture of the whole. The conduct of that officer adroit as it was daring and which was so well seconded by his comrades justly entitles them to the admiration and gratitude of their country and will fill an early page in its al annals with a victory never surpassed in luster however much it may have been in magnitude. On Lake Ontario the caution of the British commander favored by contingencies frustrated the efforts of the American commander to bring on a decisive action. Captain Chauncey was able however to establish an ascendancy on that important theater and to prove by the manner in which he effected everything possible that opportunities only were wanted for a more shining display of his own talents and the gallantry of those under his command. The success on Lake Erie having opened a passage to the territory of the enemy the officer commanding the Northwestern army transferred the war thither and raply pursuing the hostile troops fleeing with their savage associates forced a general action which quickly terminated in the capture of the British and dispersion of the savage force. This result is signally honorable to MajorGeneral Harrison by whose military talents it was prepared; to Colonel Johnson and his mounted volunteers whose impetuous onset gave a decisive blow to the ranks of the enemy and to the spirit of the volunteer militia equally brave and patriotic who bore an interesting part in the scene; more especially to the chief magistrate of Kentucky at the head of them whose heroism signalized in the war which established the independence of his country sought at an advanced age a share in hardships and battles for maintaining its rights and its safely. The effect of these successes has been to rescue the inhabitants of MI from their oppressions aggravated by gross infractions of the capitulation which subjected them to a foreign power; to alienate the savages of numerous tribes from the enemy by whom they were disappointed and abandoned and to relieve an extensive region of country from a merciless warfare which desolated its frontiers and imposed on its citizens the most harassing services. In consequences of our al superiority on Lake Ontario and the opportunity afforded by it for concentrating our forces by water operations which had been provisionally planned were set on foot against the possessions of the enemy on the St. Lawrence. Such however was the delay produced in the 1st instance by adverse weather of unusual violence and continuance and such the circumstances attending the final movements of the army that the prospect at one time so favorable was not realized. The cruelty of the enemy in enlisting the savages into a war with a nation desirous of mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities has not been confined to any one quarter. Wherever they could be turned against us no exertions to effect it have been spared. On our southwestern border the Creek tribes who yielding to our persevering endeavors were gradually acquiring more civilized habits became the unfortunate victims of seduction. A war in that quarter has been the consequence infuriated by a bloody fanaticism recently propagated among them. It was necessary to crush such a war before it could spread among the contiguous tribes and before it could favor enterprises of the enemy into that vicinity. With this  a force was called into the service of the United States from the States of Georgia and Tennessee which with the nearest regular troops and other corps from the Massachussets Territory might not only chastise the savages into present peace but make a lasting impression on their fears. The progress of the expedition as far as is yet known corresponds with the martial zeal with which it was espoused and the best hopes of a satisfactory issue are authorized by the complete success with which a wellplanned enterprise was executed against a body of hostile savages by a detachment of the volunteer militia of TN under the gallant command of General Coffee and by a still more important victory over a larger body of them gained under the immediate command of MajorGeneral Jackson an officer equally distinguished for his patriotism and his military talents. The systematic perseverance of the enemy in courting the a of the savages in all quarters had the natural effect of kindling their ordinary propensity to war into a passion which even among those best disposed toward the United States was ready if not employed on our se to be turned against us. A departure from our protracted forbearance to accept the services tendered by them has thus been forced upon us. But in yielding to it the retaliation has been mitigated as much as possible both in its extent and in its character stopping far short of the example of the enemy who owe the advantages they have occasionally gained in battle chiefly to the # of their savage associates and who have not controlled them either from their usual practice of indiscriminate massacre on defenseless inhabitants or from scenes of carnage without a parallel on prisoners to the British arms guarded by all the laws of humanity and of honorable war. For these enormities the enemy are equally responsible whether with the power to prevent them they want the will or with the knowledge of a want of power they still avail themselves of such instruments. In other respects the enemy are pursuing a course which threatens consequences most afflicting to humanity. A standing law of Great Britain naturalizes as is well known all aliens complying with conditions limited to a shorter period than those required by the United States and naturalized subjects are in war employed by her Government in common with native subjects. In a contiguous British Province regulations promulgated since the commencement of the war compel citizens of the United States being there under certain circumstances to bear arms whilst of the native emigrants from the United States who compose much of the population of the Province a number have actually borne arms against the United States within their limits some of whom after having done so have become prisoners of war and are now in our possession. The British commander in that Province nevertheless with the sanction as appears of his Government thought proper to select from American prisoners of war and send to Great Britain for trial as criminals a # of inuals who had emigrated from the British dominions long prior to the state of war between the two nations who had incorporated themselves into our political society in the modes recognized by the law and the practice of Great Britain and who were made prisoners of war under the banners of their adopted country fighting for its rights and its safety. The protection due to these citizens requiring an effectual interposition in their behalf a like numver of British prisoners of war were put into confinement with a notification that they would experience whatever violence might be committed on the American prisoners of war sent to Great Britain. It was hoped that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly taken on the part of Great Britain would have led her Government to reflect on the inconsistencies of its conduct and that a sympathy with the British if not with the American sufferers would have arrested the cruel career opened by its example. This was unhappily not the case. In violation both of consistency and of humanity American officers and noncommissioned officers in double the number of the British soldiers confined here were ordered into close confinement with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the death which might be inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great Britain for trial the officers so confined would be put to death also. It was notified at the same time that the commanders of the British fleets and armies on our coasts are instructed in the same event to proceed with a destructive severity against our towns and their inhabitants. That no doubt might be left with the enemy of our adherence to the retaliatory resort imposed on us a correspondent number of British officers prisoners of war in our hands were immediately put into close confinement to abe the fate of those confined by the enemy and the British Government was apprised of the determination of this Government to retaliate any other proceedings against us contrary to the legitimate modes of warfare. It is fortunate for the United States that they have it in their power to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest as it is honorable to them that they do not join in it but under the most imperious obligations and with the humane purpose of effectuating a return to the established usages of war. The s of the French Government on the subjects which have been so long committed to negotiation have received no elucation since the close of your late session. The minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris had not been enabled by proper opportunities to press the objects of his mission as prescribed by his instructions. The militia being always to be regarded as the great bulwark of defense and security for free states and the Constitution having wisely committed to the national authority a use of that force as the best provision against an unsafe military establishment as well as a resource peculiarly adapted to a country having the extent and the exposure of the United States I recommend to Congress a revision of the militia laws for the purpose of securing more effectually the services of all detachments called into the employment and placed under the Government of the United States. It will deserve the conseration of Congress also whether among other improvements in the militia laws justice does not require a regulation under due precautions for defraying the expense incent to the 1st assembling as well as the subsequent movements of detachments called into the national service. To give to our vessels of war public and private the requisite advantage in their cruises it is of much importance that they should have both for themselves and their prizes the use of the ports and markets of friendly powers. With this  I recommend to Congress the expediency of such legal provisions as may supply the defects or remove the doubts of the Executive authority to allow to the cruisers of other powers at war with enemies of the United States such use of the American ports as may correspond with the privileges allowed by such powers to American cruisers. During the year ending on the 30 of September last the receipts into the Treasury have exceeded $37.5M of which near $24M were the produce of loans. After meeting all demands for the public service there remained in the Treasury on that day near $7M. Under the authority contained in the act of the 2nd of August last for borrowing $7.5M that sum has been obtained on terms more favorable to the United States than those of the preceding loans made during the present year. Further sums to a conserable amount will be necessary to be obtained in the same way during the ensuing year and from the increased capital of the country from the felity with which the public engagements have been kept and the public credit maintained it may be expected on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies will not be wanting. The expenses of the current year from the multiplied operations falling within it have necessarily been extensive; but on a just estimate of the campaign in which the mass of them has been incurred the cost will not be found disproportionate to the advantages which have been gained. The campaign has indeed in its latter stages in one quarter been less favorable than was expected but in addition to the importance of our al success the progress of the campaign has been filled with incents highly honorable to the American arms. The attacks of the enemy on Craney Island on Fort Meigs on Sacketts Harbor and on Sandusky have been vigorously and successfully repulsed; nor have they in any case succeeded on either frontier excepting when directed against the peaceable dwellings of inuals or villages unprepared or undefended. On the other hand the movements of the American Army have been followed by the reduction of York and of Forts George Erie and Malden; by the recovery of Detroit and the extinction of the Indian war in the West and by the occupancy or command of a large portion of Upper Canada. Battles have also been fought on the borders of the St. Lawrence which though not accomplishing their entire objects reflect honor on the discipline and prowess of our soldiery the best auguries of eventual victory. In the same scale are to be placed the late successes in the South over one of the most powerful which had become one of the most hostile also of the Indian tribes. It would be improper to close this communication without expressing a thankfulness in which all ought to unite for the abundance; for the preservation of our internal tranquillity and the stability of our free institutions and above all for the light of ine truth and the protection of every man's conscience in the enjoyment of it. And although among our blessings we can not number an exemption from the evils of war yet these will never be regarded as the greatest of evils by the friends of liberty and of the rights of nations. Our country has before preferred them to the degraded condition which was the alternative when the sword was drawn in the cause which gave birth to our national independence and none who con the magnitude and feel the value of that glorious event will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which it placed the American people. With all good citizens the justice and necessity of resisting wrongs and usurpations no longer to be borne will sufficiently outweigh the privations and sacrifices inseparable from a state of war. But it is a reflection moreover peculiarly consoling that whilst wars are generally aggravated by their baneful effects on the internal improvements and permanent prosperity of the nations engaged in them such is the favored situation of the United States that the calamities of the contest into which they have been compelled to enter are mitigated by improvements and advantages of which the contest itself is the source. If the war has increased the interruptions of our commerce it has at the same time cherished and multiplied our manufactures so as to make us independent of all other countries for the more essential branches for which we ought to be dependent on none and is even raply giving them an extent which will create additional staples in our future intercourse with foreign markets. If much treasure has been expended no inconserable portion of it has been applied to objects durable in their value and necessary to our permanent safety. If the war has exposed us to increased spoliations on the ocean and to predatory incursions on the land it has developed the national means of retaliating the former and of proving protection against the latter demonstrating to all that every blow aimed at our maritime independence is an impulse accelerating the growth of our maritime power. By diffusing through the mass of the nation the elements of military discipline and instruction; by augmenting and distributing warlike preparations applicable to future use; by evincing the zeal and valor with which they will be employed and the cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will be borne a greater respect for our rights and a longer duration of our future peace are promised than could be expected without these proofs of the national character and resources. The war has proved moreover that our free Government like other free governments though slow in its early movements acquires in its progress a force proportioned to its freedom and that the union of these States the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each is strengthened by every occasion that puts it to the test. In fine the war with all its vicissitudes is illustrating the capacity and the destiny of the United States to be a great a flourishing and a powerful nation worthy of the friendship which it is disposed to cultivate with all others and authorized by its own example to require from all an observance of the laws of justice and reciprocity. Beyond these their claims have never extended and in contending for these we behold a subject for our congratulations in the daily testimonies of increasing harmony throughout the nation and may humbly repose our trust in the smiles of Heaven on so righteous a cause. 
 Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The embarrassments which have prevailed in our foreign relations and so much employed the deliberations of Congress make it a primary duty in meeting you to communicate whatever may have occurred in that branch of our national affairs. The act of the last session of Congress concerning the commercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain and France and their dependencies having invited in a new form a termination of their edicts against our neutral commerce copies of the act were immediately forwarded to our ministers at London and Paris with a  that its object might be within the early attention of the French and British Governments.  By the communication received through our minister at Paris it appeared that knowledge of the act by the French Government was followed by a declaration that the Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked and would cease to have effect on the first day of November ensuing. These being the only known edicts of France within the description of the act and the revocation of them being such that they ceased at that date to violate our neutral commerce the fact as prescribed by law was announced by a proclamation bearing date the 2nd of November. It would have well accorded with the conciliatory s indicated by this proceeding on the part of France to have extended them to all the grounds of just complaint which now remain unadjusted with the United States. It was particularly anticipated that as a further evence of just dispositions toward them restoration would have been immediately made of the property of our citizens under a misapplication of the principle of reprisals combined with a misconstruction of a law of the United States. This expectation has not been fulfilled. From the British Government no communication on the subject of the act has been received. To a communication from our minister at London of a revocation by the French Government of its Berlin and Milan decrees it was answered that the British system would be relinquished as soon as the repeal of the French decrees should have actually taken effect and the commerce of neutral nations have been restored to the condition in which it stood previously to the promulgation of those decrees. This pledge although it does not necessarily import does not exclude the intention of relinquishing along with the others in council the practice of those novel ades which have a like effect of interrupting our neutral commerce and this further justice to the United States is the rather to be looked for in as much as the ades in question being not more contrary to the established law of nations than inconsistent with the rules of ade formally recognized by Great Britain herself could have no alleged basis other than the plea of retaliation alleged as the basis of the orders in council.  Under the modification of the original orders of 1807 November into the orders of 1809 April there is indeed scarcely a nominal distinction between the orders and the ades. One of those illegitimate ades bearing date in 1806 May having been expressly avowed to be still unrescinded and to be in effect comprehended in the orders in council was too distinctly brought within the pur of the act of Congress not to be comprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a compliance with it. The British Government was accordingly apprised by our minister near it that such was the light in which the subject was to be regarded.  On the other important subjects depending between the United States and the Government no progress has been made from which an early and satisfactory result can be relied on.  In this new posture of our relations with those powers the conseration of Congress will be properly turned to a removal of doubts which may occur in the exposition and of difficulties in the execution of the act above cited.  The commerce of the United States with the north of Europe heretofore much vexed by licentious cruisers particularly under the Danish flag has latterly been visited with fresh and extensive depredations. The measures pursued in behalf of our injured citizens not having obtained justice for them a further and more formal interposition with the Danish Government is cond. The principles which have been maintained by that Government in relation to neutral commerce and the friendly professions of His Danish Majesty toward the United States are valuable pledges in favor of a successful issue.  Among the events growing out of the state of the Spanish Monarchy our attention was imperiously attracted to the change developing itself in that portion of West Flora which though of right appertaining to the United States had remained in the possession of Spain awaiting the result of negotiations for its actual delivery to them. The Spanish authority was subverted and a situation produced exposing the country to ulterior events which might essentially affect the rights and welfare of the Union. In such a conjuncture I d not delay the interposition required for the occupancy of the territory west of the river Perdo to which the title of the United States extends and to which the laws proved for the Territory of Orleans are applicable. With this  the proclamation of which a copy is la before you was confed to the governor of that Territory to be carried into effect. The legality and necessity of the course pursued assure me of the favorable light in which it will present itself to the Legislature and of the promptitude with which they will supply whatever provisions may be due to the essential rights and equitable interests of the people thus brought into the bosom of the American family. Our amity with the powers of Barbary with the exception of a recent occurrence at Tunis of which an explanation is just received appears to have been uninterrupted and to have become more firmly established.  With the Indian tribes also the peace and friendship of the United States are found to be so eligible that the general disposition to preserve both continues to gain strength.  I feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an interior  of our country presents us with grateful proofs of its substantial and increasing prosperity. To a thriving agriculture and the improvements related to it is added a highly interesting extension of useful manufactures the combined product of professional occupations and of household industry. Such indeed is the experience of economy as well as of policy in these substitutes for supplies heretofore obtained by foreign commerce that in a national  the change is justly regarded as of itself more than a recompense for those privations and losses resulting from foreign injustice which furnished the general impulse required for its accomplishment. How far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor by regulations of the commercial tariff is a subject which can not fail to suggest itself to your patriotic reflections.  It will rest with the conseration of Congress also whether a provent as well as fair encouragement would not be given to our igation by such regulations as would place it on a level of competition with foreign vessels particularly in transporting the important and bulky productions of our own soil. The failure of equality and reciprocity in the existing regulations on this subject operates in our ports as a premium to foreign competitors and the inconvenience must increase as these may be multiplied under more favorable circumstances by the more than countervailing encouragements now given them by the laws of their respective countries.  Whilst it is universally admitted that a wellinstructed people alone can be permanently a free people and whilst it is event that the means of diffusing and improving useful knowledge form so small a proportion of the expenditures for national purposes I can not presume it to be unseasonable to invite your attention to the advantages of superadding to the means of education proved by the several States a seminary of learning instituted by the National Legislature within the limits of their exclusive jurisdiction the expense of which might be defrayed or reimbursed out of the vacant grounds which have accrued to the nation within those limits.  Such an institution though local in its legal character would be universal in its beneficial effects. By enlightening the opinions by expanding the patriotism and by assimilating the principles the sentiments and the manners of those who might resort to this temple of science to be redistributed in due time through every part of the community sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished the features of national character would be multiplied and greater extent given to social harmony. But above all a well constituted seminary in the center of the nation is recommended by the conseration that the additional instruction emanating from it would contribute not less to strengthen the foundations than to adorn the structure of our free and happy system of government.  Among the commercial abuses still committed under the American flag and leaving in force my former reference to that subject it appears that American citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved Africans equally in violation of the laws of humanity and in defiance of those of their own country. The same just and benevolent motives which produced interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be felt by Congress in devising further means of suppressing the evil.  In the mst of uncertainties necessarily connected with the great interests of the United States prudence requires a continuance of our defensive and precautionary arrangement. The Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy will submit the statements and estimates which may a Congress in their ensuing provisions for the land and al forces. The statements of the latter will include a  of the transfers of appropriations in the al expenditures and in the grounds on which they were made.  The fortifications for the defense of our maritime frontier have been prosecuted according to the plan la down in 1808. The works with some exceptions are completed and furnished with ordnance. Those for the security of the city of New York though far advanced toward completion will require a further time and appropriation. This is the case with a few others either not completed or in need of repairs.  The improvements in quality and quantity made in the manufacture of cannon and small arms both at the public armories and private factories warrant additional confence in the competency of these resources for supplying the public exigencies.  These preparations for arming the militia having thus far proved for 1 of the objects cond by the power vested in Congress with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety it is for their conseration whether further provisions are not requisite for the other cond objects of organization and discipline. To give to this great mass of physical and moral force the efficiency which it merits and is capable of receiving it is indispensable that they should be instructed and practiced in the rules by which they are to be governed. Toward an accomplishment of this important work I recommend for the conseration of Congress the expediency of instituting a system which shall in the first instance call into the field at the public expense and for a given time certain portions of the commissioned and noncommissioned officers. The instruction and discipline thus acquired would gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia that practical knowledge and promptitude for active service which are the great ends to be pursued. Experience has left no doubt either of the necessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those portions of an army in fitting it for the final duties which it may have to perform.  The Corps of Engineers with the Military Academy are entitled to the early attention of Congress. The buildings at the seat fixed by law for the present Academy are so far in decay as not to afford the necessary accommodation. But a revision of the law is recommended principally with a  to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantages of such institutions by proving professorships for all the necessary branches of military instruction and by the establishment of an additional academy at the seat of Government or elsewhere. The means by which war as well for defense as for offense are now carried on render these schools of the more scientific operations an indispensable part of every adequate system.  Even among nations whose large standing armies and frequent wars afford every other opportunity of instruction these establishments are found to be indispensable for the due attainment of the branches of military science which require a regular course of study and experiment. In a government happily without the other opportunities seminaries where the elementary principles of the art of war can be taught without actual war and without the expense of extensive and standing armies have the precious advantage of uniting an essential preparation against external danger with a scrupulous regard to internal safety. In no other way probably can a provision of equal efficacy for the public defense be made at so little expense or more consistently with the public liberty.  The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last (and amounting to more than $8.5M) have exceeded the current expenses of the Government including the interest on the public debt. For the purpose of reimbursing at the end of the year $3.75 of the principal a loan as authorized by law had been negotiated to that amount but has since been reduced to $2.75M the reduction being permitted by the state of the Treasury in which there will be a balance remaining at the end of the year estimated at $2M. For the probably receipts of the next year and other details I refer to statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury and which will enable you to judge what further provisions may be necessary for the ensuing years.  Reserving for future occasions in the course of the session whatever other communications may claim your attention I close the present by expressing my reliance under the blessing of Divine Provence on the judgement and patriotism which will gue your measures at a period particularly calling for united councils and flexible exertions for the welfare of our country and by assuring you of the felity and alacrity with which my cooperation will be afforded. 
 Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:At the period of our last meeting I had the satisfaction of communicating an adjustment with one of the principal belligerent nations highly important in itself and still more so as presaging a more extended accommodation. It is with deep concern I am now to inform you that the favorable prospect has been overclouded by a refusal of the British Government to abe by the act of its minister plenipotentiary and by its ensuing policy toward the United States as seen through the communications of the minister sent to replace him.  Whatever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements formed by diplomatic aries in cases where by the terms of the engagements a mutual ratification is reserved or where notice at the time may have been given of a departure from instructions or in extraordinary cases essentially violating the principles of equity a disavowal could not have been apprehended in a case where no such notice or violation existed where no such ratification was reserved and more especially where as is now in proof an engagement to be executed without any such ratification was cond by the instructions given and where it had with good faith been carried into immediate execution on the part of the United States. These conserations not having restrained the British Government from disavowing the arrangement by virtue of which its orders in council were to be revoked and the event authorizing the renewal of commercial intercourse having thus not taken place it necessarily became a question of equal urgency and importance whether the act prohibiting that intercourse was not to be consered as remaining in legal force. This question being after due deliberation determined in the affirmative a proclamation to that effect was issued. It could not but happen however that a return to this state of things from that which had followed an execution of the arrangement by the United States would involve difficulties. With a  to diminish these as much as possible the instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury now la before you were transmitted to the collectors of the several ports. If in permitting British vessels to depart without giving bonds not to proceed to their own ports it should appear that the tenor of legal authority has not been strictly pursued it is to be ascribed to the anxious desire which was felt that no inuals should be injured by so unforeseen an occurrence; and I rely on the regard of Congress for the equitable interests of our own citizens to adopt whatever further provisions may be found requisite for a general remission of penalties involuntarily incurred. The recall of the disavowed minister having been followed by the appointment of a successor hopes were indulged that the new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment which had been produced and to remove the causes which had so long embarrassed the good understanding of the two nations. It could not be doubted that it would at least be charged with conciliatory explanations of the step which had been taken and with proposals to be substituted for the rejected arrangement. Reasonable and universal as this expectation was it also has not been fulfilled. From the first official disclosures of the new minister it was found that he had received no authority to enter into explanations relative to either branch of the arrangement disavowed nor any authority to substitute proposals as to that branch which concerned the British orders in council and finally that his proposals WRT the other branch the attack on the frigate Chesapeake were founded on a presumption repeatedly declared to be inadmissible by the United States that the first step toward adjustment was due from them the proposals at the same time omitting even a reference to the officer answerable for the murderous aggression and asserting a claim not less contrary to the British laws and British practice than to the principles and obligations of the United States. The correspondence between the Department of State and this minister will show how unessentially the features presented in its commencement have been varied in its progress. It will sow also that forgetting the respect due to all governments he d not refrain from imputations on this which required that no further communications should be received from him. The necessity of this step will be made known to His Britannic Majesty through the minister plenipotentiary of the United States in London; and it would indicate a want of the confence due to a Government which so well understands and exacts what becomes foreign ministers near it not to infer that the misconduct of its own representative will be ed in the same light in which it has been regarded here. The British Government will learn at the same time that a ready attention will be given to communications through any channel which may be substituted. It will be happy if the change in this respect should be accompanied by a favorable revision of the unfriendly policy which has been so long pursued toward the United States. With France the other belligerent whose trespasses on our commercial rights have long been the subject of our just remonstrances the posture of our relations does not correspond with the measures taken on the part of the United States to effect a favorable change. The result of the several communications made to her Government in pursuance of the authorities vested by Congress in the Executive is contained in the correspondence of our minister at Paris now la before you. By some of the other belligerents although professing just and amicable dispositions injuries materially affecting our commerce have not been duly controlled or repressed. In these cases the interpositions deemed proper on our part have not been omitted. But it well deserves the conseration of the Legislature how far both the safety and the honor of the American flag may be consulted by adequate provisions against that collusive prostitution of it by inuals unworthy of the American name which has so much flavored the real or pretended suspicions under which the honest commerce of their fellow citizens has suffered. In relation to the powers on the coast of Barbary nothing has occurred which is not of a nature rather to inspire confence than distrust as to the continuance of the existing amity. With our Indian neighbors the just and benevolent system continued toward them has also preserved peace and is more and more advancing habits favorable to their civilization and happiness. From a statement which will be made by the Secretary of War it will be seen that the fortifications on our maritime frontier are in many of the ports completed affording the defense which was cond and that a further time will be required to render complete the works in the harbor of New York and in some other places. By the enlargement of the works and the employment of a greater number of hands at the public armories the supply of small arms of an improving quality appears to be annually increasing at a rate that with those made on private contract may be expected to go far toward proving for the public exigency. The act of Congress proving for the equipment of our vessels of war having been fully carried into execution I refer to the statement of the Secretary of the Navy for the information which may be proper on that subject. To that statement is added a  of the transfers of appropriations authorized by the act of the session preceding the last and of the grounds on which the transfers were made. Whatever may be the course of your deliberations on the subject of our military establishments I should fail in my duty in not recommending to your serious attention the importance of giving to our militia the great bulwark of our security and resource of our power an organization best adapted to eventual situations for which the United States ought to be prepared. The sums which had been previously accumulated in the Treasury together with the receipts during the year ending on the 30th of September last (and amounting to more than $9M) have enabled us to fulfill all our engagements and to defray the current expenses of Government without recurring to any loan. But the insecurity of our commerce and the consequent diminution of the public revenue will probably produce a deficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year for which and for other details I refer to the statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury. In the state which has been presented of our affairs with the great parties to a disastrous and protracted war carried on in a mode equally injurious and unjust to the United States as a neutral nation the wisdom of the National Legislature will be again summoned to the important decision on the alternatives before them. That these will be met in a spirit worthy the councils of a nation conscious both of its rectitude and of its rights and careful as well of its honor as of its peace I have an entire confence; and that the result will be stamped by a unanimity becoming the occasion and be supported by every portion of our citizens with a patriotism enlightened and invigorated by experience ought as little to be doubted. In the mst of the wrongs and vexations experienced from external causes there is much room for congratulation on the prosperity and happiness flowing from our situation at home. The blessing of health has never been more universal. The fruits of the seasons though in particular articles and districts short of their usual redundancy are more than sufficient for our wants and our comforts. The face of our country every presents evence of laudable enterprise of extensive capital and of durable improvement. In a cultivation of the materials and the extension of useful manufactures more especially in the general application to household fabrics we behold a rap diminution of our dependence on foreign supplies. Nor is it unworthy of reflection that this revolution in our pursuits and habits is in no slight degree a consequence of those impolitic and arbitrary edicts by which the contending nations in endeavoring each of them to obstruct our trade with the other have so far abrged our means of procuring the productions and manufactures of which our own are now taking the place. Recollecting always that for every advantage which may contribute to distinguish our lot from that to which others are doomed by the unhappy spirit of the times we are indebted to that Divine Provence whose goodness has been so remarkably extended to this rising nation it becomes us to cherish a devout gratitude and to implore from the same omnipotent source a blessing on the consultations and measures about to be undertaken for the welfare of our beloved country. 
FellowCitizens:I shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotions which the new and very distinguished proof of the confence of my fellowcitizens evinced by my reelection to this high trust has excited in my bosom. The approbation which it announces of my conduct in the preceding term affords me a consolation which I shall profoundly feel through life. The general accord with which it has been expressed adds to the great and neverceasing obligations which it imposes. To merit the continuance of this good opinion and to carry it with me into my retirement as the solace of advancing years will be the object of my most zealous and unceasing efforts.  Having no pretensions to the high and commanding claims of my predecessors whose names are so much more conspicuously entified with our Revolution and who contributed so preeminently to promote its success I conser myself rather as the instrument than the cause of the union which has prevailed in the late election. In surmounting in favor of my humble pretensions the difficulties which so often produce ision in like occurrences it is obvious that other powerful causes indicating the great strength and stability of our Union have essentially contributed to draw you together. That these powerful causes exist and that they are permanent is my fixed opinion; that they may produce a like accord in all questions touching however remotely the liberty prosperity and happiness of our country will always be the object of my most fervent prayers to the Supreme Author of All Good. In a government which is founded by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty it seems proper that the person who may be placed by their suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its duties the principles on which he intends to conduct the Administration. If the person thus elected has served the preceding term an opportunity is afforded him to re its principal occurrences and to give such further explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful to his constituents. The events of one year have influence on those of another and in like manner of a preceding on the succeeding Administration. The movements of a great nation are connected in all their parts. If errors have been committed they ought to be corrected; if the policy is sound it ought to be supported. It is by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that our fellowcitizens are enabled to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future. Just before the commencement of the last term the United States had concluded a war with a very powerful nation on conditions equal and honorable to both parties. The events of that war are too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from me. Our commerce had been in a great measure driven from the sea our Atlantic and inland frontiers were invaded in almost every part; the waste of life along our coast and on some parts of our inland frontiers to the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizens were called was immense in addition to which not less than $120000000 were added at its end to the public debt. As soon as the war had terminated the nation admonished by its events resolved to place itself in a situation which should be better calculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil and in case it should recur to mitigate its calamities. With this  after reducing our land force to the basis of a peace establishment which has been further modified since provision was made for the construction of fortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our al force as should be well adapted to both purposes. The laws making this provision were passed in 1815 and 1816 and it has been since the constant effort of the Executive to carry them into effect. The advantage of these fortifications and of an augmented al force in the extent cond in a point of economy has been fully illustrated by a report of the Board of Engineers and Naval Commissioners lately communicated to Congress by which it appears that in an invasion by 20000 men with a correspondent al force in a campaign of six months only the whole expense of the construction of the works would be defrayed by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the a of those works and that which would be incurred without them. The reason of this difference is obvious. If fortifications are judiciously placed on our great inlets as distant from our cities as circumstances will permit they will form the only points of attack and the enemy will be detained there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable our militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made. A force adequate to the enemy collected at that single point with suitable preparation for such others as might be menaced is all that would be requisite. But if there were no fortifications then the enemy might go where he pleased and changing his position and sailing from place to place our force must be called out and spread in vast numbers along the whole coast and on both ses of every bay and river as high up in each as it might be igable for ships of war. By these fortifications supported by our Navy to which they would afford like support we should present to other powers an armed front from St. Croix to the Sabine which would protect in the event of war our whole coast and interior from invasion; and even in the wars of other powers in which we were neutral they would be found eminently useful as by keeping their public ships at a distance from our cities peace and order in them would be preserved and the Government be protected from insult. It need scarcely be remarked that these measures have not been resorted to in a spirit of hostility to other powers. Such a disposition does not exist toward any power. Peace and good will have been and will hereafter be cultivated with all and by the most faithful regard to justice. They have been dictated by a love of peace of economy and an earnest desire to save the lives of our fellowcitizens from that destruction and our country from that devastation which are inseparable from war when it finds us unprepared for it. It is believed and experience has shown that such a preparation is the best expedient that can be resorted to prevent war. I add with much pleasure that conserable progress has already been made in these measures of defense and that they will be completed in a few years consering the great extent and importance of the object if the plan be zealously and steadily persevered in. The conduct of the Government in what relates to foreign powers is always an object of the highest importance to the nation. Its agriculture commerce manufactures fisheries revenue in short its peace may all be affected by it. Attention is therefore due to this subject. At the period adverted to the powers of Europe after having been engaged in long and destructive wars with each other had concluded a peace which happily still exists. Our peace with the power with whom we had been engaged had also been concluded. The war between Spain and the colonies in South America which had commenced many years before was then the only conflict that remained unsettled. This being a contest between different parts of the same community in which other powers had not interfered was not affected by their accommodations. This contest was consered at an early stage by my predecessor a civil war in which the parties were entitled to equal rights in our ports. This decision the first made by any power being formed on great conseration of the comparative strength and resources of the parties the length of time and successful opposition made by the colonies and of all other circumstances on which it ought to depend was in strict accord with the law of nations. Congress has invariably acted on this principle having made no change in our relations with either party. Our attitude has therefore been that of neutrality between them which has been maintained by the Government with the strictest impartiality. No a has been afforded to either nor has any privilege been enjoyed by the one which has not been equally open to the other party and every exertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the laws prohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both. By this equality between the parties their public vessels have been received in our ports on the same footing; they have enjoyed an equal right to purchase and export arms munitions of war and every other supply the exportation of all articles whatever being permitted under laws which were passed long before the commencement of the contest; our citizens have traded equally with both and their commerce with each has been alike protected by the Government. Respecting the attitude which it may be proper for the United States to maintain hereafter between the parties I have no hesitation in stating it as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observed should still be adhered to. From the change in the Government of Spain and the negotiation now depending invited by the Cortes and accepted by the colonies it may be presumed that their differences will be settled on the terms proposed by the colonies. Should the war be continued the United States regarding its occurrences will always have it in their power to adopt such measures respecting it as their honor and interest may require. Shortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a system of buccaneering in the neighboring seas to the great annoyance of the commerce of the United States and as was represented of that of other powers. Of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the United States strong proofs were afforded by the establishment at Amelia Island and the purposes to which it was made instrumental by this band in 1817 and by the occurrences which took place in other parts of Flora in 1818 the details of which in both instances are too well known to require to be now recited. I am satisfied had a less decisive course been adopted that the worst consequences would have resulted from it. We have seen that these checks decisive as they were were not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit. Many culprits brought within our limits have been condemned to suffer death the punishment due to that atrocious crime. The decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals fall equally on all whose crimes subject them by a fair interpretation of the law to its censure. It belongs to the Executive not to suffer the executions under these decisions to transcend the great purpose for which punishment is necessary. The full benefit of example being secured policy as well as humanity equally forbs that they should be carried further. I have acted on this principle pardoning those who appear to have been led astray by ignorance of the criminality of the acts they had committed and suffering the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuating circumstances could be urged. Great confence is entertained that the late treaty with Spain which has been ratified by both the parties and the ratifications whereof have been exchanged has placed the relations of the two countries on a basis of permanent friendship. The provision made by it for such of our citizens as have claims on Spain of the character described will it is presumed be very satisfactory to them and the boundary which is established between the territories of the parties westward of the Mississippi heretofore in dispute has it is thought been settled on conditions just and advantageous to both. But to the acquisition of Flora too much importance can not be attached. It secures to the United States a territory important in itself and whose importance is much increased by its bearing on many of the highest interests of the Union. It opens to several of the neighboring States a free passage to the ocean through the Province ceded by several rivers having their sources high up within their limits. It secures us against all future annoyance from powerful Indian tribes. It gives us several excellent harbors in the Gulf of Mexico for ships of war of the largest size. It covers by its position in the Gulf the Mississippi and other great waters within our extended limits and thereby enables the United States to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable productions of our whole Western country which find a market through those streams. By a treaty with the British Government bearing date on the 20th of October 1818 the convention regulating the commerce between the United States and Great Britain concluded on the 3d of July 1815 which was about expiring was revived and continued for the term of ten years from the time of its expiration. By that treaty also the differences which had arisen under the treaty of Ghent respecting the right claimed by the United States for their citizens to take and cure fish on the coast of His Britannic Majesty's dominions in America with other differences on important interests were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties. No agreement has yet been entered into respecting the commerce between the United States and the British dominions in the West Indies and on this continent. The restraints imposed on that commerce by Great Britain and reciprocated by the United States on a principle of defense continue still in force. The negotiation with France for the regulation of the commercial relations between the two countries which in the course of the last summer had been commenced at Paris has since been transferred to this city and will be pursued on the part of the United States in the spirit of conciliation and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an arrangement satisfactory to both parties. Our relations with the Barbary Powers are preserved in the same state and by the same means that were employed when I came into this office. As early as 1801 it was found necessary to send a squadron into the Mediterranean for the protection of our commerce and no period has intervened a short term excepted when it was thought advisable to withdraw it. The great interests which the United States have in the Pacific in commerce and in the fisheries have also made it necessary to maintain a al force there. In disposing of this force in both instances the most effectual measures in our power have been taken without interfering with its other duties for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighboring seas. The situation of the United States in regard to their resources the extent of their revenue and the facility with which it is raised affords a most gratifying spectacle. The payment of nearly $67000000 of the public debt with the great progress made in measures of defense and in other improvements of various kinds since the late war are conclusive proofs of this extraordinary prosperity especially when it is recollected that these expenditures have been defrayed without a burthen on the people the direct tax and excise having been repealed soon after the conclusion of the late war and the revenue applied to these great objects having been raised in a manner not to be felt. Our great resources therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interests of the nation. For all such purposes they are inexhaustible. They are more especially to be found in the virtue patriotism and intelligence of our fellowcitizens and in the devotion with which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their property in support of the rights and honor of their country. Under the present depression of prices affecting all the productions of the country and every branch of industry proceeding from causes explained on a former occasion the revenue has conserably diminished the effect of which has been to compel Congress either to abandon these great measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to supply the deficiency. On the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arising from it would be temporary loans were authorized for the demands of the last and present year. Anxious to relieve my fellowcitizens in 1817 from every burthen which could be dispensed with and the state of the Treasury permitting it I recommended the repeal of the internal taxes knowing that such relief was then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertions made in the late war. I made that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigencies require a recurrence to them at any time while I remained in this trust I would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on me. By the experiment now making it will be seen by the next session of Congress whether the revenue shall have been so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purposes. Should the deficiency still continue and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent the course to be pursued appears to me to be obvious. I am satisfied that under certain circumstances loans may be resorted to with great advantage. I am equally well satisfied as a general rule that the demands of the current year especially in time of peace should be proved for by the revenue of that year. I have never dreaded nor have I ever shunned in any situation in which I have been placed making appeals to the virtue and patriotism of my fellowcitizens well knowing that they could never be made in vain especially in times of great emergency or for purposes of high national importance. Independently of the exigency of the case many conserations of great weight urge a policy having in  a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demands of the nation without relying altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce. I am satisfied that internal duties and excises with corresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind would without imposing any serious burdens on the people enhance the price of produce promote our manufactures and augment the revenue at the same time that they made it more secure and permanent. The care of the Indian tribes within our limits has long been an essential part of our system but unfortunately it has not been executed in a manner to accomplish all the objects intended by it. We have treated them as independent nations without their having any substantial pretensions to that rank. The distinction has flattered their pre retarded their improvement and in many instances paved the way to their destruction. The progress of our settlements westward supported as they are by a dense population has constantly driven them back with almost the total sacrifice of the lands which they have been compelled to abandon. They have claims on the magnanimity and I may add on the justice of this nation which we must all feel. We should become their real benefactors; we should perform the office of their Great Father the endearing title which they emphatically give to the Chief Magistrate of our Union. Their sovereignty over vast territories should cease in lieu of which the right of soil should be secured to each inual and his posterity in competent portions; and for the territory thus ceded by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be granted to be vested in permanent funds for the support of civil government over them and for the education of their children for their instruction in the arts of husbandry and to prove sustenance for them until they could prove it for themselves. My earnest hope is that Congress will digest some plan founded on these principles with such improvements as their wisdom may suggest and carry it into effect as soon as it may be practicable. Europe is again unsettled and the prospect of war increasing. Should the flame light up in any quarter how far it may extend it is impossible to foresee. It is our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the causes which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere. With every power we are in perfect amity and it is our interest to remain so if it be practicable on just conditions. I see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power unless it proceed from a violation of our maritime rights. In these contests should they occur and to whatever extent they may be carried we shall be neutral; but as a neutral power we have rights which it is our duty to maintain. For like injuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit of amity in full confence that injuring none none would knowingly injure us. For more imminent dangers we should be prepared and it should always be recollected that such preparation adapted to the circumstances and sanctioned by the judgment and wishes of our constituents can not fail to have a good effect in averting dangers of every kind. We should recollect also that the season of peace is best adapted to these preparations. If we turn our attention fellowcitizens more immediately to the internal concerns of our country and more especially to those on which its future welfare depends we have every reason to anticipate the happiest results. It is now rather more than fortyfour years since we declared our independence and thirtyseven since it was acknowledged. The talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were a sure presage of all that has since followed. A people who were able to surmount in their infant state such great perils would be more competent as they rose into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their progress. Their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign danger and the practice of selfgovernment aed by the light of experience could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on all those questions connected with the internal organization. These favorable anticipations have been realized. In our whole system national and State we have shunned all the defects which unceasingly preyed on the vitals and destroyed the ancient Republics. In them there were distinct orders a nobility and a people or the people governed in one assembly. Thus in the one instance there was a perpetual conflict between the orders in society for the ascendency in which the victory of either terminated in the overthrow of the government and the ruin of the state; in the other in which the people governed in a body and whose dominions seldom exceeded the dimensions of a county in one of our States a tumultuous and disorderly movement permitted only a transitory existence. In this great nation there is but one order that of the people whose power by a peculiarly happy improvement of the representative principle is transferred from them without impairing in the slightest degree their sovereignty to bodies of their own creation and to persons elected by themselves in the full extent necessary for all the purposes of free enlightened and efficient government. The whole system is elective the complete sovereignty being in the people and every officer in every department deriving his authority from and being responsible to them for his conduct. Our career has corresponded with this great outline. Perfection in our organization could not have been expected in the outset either in the National or State Governments or in tracing the line between their respective powers. But no serious conflict has arisen nor any contest but such as are managed by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people and many of the defects which experience had clearly demonstrated in both Governments have been remedied. By steadily pursuing this course in this spirit there is every reason to believe that our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of which human institutions are capable and that the movement in all its branches will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command the admiration and respect of the civilized world. Our physical attainments have not been less eminent. Twentyfive years ago the river Mississippi was shut up and our Western brethren had no outlet for their commerce. What has been the progress since that time? The river has not only become the property of the United States from its source to the ocean with all its tributary streams (with the exception of the upper part of the Red River only) but Louisiana with a fair and liberal boundary on the western se and the Floras on the eastern have been ceded to us. The United States now enjoy the complete and uninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from St. Croix to the Sabine. New States settled from among ourselves in this and in other parts have been admitted into our Union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with the original States. Our population has augmented in an astonishing degree and extended in every direction. We now fellowcitizens comprise within our limits the dimensions and faculties of a great power under a Government possessing all the energies of any government ever known to the Old World with an utter incapacity to oppress the people. Entering with these s the office which I have just solemnly sworn to execute with felity and to the utmost of my ability I derive great satisfaction from a knowledge that I shall be assisted in the several Departments by the very enlightened and upright citizens from whom I have received so much a in the preceding term. With full confence in the continuance of that candor and generous indulgence from my fellowcitizens at large which I have heretofore experienced and with a firm reliance on the protection of Almighty God I shall forthwith commence the duties of the high trust to which you have called me. 
Unwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority I avail myself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression made on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of which I am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions. So distinguished a mark of confence proceeding from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation would under any circumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion as well as filled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed. Under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period I feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced. The present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel and that of our own country full of difficulties. The pressure of these too is the more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a moment when the national prosperity being at a height not before attained the contrast resulting from the change has been rendered the more striking. Under the benign influence of our republican institutions and the maintenance of peace with all nations whilst so many of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and resources. Proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture in the successful enterprises of commerce in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land. It is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which has for some time been distressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable s nor as I trust on any involuntary errors in the public councils. Indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations it has been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by observing justice and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality. If there be candor in the world the truth of these assertions will not be questioned; posterity at least will do justice to them. This unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the belligerent powers. In their rage against each other or impelled by more direct motives principles of retaliation have been introduced equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledged law. How long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the demonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the United States and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a revocation of them can not be anticipated. Assuring myself that under every vicissitude the determined spirit and united councils of the nation will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests I repair to the post assigned me with no other discouragement than what springs from my own inadequacy to its high duties. If I do not sink under the weight of this deep conviction it is because I find some support in a consciousness of the purposes and a confence in the principles which I bring with me into this arduous service. To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nations; to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms; to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities so degrading to all countries and so baneful to free ones; to foster a spirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others too proud to surrender our own too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves and too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to hold the union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness; to support the Constitution which is the cement of the Union as well in its limitations as in its authorities; to respect the rights and authorities reserved to the States and to the people as equally incorporated with and essential to the success of the general system; to avo the slightest interference with the right of conscience or the s of religion so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction; to preserve in their full energy the other salutary provisions in behalf of private and personal rights and of the freedom of the press; to observe economy in public expenditures; to liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge of the public debts; to keep within the requisite limits a standing military force always remembering that an armed and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of republicsthat without standing armies their liberty can never be in danger nor with large ones safe; to promote by authorized means improvements friendly to agriculture to manufactures and to external as well as internal commerce; to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty; to carry on the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized stateas far as sentiments and intentions such as these can a the fulfillment of my duty they will be a resource which can not fail me. It is my good fortune moreover to have the path in which I am to tread lighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties by those who have marched before me. Of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak. I may however be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my heart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved country gratefully bestowed or exalted talents zealously devoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness. But the source to which I look or the as which alone can supply my deficiencies is in the welltried intelligence and virtue of my fellowcitizens and in the counsels of those representing them in the other departments associated in the care of the national interests. In these my confence will under every difficulty be best placed next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future. 
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:On our present meeting it is my first duty to invite your attention to the provential favors which our country has experienced in the unusual degree of health dispensed to its inhabitants and in the rich abundance with which the earth has rewarded the labors bestowed on it. In the successful cultivation of other branches of industry and in the progress of general improvement favorable to the national prosperity there is just occasion also for our mutual congratulations and thankfulness.With these blessings are necessarily mingled the pressures and vicissitudes incent to the state of war into which the United States have been forced by the perseverance of a foreign power in its system of injustice and aggression.Previous to its declaration it was deemed proper as a measure of precaution and forecast that a conserable force should be placed in the Michigan Territory with a general  to its security and in the event of war to such operations in the uppermost Canada as would intercept the hostile influence of Great Britain over the savages obtain the command of the lake on which that part of Canada borders and maintain cooperating relations with such forces as might be most conveniently employed against other parts.BrigadierGeneral Hull was charged with this provisional service having under his command a body of troops composed of regulars and of volunteers from the State of Ohio. Having reached his destination after his knowledge of the war and possessing discretionary authority to act offensively he passed into the neighboring territory of the enemy with a prospect of easy and victorious progress. The expedition nevertheless terminated unfortunately not only in a retreat to the town and fort of Detroit but in the surrender of both and of the gallant corps commanded by that officer. The causes of this painful reverse will be investigated by a military tribunal.A distinguishing feature in the operations which preceded and followed this adverse event is the use made by the enemy of the merciless savages under their influence. Whilst the benevolent policy of the United States invariably recommended peace and promoted civilization among that wretched portion of the human race and was making exertions to dissuade them from taking either se in the war the enemy has not scrupled to call to his a their ruthless ferocity armed with the horrors of those instruments of carnage and torture which are known to spare neither age nor sex. In this outrage against the laws of honorable war and against the feelings sacred to humanity the British commanders can not resort to a plea of retaliation for it is committed in the face of our example. They can not mitigate it by calling it a selfdefense against men in arms for it embraces the most shocking butcheries of defenseless families. Nor can it be pretended that they are not answerable for the atrocities perpetrated since the savages are employed with a knowledge and even with menaces that their fury could not be controlled. Such is the spectacle which the deputed authorities of a nation boasting its religion and morality have not been restrained from presenting to an enlightened age.The misfortune at Detroit was not however without a consoling effect. It was followed by signal proofs that the national spirit rises according to the pressure on it. The loss of an important post and of the brave men surrendered with it inspired everywhere new ardor and determination. In the States and districts least remote it was no sooner known than every citizen was ready to fly with his arms at once to protect his brethren against the bloodthirsty savages let loose by the enemy on an extensive frontier and to convert a partial calamity into a source of invigorated efforts. This patriotic zeal which it was necessary rather to limit than excite has embodied an ample force from the States of Kentucky and Ohio and from parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is placed with the addition of a few regulars under the command of BrigadierGeneral Harrison who possesses the entire confence of his fellow soldiers among whom are citizens some of them volunteers in the ranks not less distinguished by their political stations than by their personal merits. The greater portion of this force is proceeding in relieving an important frontier post and in several incental operations against hostile tribes of savages rendered indispensable by the subserviency into which they had been seduced by the enemy  a seduction the more cruel as it could not fail to impose a necessity of precautionary severities against those who yielded to it.At a recent date an attack was made on a post of the enemy near Niagara by a detachment of the regular and other forces under the command of MajorGeneral Van Rensselaer of the militia of the State of New York. The attack it appears was ordered in compliance with the ardor of the troops who executed it with distinguished gallantry and were for a time victorious; but not receiving the expected support they were compelled to yield to reenforcements of British regulars and savages. Our loss has been conserable and is deeply to be lamented. That of the enemy less ascertained will be the more felt as it includes among the killed the commanding general who was also the governor of the Province and was sustained by veteran troops from unexperienced soldiers who must daily improve in the duties of the field.Our expectation of gaining the command of the Lakes by the invasion of Canada from Detroit having been disappointed measures were instantly taken to prove on them a al force superior to that of the enemy. From the talents and activity of the officer charged with this object everything that can be done may be expected. Should the present season not admit of complete success the progress made will insure for the next a al ascendancy where it is essential to our permanent peace with and control over the savages.Among the incents to the measures of the war I am constrained to advert to the refusal of the governors of Maine and Connecticut to furnish the required detachments of militia toward the defense of the maritime frontier. The refusal was founded on a novel and unfortunate exposition of the provisions of the Constitution relating to the militia. The correspondences which will be la before you contain the requisite information on the subject. It is obvious that if the authority of the United States to call into service and command the militia for the public defense can be thus frustrated even in a state of declared war and of course under apprehensions of invasion preceding war they are not one nation for the purpose most of all requiring it and that the public safety may have no other resource than in those large and permanent military establishments which are forbden by the principles of our free government and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.On the coasts and on the ocean the war has been as successful as circumstances inseparable from its early stages could promise. Our public ships and private cruisers by their activity and where there was occasion by their intrepity have made the enemy sensible of the difference between a reciprocity of captures and the long confinement of them to their se. Our trade with little exception has safely reached our ports having been much favored in it by the course pursued by a squadron of our frigates under the command of Commodore Rodgers and in the instance in which skill and bravery were more particularly tried with those of the enemy the American flag had an auspicious triumph. The frigate Constitution commanded by Captain Hull after a close and short engagement completely disabled and captured a British frigate gaining for that officer and all on board a praise which can not be too liberally bestowed not merely for the victory actually achieved but for that prompt and cool exertion of commanding talents which giving to courage its highest character and to the force applied its full effect proved that more could have been done in a contest requiring more.Anxious to abrge the evils from which a state of war can not be exempt I lost no time after it was declared in conveying to the British Government the terms on which its progress might be arrested without awaiting the delays of a formal and final pacification and our charge' d'affaires at London was at the same time authorized to agree to an armistice founded upon them. These terms required that the orders in council should be repealed as they affected the United States without a revival of ades violating acknowledged rules and that there should be an immediate discharge of American sea men from British ships and a stop to impressment from American ships with an understanding that an exclusion of the sea men of each nation from the ships of the other should be stipulated and that the armistice should be improved into a definitive and comprehensive adjustment of depending controversies.Although a repeal of the orders susceptible of explanations meeting the s of this Government had taken place before this pacific advance was communicated to that of Great Britain the advance was declined from an avowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressments during the armistice and without any intimation that the arrangement proposed WRT sea men would be accepted. Whether the subsequent communications from this Government affording an occasion for reconsering the subject on the part of Great Britain will be ed in a more favorable light or received in a more accommodating spirit remains to be known. It would be unwise to relax our measures in any respect on a presumption of such a result.The documents from the Department of State which relate to this subject will give a  also of the propositions for an armistice which have been received here one of them from the authorities at Halifax and in Canada the other from the British Government itself through Admiral Warren and of the grounds on which neither of them could be accepted.Our affairs with France retain the posture which they held at my last communications to you. Notwithstanding the authorized expectations of an early as well as favorable issue to the discussions on foot these have been procrastinated to the latest date. The only intervening occurrence meriting attention is the promulgation of a French decree purporting to be a definitive repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees. This proceeding although made the ground of the repeal of the British orders in council is rendered by the time and manner of it liable to many objections.The final communications from our special minister to Denmark afford further proofs of the good effects of his mission and of the amicable disposition of the Danish Government. From Russia we have the satisfaction to receive assurances of continued friendship and that it will not be affected by the rupture between the United States and Great Britain. Sweden also professes sentiments favorable to the subsisting harmony.With the Barbary Powers excepting that of Algiers our affairs remain on the ordinary footing. The consulgeneral resing with that Regency has suddenly and without cause been banished together with all the American citizens found there. Whether this was the transitory effect of capricious despotism or the first act of predetermined hostility is not ascertained. Precautions were taken by the consul on the latter supposition.The Indian tribes not under foreign instigations remain at peace and receive the civilizing attentions which have proved so beneficial to them.With a  to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which our national faculties are adequate the attention of Congress will be particularly drawn to the insufficiency of existing provisions for filling up the military establishment. Such is the happy condition of our country arising from the facility of subsistence and the high wages for every species of occupation that notwithstanding the augmented inducements proved at the last session a partial success only has attended the recruiting service. The deficiency has been necessarily supplied during the campaign by other than regular troops with all the inconveniences and expense incent to them. The remedy lies in establishing more favorably for the private soldier the proportion between his recompense and the term of his enlistment and it is a subject which can not too soon or too seriously be taken into conseration.The same insufficiency has been experienced in the provisions for volunteers made by an act of the last session. The recompense for the service required in this case is still less attractive than in the other and although patriotism alone has sent into the field some valuable corps of that description those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be reasonably expected to yield to that impulse.It will merit conseration also whether as auxiliary to the security of our frontiers corps may not be advantageously organized with a restriction of their services to particular districts convenient to them and whether the local and occasional services of mariners and others in the sea port towns under a similar organization would not be a provent addition to the means of their defense.I recommend a provision for an increase of the general officers of the Army the deficiency of which has been illustrated by the # and distance of separate commands which the course of the war and the advantage of the service have required.And I can not press too strongly on the earliest attention of the Legislature the importance of the reorganization of the staff establishment with a  to render more distinct and definite the relations and responsibilities of its several departments. That there is room for improvements which will materially promote both economy and success in what appertains to the Army and the war is equally inculcated by the examples of other countries and by the experience of our own.A revision of the militia laws for the purpose of rendering them more systematic and better adapting them to emergencies of the war is at this time particularly desirable.Of the additional ships authorized to be fitted for service two will be shortly ready to sail a third is under repair and delay will be avoed in the repair of the resue. Of the appropriations for the purchase of materials for ship building the greater part has been applied to that object and the purchase will be continued with the balance.The enterprising spirit which has characterized our al force and its success both in restraining insults and depredations on our coasts and in reprisals on the enemy will not fail to recommend an enlargement of it.There being reason to believe that the act prohibiting the acceptance of British licenses is not a sufficient guard against the use of them for purposes favorable to the interests and s of the enemy further provisions on that subject are highly important. Nor is it less so that penal enactments should be proved for cases of corrupt and perfious intercourse with the enemy not amounting to treason nor yet embraced by any statutory provisions.A conserable number of American vessels which were in England when the revocation of the orders in council took place were laden with British manufactures under an erroneous impression that the nonimportation act would immediately cease to operate and have arrived in the United States. It d not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen cases of such magnitude the powers vested in the Treasury Department to mitigate forfeitures without previously affording to Congress an opportunity of making on the subject such provision as they may think proper. In their decision they will doubtless equally consult what is due to equitable conserations and to the public interest.The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last have exceeded $16.5M which have been sufficient to defray all the demands on the Treasury to that day including a necessary reimbursement of near $3M of the principal of the public debt. In these receipts is included a sum of near $5.85M received on account of the loans authorized by the acts of the last session; the whole sum actually obtained on loan amounts to $11M the resue of which being receivable subsequent to the 30th of September last will together with the current revenue enable us to defray all the expenses of this year.The duties on the late unexpected importations of British manufactures will render the revenue of the ensuing year more productive than could have been anticipated.The situation of our country fellow citizens is not without its difficulties though it abounds in animating conserations of which the  here presented of our pecuniary resources is an example. With more than one nation we have serious and unsettled controversies and with one powerful in the means and habits of war we are at war. The spirit and strength of the nation are nevertheless equal to the support of all its rights and to carry it through all its trials. They can be met in that confence.Above all we have the inestimable consolation of knowing that the war in which we are actually engaged is a war neither of ambition nor of vain glory; that it is waged not in violation of the rights of others but in the maintenance of our own; that it was preceded by a patience without example under wrongs accumulating without end and that it was finally not declared until every hope of averting it was extinguished by the transfer of the British scepter into new hands clinging to former councils and until declarations were reiterated to the last hour through the British envoy here that the hostile edicts against our commercial rights and our maritime independence would not be revoked; nay that they could not be revoked without violating the obligations of Great Britain to other powers as well as to her own interests.To have shrunk under such circumstances from manly resistance would have been a degradation blasting our best and proudest hopes; it would have struck us from the high rank where the virtuous struggles of our fathers had placed us and have betrayed the magnificent legacy which we hold in trust for future generations. It would have acknowledged that on the element which forms threefourth of the globe we inhabit and where all independent nations have equal and common rights the American people were not an independent people but colonists and vassals.It was at this moment and with such an alternative that war was chosen. The nation felt the necessity of it and called for it. The appeal was accordingly made in a just cause to the Just and Allpowerful Being who holds in His hand the chain of events and the destiny of nations.It remains only that faithful to ourselves entangled in no connections with the s of other powers and ever ready to accept peace from the hand of justice we prosecute the war with united counsels and with the ample faculties of the nation until peace be so obtained and as the only means under the Divine blessing of speedily obtaining it.
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: As the continuance of the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes will be under the conseration of the Legislature at its present session I think it my duty to communicate the s which have gued me in the execution of that act in order that you may dece on the policy of continuing it in the present or any other form or discontinue it altogether if that shall on the whole seem most for the public good.The Indian tribes resing within the limits of the United States have for a conserable time been growing more and more uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy although effected by their own voluntary sales and the policy has long been gaining strength with them of refusing absolutely all further sale on any conditions insomuch that at this time it hazards their friendship and excites dangerous jealousies and perturbations in their minds to make any overture for the purchase of the smallest portions of their land. A very few tribes only are not yet obstinately in these dispositions. In order peaceably to counteract this policy of theirs and to prove an extension of territory which the rap increase of our numbers will call for two measures are deemed expedient. First. To encourage them to abandon hunting to apply to the raising stock to agriculture and domestic manufacture and thereby prove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain them in this better than in their former mode of living. The extensive forests necessary in the hunting life will then become useless and they will see advantage in exchanging them for the means of improving their farms and of increasing their domestic comforts. Secondly. To multiply trading houses among them and place within their reach those things which will contribute more to their domestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated wilds. Experience and reflection will develop to them the wisdom of exchanging what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and they want. In leading them thus to agriculture to factures and civilization; in bringing together their and our sentiments and in preparing them ultimately to participate in the benefits of our Government I trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good. At these trading houses we have pursued the principles of the act of Congress which directs that the commerce shall be carried on liberally and requires only that the capital stock shall not be diminished. We consequently undersell private traders foreign and domestic drive them from the competition and thus with the good will of the Indians r ourselves of a description of men who are constantly endeavoring to excite in the Indian mind suspicions fears and irritations toward us. A letter now inclosed shows the effect of our competition on the operations of the traders while the Indians perceiving the advantage of purchasing from us are soliciting generally our establishment of trading houses among them. In one quarter this is particularly interesting. The Legislature reflecting on the late occurrences on the Mississippi must be sensible how desirable it is to possess a respectable breadth of country on that river from our southern limit to the Illinois at least so that we may present as firm a front on that as on our eastern border. We possess what is below the Yazoo and can probably acquire a certain breadth from the Illinois and Wabash to the Ohio; but between the Ohio and Yazoo the country all belongs to the Chickasaws the most friendly tribe within our limits but the most deced against the alienation of lands. The portion of their country most important for us is exactly that which they do not inhabit. Their settlements are not on the Mississippi but in the interior country. They have lately shown a desire to become agricultural and this leads to the desire of buying implements and comforts. In the strengthening and gratifying of these wants I see the only prospect of planting on the Mississippi itself the means of its own safety. Duty has required me to submit these s to the judgment of the Legislature but as their disclosure might embarrass and defeat their effect they are committed to the special confence of the two Houses.While the extension of the public commerce among the Indian tribes may deprive of that source of profit such of our citizens as are engaged in it it might be worthy the attention of Congress in their care of inual as well as of the general interest to point in another direction the enterprise of these citizens as profitably for themselves and more usefully for the public. The river Missouri and the Indians inhabiting it are not as well known as is rendered desirable by their connection with the Mississippi and consequently with us. It is however understood that the country on that river is inhabited by numerous tribes who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation carried on in a high latitude through an infinite number of portages and lakes shut up by ice through a long season. The commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of the Missouri traversing a moderate climate offering according to the best accounts a continued igation from its source and possibly with a single portage from the Western Ocean and finding to the Atlantic a choice of channels through the Illinois or Wabash the Lakes and Hudson through the Ohio and Susquehanna or Potomac or James rivers and through the Tennessee and Savannah rivers. An intelligent officer with ten or twelve chosen men fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it taken from our posts where they may be spared without inconvenience might explore the whole line even to the Western Ocean have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial intercourse get admission among them for our traders as others are admitted agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles and return with the information acquired in the course of two summers. Their arms and accouterments some instruments of observation and light and cheap presents for the Indians would be all the apparatus they could carry and with an expectation of a soldier's portion of land on their return would constitute the whole expense. Their pay would be going on whether here or there. While other civilized nations have encountered great expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking voyages of discovery and for other literary purposes in various parts and directions our nation seems to owe to the same object as well as to its own interests to explore this the only line of easy communication across the continent and so directly traversing our own part of it. The interests of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional powers and care of Congress and that it should incentally advance the geographical knowledge of our own continent can not but be an additional gratification. The nation claiming the territory regarding this as a literary pursuit which it is in the habit of permitting within its dominions would not be disposed to  it with jealousy even if the expiring state of its interests there d not render it a matter of indifference. The appropriation of $2 500 for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States while understood and consered by the Executive as giving the legislative sanction would cover the undertaking from notice and prevent the obstructions which interested inuals might otherwise previously prepare in its way.TH: JEFFERSON.
To Meriwether Lewis esq. Capt. of the 1st regimt. of infantry of the U. S. of A.:Your situation as Secretary of the Present of the U. S. has made you acquainted with the objects of my confential message of Jan. 18 1803 to the legislature; you have seen the act they passed which tho' expressed in general terms was meant to sanction those objects and you are appointed to carry them into execution. Instruments for ascertaining by celestial observations the geography of the country through which you will pass have been already proved. Light articles for barter and presents among the Indians arms for your attendants say for from 10. to 12. men boats tents &amp; other travelling apparatus with ammunition medecine surgical instruments and provisions you will have prepared with such as as the Secretary at War can yield in his department; &amp; from him also you will recieve authority to engage among our troops by voluntary agreement the number of attendants above mentioned over whom you as their commanding officer are invested with all the powers the laws give in such a case.As your movements while within the limits of the U.S. will be better directed by occasional communications adapted to circumstances as they arise they will not be noticed here. What follows will respect your proceedings after your departure from the United states.Your mission has been communicated to the ministers here from France Spain &amp; Great Britain and through them to their governments; &amp; such assurances given them as to its objects as we trust will satisfy them. The country [of Louisiana] having been ceded by Spain to France the passport you have from the minister of France the representative of the present sovereign of the country will be a protection with all its subjects; &amp; that from the minister of England will entitle you to the friendly a of any traders of that allegiance with whom you may happen to meet. The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river &amp; such principal stream of it as by it's course &amp; communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean whether the Columbia Oregan Colorado or and other river may offer the most direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent for the purposes of commerce. Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri you will take careful observations of latitude &amp; longitude at all remarkeable points on the river &amp; especially at the mouths of rivers at raps at islands &amp; other places &amp; objects distinguished by such natural marks &amp; characters of a durable kind as that they may with certainty be recognised hereafter. The courses of the river between these points of observation may be supplied by the compass the logline &amp; by time corrected by the observations themselves. The variations of the compass too in different places should be noticed.The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri &amp; of the water offering the best communication with the Pacific ocean should also be fixed by observation &amp; the course of that water to the ocean in the same manner as that of the Missouri. Your observations are to be taken with great pains &amp; accuracy to be entered distinctly &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself to comprehend all the elements necessary with the a of the usual tables to fix the latitude and longitude of the places at which they were taken and are to be rendered to the waroffice for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently by proper persons within the U.S. Several copies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at leisure times &amp; put into the care of the most trustworthy of your attendants to guard by multiplying them against the accental losses to which they will be exposed. A further guard would be that one of these copies be on the paper of the birch as less liable to injury from damp than common paper. The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will pursue renders a knolege of those people important. You will therefore endeavor to make yourself acquainted as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit with the names of the nations &amp; their numbers;the extent &amp; limits of their possessions; their relations with other tribes of nations; their language traditions monuments their ordinary occupations in agriculture fishing hunting war arts &amp; the implements for these; their food clothing &amp; domestic accommodations; the diseases prevalent among them &amp; the remedies they use; moral &amp; physical circumstances which distinguish them from the tribes we know; peculiarities in their laws customs &amp; dispositions; and articles of commerce they may need or furnish &amp; to what extent. And consering the interest which every nation has in extending &amp; strengthening the authority of reason &amp; justice among the people around them it will be useful to acquire what knolege you can of the state of morality religion &amp; information among them; as it may better enable those who endeavor to civilize &amp; instruct them to adapt their measure to the existing notions &amp; practices of those on whom they are to operate.Other objects worthy of notice will be the soil &amp; face of the country it's growth &amp; vegetable productions especially those not of the U.S. the animals of the country generally &amp; especially those not known in the U.S. the remains or accounts of any which may be deemed rare or extinct; the mineral productions of every kind; but more particularly metals limestone pit coal &amp; saltpetre; salines &amp; mineral waters noting the temperature of the last &amp; such circumstances as may indicate their character; volcanic appearances; climate as characterized by the thermometer by the proportion of rainy cloudy &amp; clear days by lightening hail snow ice by the access &amp; recess of frost by the winds prevailing at different seasons the dates at which particular plants put forth or lose their flower or leaf times of appearance of particular birds reptiles or insects. Altho' your route will be along the channel of the Missouri yet you will endeavor to inform yourself by enquiry of the character &amp; extent of the country watered by it's branches &amp; especially on it's Southern se. The North river or Rio Bravo which runs into the gulph of Mexico and the North river or Rio colorado which runs into the gulph of California are understood to be the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of the Missouri and running Southwardly. Whether the ing grounds between the Missouri &amp; them are mountains or flatlands what are their distance from the Missouri the character of the intermediate country &amp; the people inhabiting it are worthy of particular enquiry. The Northern waters of the Missouri are less to be enquired after becaue they have been ascertained to a conserable degree &amp; are still in a course of ascertainment by English traders and travellers. But if you can learn any thing certain of the most Northern source of the Missisipi &amp; of its position relatively to the lake of the woods it will be interesting to us. Some account too of the path of the Canadian traders from the Missisipi at the mouth of the Ouisconsin to where it strikes the Missouri &amp; of the soil and rivers in it's course is desireable.In all your intercourse with the natives treat them in the most friendly &amp; conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit; allay all jealousies as to the object of your journey satisfy them of its innocence make them acquainted with the position extent character peaceable &amp; commercial dispositions of the U.S. of our wish to be neighborly friendly &amp; useful to them &amp; of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them; confer with them on the points most convenient as mutual emporiums and the articles of most desireable interchange for them &amp; us. If a few of their influential chiefs within practicable distance wish to visit us arrange such a visit with them and furnish them with authority to call on our officers on their entering the U.S to have them conveyed to this place at the public expense. If any of them should wish to have some of their young people brought up with us &amp; taught such arts as may be useful to them we will receive instruct &amp; take care of them. Such a mission whether of influential chiefs or of young people would give some security to your own party. Carry with you some matter of the kinepox; inform those of them with whom you may be of it'[s] efficacy as a preservative from the smallpox; &amp; instruct &amp; incourage them in the use of it. This may be especially done wherever you winter. As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will be recieved by those people whether with hospitality or hostility so is it impossible to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance with which you are to pursue your journey. We value too much the lives of citizens to offer them to probable destruction. Your numbers will be sufficient to secure you against the unauthorised opposition of inuals or of small parties: but if a superior force authorised or not authorised by a nation should be arrayed against your further passage and inflexibly determined to arrest it you must decline its further pursuit and return. In the loss of yourselves we should lose also the information you will have acquired. By returning safely with that you may enable us to renew the essay with better calculated means. To your own discretion therefore must be left the degree of danger you may risk and the point at which you should decline only saying we wish you to err on the se of your safety and to bring back your party safe even it if be with less information.As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend an intercourse will probably be found to exist between them &amp; the Spanish post of St. Louis opposite Cahokia or Ste. Genevieve opposite Kaskaskia. From still further up the river the traders may furnish a conveyance for letters. Beyond that you may perhaps be able to engage Indian to bring letters for the government to Cahokia or Kaskaskia on promising that they shall there receive such special compensation as you shall have stipulated with them. Avail yourself of these means to communicate to us at seasonable intervals a copy of your journal notes &amp; observations of every kind putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed. Should you reach the Pacific ocean inform yourself of the circumstances which may dece whether the furs of those parts may not be collected as advantageously at the head of the Missouri (convenient as it supposed to the waters of the Colorado &amp; Oregan or Columbia) as at Nootka sound or any other point of that coast; and that trade be consequently conducted through the Missouri &amp; U.S. more beneficially than by the circumigation now practised. On your arrival on that coast endeavor to learn if there be any port within your reach frequented by the seavessels of any nation &amp; to send two of your trusty people back by sea in such way as shall appear practicable with a copy of your notes: and should you be of opinion that the return of your party by the way they went will be eminently dangerous then ship the whole &amp; return by sea by way either of cape Horn or the cape of good Hope as you shall be able. As you will be without money clothes or provisions you must endeavor to use the credit of the U.S. to obtain them for which purpose open letters of credit shall be furnished you authorising you to draw upon the Executive of the U.S. or any of its officers in any part of the world on which draughts can be disposed of &amp; to apply with our recommendations to the Consuls agents merchants or citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse assuring them in our name that any as they may furnish you shall be honorably repa and on demand. Our consuls Thomas Hewes at Batavia in Java Win. Buchanan in the Isles of France &amp; Bourbon &amp; John Elmslie at the Cape of good Hope will be able to supply your necessities by draughts on us.Should you find it safe to return by the way you go after sending two of your party around by sea or with your whole party if no conveyance by sea can be found do so; making such observations on your return as may serve to supply correct or confirm those made on your outward journey. On reentering the U.S. and reaching a place of safety discharge any of your attendants who may desire &amp; deserve it procuring for them immediate paiment of all arrears of pay &amp; cloathing which may have incurred since their departure and assure them that they shall be recommended to the liberality of the legislature for the grant of a souldier's portion of land each as proposed in my message to Congress: &amp; repair yourself with papers to the seat of government.To prove on the accent of your death against anarchy dispersion &amp; the consequent danger to your party and total failure of the enterprize you are hereby authorised by any instrument signed &amp; written in your own hand to name the person among them who shall succeed to the command on your decease and by like instruments to change the nomination from time to time as further experience of the characters accompanying you shall point out superior fitness: and all the powers and authorities given to yourself are in the event of your death transferred to &amp; vested in the successor so named with further power to him and his successors in like manner to name each his successor who on the death of his predecessor shall be invested with all the powers &amp; authorities given to yourself.< Given under my hand at the city of Washington this 20th day of June 1803. Th. Jefferson< Pr. U.S. of America<
Fellow Citizens of the Senate &amp; of the House of Representatives:Notwithstanding the early day which had been fixed for your session of the present year I was induced to call you together still sooner as well that any inadequacy in the existing provisions for the wants of the Treasury might be supplied as that no delay might happen in proving for the result of the negotiations on foot with Great Britain whether it should require arrangements adapted to a return of peace or further and more effective provisions for prosecuting the war. That result is not yet known. If on the one hand the repeal of the orders in council and the general pacification in Europe which withdrew the occasion on which impressments from American vessels were practiced suggest expectations that peace and amity may be reestablished we are compelled on the other hand by the refusal of the British Government to accept the offered mediation of the Emperor of Russia by the delays in giving effect to its own proposal of a direct negotiation and above all by the principles and manner in which the war is now avowedly carried on to infer that a spirit of hostility is indulged more violent than ever against the rights and prosperity of this country. This increased violence is best explained by the two important circumstances that the great contest in Europe for an equilibrium guaranteeing all its States against the ambition of any has been closed without any check on the overbearing power of Great Britain on the ocean and it has left in her hands disposable armaments with which forgetting the difficulties of a remote war with a free people and yielding to the intoxication of success with the example of a great victim to it before her eyes she cherishes hopes of still further aggrandizing a power already formable in its abuses to the tranquillity of the civilized and commercial world. But whatever may have inspired the enemy with these more violent purposes the public councils of a nation more able to maintain than it was to require its independence and with a devotion to it rendered more ardently by the experience of its blessings can never deliberate but on the means most effectual for defeating the extravagant s or unwarrantable passions with which alone the war can now be pursued against us. In the events of the present campaign the enemy with all his augmented means and wanton use of them has little ground for exultation unless he can feel it in the success of his recent enterprises against this metropolis and the neighboring town of Alexandria from both of which his retreats were as precipitate as his attempts were bold and fortunate. In his other incursions on our Atlantic frontier his progress often checked and chastised by the martial spirit of the neighboring citizens has had more effect in distressing inuals and in dishonoring his arms than in promoting any object of legitimate warfare; and in the two instances mentioned however deeply to be regretted on our part he will find in his transient success which interrupted for a moment only the ordinary business at the seat of Government no compensation for the loss of character with the world by his violations of private property and by his destruction of public edifices protected as monuments of the arts by the laws of civilized warfare. On our se we can appeal to a series of achievements which have given new luster to the American arms. Beses the brilliant incents in the minor operations of the campaign the splend victories gained on the Canadian se of the Niagara by the American forces under MajorGeneral Brown and Brigadiers Scott and Gaines have gained for these heroes and their emulating companions the most unfading laurels and having triumphantly tested the progressive discipline of the American soldiery have taught the enemy that the longer he protracts his hostile efforts the more certain and decisive will be his final discomfiture. On our southern border victory has continued also to follow the American standard. The bold and skillful operations of MajorGeneral Jackson conducting troops drawn from the militia of the States least distant particularly Tennessee have subdued the principal tribes of hostile savages and by establishing a peace with them preceded by recent and exemplary chastisement has best guarded against the mischief of their cooperations with the British enterprises which may be planned against that quarter of our country. Important tribes of Indians on our northwestern frontier have also acceded to stipulations which bind them to the interests of the United States and to conser our enemy as theirs also. In the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of Baltimore defended by militia and volunteers aed by a small body of regulars and sea men he was received with a spirit which produced a rap retreat to his ships whilst concurrent attack by a large fleet was successfully resisted by the steady and welldirected fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it. In another recent attack by a powerful force on our troops at Plattsburg of which regulars made a part only the enemy after a perseverance for many hours was finally compelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat with our gallant bands pressing upon them. On the Lakes so much contested throughout the war the great exertions for the command made on our part have been well repa. On Lake Ontario our squadron is now and has been for some time in a condition to confine that of the enemy to his own port and to favor the operations of our land forces on that frontier. A part of the squadron on Lake Erie has been extended into Lake Huron and has produced the advantage of displaying our command on that lake also. One object of the expedition was the reduction of Mackinaw which filed with the loss of a few brave men among whom was an officer justly distinguished for his gallant exploits. The expedition ably conducted by both the land and the al commanders was otherwise highly valuable in its effects. On Lake Champlain where our superiority had for some time been undisputed the British squadron lately came into action with the American commanded by Captain Macdonough. It issued in the capture of the whole of the enemy's ships. The best praise for this officer and his intrep comrades is in the likeness of his triumph to the illustrious victory which immortalized another officer and established at a critical moment our command of another lake. On the ocean the pre of our al arms had been amply supported. A second frigate has indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy but the loss is hden in the blaze of heroism with which she was defended. Captain Porter who commanded her and whose previous career had been distinguished by daring enterprise and by fertility of genius maintained a sanguinary contest against two ships one of them superior to his own and under other severe disadvantages 'til humanity tore down the colors which valor had nailed to the mast. This officer and his brave comrades have added much to the rising glory of the American flag and have merited all the effusions of gratitude which their country is ever ready to bestow on the champions of its rights and of its safety. Two smaller vessels of war have also become prizes to the enemy but by a superiority of force which sufficiently vindicates the reputation of their commanders whilst two others one commanded by Captain Warrington the other by Captain Blakely have captured British ships of the same  with a gallantry and good conduct which entitle them and their companions to a just share in the praise of their country. In spite of the al force of the enemy accumulated on our coasts our private cruisers also have not ceased to annoy his commerce and to bring their rich prizes into our ports contributing thus with other proofs to demonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a ade the proclamation of which is made the pretext for vexing and discouraging the commerce of neutral powers with the United States. To meet the extended and ersified warfare adopted by the enemy great bodies of militia have been taken into service for the public defense and great expenses incurred. That the defense everywhere may be both more convenient and more economical Congress will see the necessity of immediate measures for filling the ranks of the Regular Army and of enlarging the provision for special corps mounted and unmounted to be engaged for longer periods of service than are due from the militia. I earnestly renew at the same time a recommendation of such changes in the system of the militia as by ing and disciplining for the most prompt and active service the portions most capable of it will give to that great resource for the public safety all the requisite energy and efficiency. The moneys received into the Treasury during the nine months ending on the 30th day of June last amounted to $32M of which near $11M were the proceeds of the public revenue and the remainder derived from loans. The disbursements for public expenditures during the same period exceeded $34M and left in the Treasury on the first day of July near $5M. The demands during the remainder of the present year already authorized by Congress and the expenses incent to an extension of the operations of the war will render it necessary that large sums should be proved to meet them. From this  of the national affairs Congress will be urged to take up without delay as well the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of military force and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the character which the war has assumed. It is not to be disguised that the situation of our country calls for its greatest efforts. Our enemy is powerful in men and in money on the land and on the water. Availing himself of fortuitous advantages he is aiming with his uned force a deadly blow at our growing prosperity perhaps at our national existence. has avowed his purpose of trampling on the usages of civilized warfare and given earnests of it in the plunder and wanton destruction of private property. In his pre of maritime dominion and in his thirst of commercial monopoly he strikes with peculiar animosity at the progress of our igation and of our manufactures. His barbarous policy has not even spared those monuments of the arts and models of taste with which our country had enriched and embellished its infant metropolis. From such an adversary hostility in its greatest force and in its worst forms may be looked for. The American people will face it with the undaunted spirit which in their revolutionary struggle defeated his unrighteous projects. His threats and his barbarities instead of dismay will kindle in every bosom an indignation not be extinguished but in the disaster and expulsion of such cruel invaders. In proving the means necessary the National Legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlightened patriotism of its constituents. They will cheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind which the safety and honor of the nation demand. We have seen them everywhere paying their taxes direct and indirect with the greatest promptness and alacrity. We see them rushing with enthusiasm to the scenes where danger and duty call. In offering their blood they give the surest pledge that no other tribute will be withheld. Having forborne to declare war until to other aggressions had been added the capture of near 1000 American vessels and the impressment of thousands of American sea faring citizens and until a final declaration had been made by the Government of Great Britain that her hostile orders against our commerce would not be revoked but on conditions as impossible as unjust whilst it was known that these orders would not otherwise cease but with a war which had lasted nearly twenty years and which according to appearances at that time might last as many more; having manifested on every occasion and in every proper mode a sincere desire to arrest the effusion of blood and meet our enemy on the ground of justice and reconciliation our beloved country in still opposing to his persevering hostility all its energies with an undiminished disposition toward peace and friendship on honorable terms must carry with it the good wishes of the impartial world and the best hopes of support from an omnipotent and kind Provence. 
Whereas information has been received that sundry persons citizens of the United States or resents within the same are conspiring and confederating together to begin and set on foot prove and prepare the means for a military expedition or enterprise against the dominions of Spain; that for this purpose they are fitting out and arming vessels in the western waters of the United States collecting provisions arms military stores and means; are deceiving and seducing honest and wellmeaning citizens under various pretenses to engage in their criminal enterprises; are organizing officering and arming themselves for the same contrary to the laws in such cases made and proved:I have therefore thought proper to issue this my proclamation warning and enjoining all faithful citizens who have been led without due knowledge or conseration to participate in the sa unlawful enterprises to withdraw from the same without delay and commanding all persons whatsoever engaged or concerned in the same to cease all further proceedings therein as they will answer the contrary at their peril and incur prosecution with all the rigors of the law.

 FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  It is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me that on meeting the great council of our nation I am able to announce to them on the grounds of reasonable certainty that the wars and troubles which have for so many years afflicted our sister nations have at length come to an end and that the communications of peace and commerce are once more opening among them. While we devoutly return thanks to the beneficent Being who has been pleased to breathe into them the spirit of conciliation and forgiveness we are bound with peculiar gratitude to be thankful to him that our own peace has been preserved through so perilous a season and ourselves permitted quietly to cultivate the earth and to practice and improve those arts which tend to increase our comforts. The assurances indeed of friendly disposition received from all the powers with whom we have principal relations had inspired a confence that our peace with them would not have been disturbed. But a cessation of the irregularities which had effected the commerce of neutral nations and of the irritations and injuries produced by them cannot but add to this confence; and strengthens at the same time the hope that wrongs committed on offending friends under a pressure of circumstances will now be reed with candor and will be consered as founding just claims of retribution for the past and new assurances for the future. Among our Indian neighbors also a spirit of peace and friendship generally prevailing and I am happy to inform you that the continued efforts to introduce among them the implements and the practice of husbandry and of the household arts have not been without success; that they are becoming more and more sensible of the superiority of this dependence for clothing and subsistence over the precarious resources of hunting and fishing; and already we are able to announce that instead of that constant diminution of their numbers produced by their wars and their wants some of them begin to experience an increase of population.To this state of general peace with which we have been blessed one only exception exists. Tripoli the least conserable of the Barbary States had come forward with demands unfounded either in right or in compact and had permitted itself to denounce war on our failure to comply before a given day. The  of the demand admitted but one answer. I sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean with assurances to that power of our sincere desire to remain in peace but with orders to protect our commerce against the threatened attack. The measure was seasonable and salutary. The bey had already declared war in form. His cruisers were out. Two had arrived at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the Mediterranean was aded and that of the Atlantic in peril. The arrival of our squadron dispelled the danger. One of the Tripolitan cruisers having fallen in with and engaged the small schooner Enterprise commanded by Lieutenant Sterret which had gone as a tender to our larger vessels was captured after a heavy slaughter of her men without the loss of a single one on our part. The bravery exhibited by our citizens on that element will I trust be a testimony to the world that it is not the want of that virtue which makes us seek their peace but a conscientious desire to direct the energies of our nation to the multiplication of the human race and not to its destruction. Unauthorized by the constitution without the sanction of Congress to go out beyond the line of defence the vessel being disabled from committing further hostilities was liberated with its crew. The legislature will doubtless conser whether by authorizing measures of offence also they will place our force on an equal footing with that of its adversaries. I communicate all material information on this subject that in the exercise of the important  consered by the constitution to the legislature exclusively their judgment may form itself on a knowledge and conseration of every circumstance of weight.I wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary states was entirely satisfactory. Discovering that some delays had taken place in the performance of certain articles stipulated by us I thought it my duty by immediate measures for fulfilling them to vindicate to ourselves the right of consering the effect of departure from stipulation on their se. From the papers which will be la before you you will be enabled to judge whether our treaties are regarded by them as fixing at all the measure of their demands or as guarding from the exercise of force our vessels within their power; and to conser how far it will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in their present posture.I lay before you the result of the census lately taken of our inhabitants to a conformity with which we are to reduce the ensuing rates of representation and taxation. You will perceive that the increase of numbers during the last ten years proceeding in geometrical ratio promises a duplication in little more than twentytwo years. We con this rap growth and the prospect it holds up to us not with a  to the injuries it may enable us to do to others in some future day but to the settlement of the extensive country still remaining vacant within our limits to the multiplications of men susceptible of happiness educated in the love of order habituated to selfgovernment and value its blessings above all price.Other circumstances combined with the increase of numbers have produced an augmentation of revenue arising from consumption in a ratio far beyond that of population alone and though the changes of foreign relations now taking place so desirably for the world may for a season affect this branch of revenue yet weighing all probabilities of expense as well as of income there is reasonable ground of confence that we may now safely dispense with all the internal taxes comprehending excises stamps auctions licenses carriages and refined sugars to which the postage on newspapers may be added to facilitate the progress of information and that the remaining sources of revenue will be sufficient to prove for the support of government to pay the interest on the public debts and to discharge the principals in shorter periods than the laws or the general expectations had cond. War indeed and untoward events may change this prospect of things and call for expenses which the imposts could not meet; but sound principles will not justify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not when and which might not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered by that treasure.These s however of reducing our burdens are formed on the expectation that a sensible and at the same time a salutary reduction may take place in our habitual expenditures. For this purpose those of the civil government the army and y will need revisal.When we conser that this government is charged with the external and mutual relations only of these states; that the states themselves have principal care of our persons our property and our reputation constituting the great field of human concerns we may well doubt whether our organization is not too complicated too expensive; whether offices or officers have not been multiplied unnecessarily and sometimes injuriously to the service they were meant to promote. I will cause to be la before you an essay toward a statement of those who under public employment of various kinds draw money from the treasury or from our citizens. Time has not permitted a perfect enumeration the ramifications of office being too multipled and remote to be completely traced in a first trial. Among those who are dependent on executive discretion I have begun the reduction of what was deemed necessary. The expenses of diplomatic agency have been conserably diminished. The inspectors of internal revenue who were found to obstruct the accountability of the institution have been discontinued. Several agencies created by executive authority on salaries fixed by that also have been suppressed and should suggest the expediency of regulating that power by law so as to subject its exercises to legislative inspection and sanction. Other reformations of the same kind will be pursued with that caution which is requisite in removing useless things not to injure what is retained. But the great mass of public offices is established by law and therefore by law alone can be abolished. Should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in re and try all its parts by the test of public utility they may be assured of every a and light which executive information can yield. Consering the general tendency to multiply offices and dependencies and to increase expense to the ultimate term of burden which the citizen can bear it behooves us to avail ourselves of every occasion which presents itself for taking off the surcharge; that it may never be seen here that after leaving to labor the smallest portion of its earnings on which it can subsist government shall itself consume the resue of what it was instituted to guard.In our care too of the public contributions intrusted to our direction it would be prudent to multiply barriers against their dissipation by appropriating specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible of definition; by disallowing applications of money varying from the appropriation in object or transcending it in amount; by reducing the undefined field of contingencies and thereby circumscribing discretionary powers over money; and by bringing back to a single department all accountabilities for money where the examination may be prompt efficacious and uniform.An account of the receipts and expenditures of the last year as prepared by the secretary of the treasury will as usual be la before you. The success which has attended the late sales of the public lands shows that with attention they may be made an important source of receipt. Among the payments those made in discharge of the principal and interest of the national debt will show that the public faith has been exactly maintained. To these will be added an estimate of appropriations necessary for the ensuing year. This last will of course be effected by such modifications of the systems of expense as you shall think proper to adopt.A statement has been formed by the secretary of war on mature conseration of all the posts and stations where garrisons will be expedient and of the number of men requisite for each garrison. The whole amount is conserably short of the present military establishment. For the surplus no particular use can be pointed out. For defence against invasion their number is as nothing; nor is it conceived needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up in time of peace for that purpose. Uncertain as we must ever be of the particular point in our circumference where an enemy may choose to invade us the only force which can be ready at every point and competent to oppose them is the body of neighboring citizens as formed into a militia. On these collected from the parts most convenient in numbers proportioned to the invading foe it is best to rely not only to meet the first attack but if it threatens to be permanent to maintain the defence until regulars may be engaged to relieve them. These conserations render it important that we should at every session continue to amend the defects which from time to time show themselves in the laws for regulating the militia until they are sufficiently perfect. Nor should we now or at any time separate until we can say we have done everything for the militia which we could do were an enemy at our door.The provisions of military stores on hand will be la before you that you may judge of the additions still requisite.With respect to the extent to which our al preparations should be carried some difference of opinion may be expected to appear; but just attention to the circumstances of every part of the Union will doubtless reconcile all. A small force will probably continue to be wanted for actual service in the Mediterranean. Whatever annual sum beyond that you may think proper to appropriate to al preparations would perhaps be better employed in proving those articles which may be kept without waste or consumption and be in readiness when any exigence calls them into use. Progress has been made as will appear by papers now communicated in proving materials for seventyfour gun ships as directed by law.How far the authority given by the legislature for procuring and establishing sites for al purposes has been perfectly understood and pursued in the execution admits of some doubt. A statement of the expenses already incurred on that subject shall be la before you. I have in certain cases suspended or slackened these expenditures that the legislature might determine whether so many yards are necessary as have been cond. The works at this place are among those permitted to go on; and five of the seven frigates directed to be la up have been brought and la up here where beses the safety of their position they are under the eye of the executive administration as well as of its agents and where yourselves also will be gued by your own  in the legislative provisions respecting them which may from time to time be necessary. They are preserved in such condition as well the vessels as whatever belongs to them as to be at all times ready for sea on a short warning. Two others are yet to be la up so soon as they shall have reserved the repairs requisite to put them also into sound condition. As a superintending officer will be necessary at each yard his duties and emoluments hitherto fixed by the executive will be a more proper subject for legislation. A communication will also be made of our progress in the execution of the law respecting the vessels directed to be sold.The fortifications of our harbors more or less advanced present conserations of great difficulty. While some of them are on a scale sufficiently proportioned to the advantages of their position to the efficacy of their protection and the importance of the points within it others are so extensive will cost so much in their first erection so much in their maintenance and require such a force to garrison them as to make it questionable what is best now to be done. A statement of those commenced or projected of the expenses already incurred and estimates of their future cost so far as can be foreseen shall be la before you that you may be enabled to judge whether any attention is necessary in the laws respecting this subject.Agriculture manufactures commerce and igation the four pillars of our prosperity are the most thriving when left most free to inual enterprise. Protection from casual embarrassments however may sometimes be seasonably interposed. If in the course of your observations or inquiries they should appear to need any a within the limits of our constitutional powers your sense of their importance is a sufficient assurance they will occupy your attention. We cannot indeed but all feel an anxious solicitude for the difficulties under which our carrying trade will soon be placed. How far it can be relieved otherwise than by time is a subject of important conseration.The judiciary system of the United States and especially that portion of it recently erected will of course present itself to the contemplation of Congress: and that they may be able to judge of the proportion which the institution bears to the business it has to perform I have caused to be procured from the several States and now lay before Congress an exact statement of all the causes deced since the first establishment of the courts and of those which were depending when additional courts and judges were brought in to their a.And while on the judiciary organization it will be worthy your conseration whether the protection of the inestimable institution of juries has been extended to all the cases involving the security of our persons and property. Their impartial selection also being essential to their value we ought further to conser whether that is sufficiently secured in those States where they are named by a marshal depending on executive will or designated by the court or by officers dependent on them.I cannot omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the subject of naturalization. Consering the ordinary chances of human life a denial of citizenship under a resence of fourteen years is a denial to a great proportion of those who ask it and controls a policy pursued from their first settlement by many of these States and still believed of consequence to their prosperity. And shall we refuse the unhappy fugitives from distress that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land? Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? The constitution indeed has wisely proved that for admission to certain offices of important trust a resence shall be required sufficient to develop character and design. But might not the general character and capabilities of a citizen be safely communicated to every one manifesting a _bona fe_ purpose of embarking his life and fortunes permanently with us? with restrictions perhaps to guard against the fraudulent usurpation of our flag; an abuse which brings so much embarrassment and loss on the genuine citizen and so much danger to the nation of being involved in war that no endeavor should be spared to detect and suppress it.These fellow citizens are the matters respecting the state of the nation which I have thought of importance to be submitted to your conseration at this time. Some others of less moment or not yet ready for communication will be the subject of separate messages. I am happy in this opportunity of committing the arduous affairs of our government to the collected wisdom of the Union. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to inform as far as in my power the legislative judgment nor to carry that judgment into faithful execution. The prudence and temperance of your discussions will promote within your own walls that conciliation which so much befriends national conclusion; and by its example will encourage among our constituents that progress of opinion which is tending to unite them in object and in will. That all should be satisfied with any one order of things is not to be expected but I indulge the pleasing persuasion that the great body of our citizens will cordially concur in honest and disinterested efforts which have for their object to preserve the general and State governments in their constitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain peace abroad and order and obedience to the laws at home; to establish principles and practices of administration favorable to the security of liberty and prosperity and to reduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of government. <
Fellow citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:In taking a general survey of the concerns of our beloved country with reference to subjects interesting to the common welfare the first sentiment which impresses itself upon the mind is of gratitude to the Omnipotent Disposer of All Good for the continuance of the signal blessings of His provence and especially for that health which to an unusual extent has prevailed within our borders and for that abundance which in the vicissitudes of the seasons has been scattered with profusion over our land. Nor ought we less to ascribe to Him the glory that we are permitted to enjoy the bounties of His hand in peace and tranquillity—in peace with all the other nations of the earth in tranquillity among our selves. There has indeed rarely been a period in the history of civilized man in which the general condition of the Christian nations has been marked so extensively by peace and prosperity.Europe with a few partial and unhappy exceptions has enjoyed 10 years of peace during which all her governments what ever the theory of their constitutions may have been are successively taught to feel that the end of their institution is the happiness of the people and that the exercise of power among men can be justified only by the blessings it confers upon those over whom it is extended.During the same period our intercourse with all those nations has been pacific and friendly; it so continues. Since the close of your last session no material variation has occurred in our relations with any one of them. In the commercial and igation system of Great Britain important changes of municipal regulation have recently been sanctioned by acts of Parliament the effect of which upon the interests of other nations and particularly upon ours has not yet been fully developed. In the recent renewal of the diplomatic missions on both ses between the two governments assurances have been given and received of the continuance and increase of the mutual confence and cordiality by which the adjustment of many points of difference had already been effected and which affords the surest pledge for the ultimate satisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may hereafter arise.The policy of the United States in their commercial intercourse with other nations has always been of the most liberal character. In the mutual exchange of their respective productions they have abstained altogether from prohibitions; they have interdicted themselves the power of laying taxes upon exports and when ever they have favored their own shipping by special preferences or exclusive privileges in their own ports it has been only with a  to countervail similar favors and exclusions granted by the nations with whom we have been engaged in traffic to their own people or shipping and to the disadvantage of ours. Immediately after the close of the last war a proposal was fairly made by the act of Congress of 18150303 to all the maritime nations to lay ase the system of retaliating restrictions and exclusions and to place the shipping of both parties to the common trade on a footing of equality in respect to the duties of tonnage and impost. This offer was partially and successively accepted by Great Britain Sweden the Netherlands the Hanseatic cities Prussia Sardinia the Duke of Oldenburg and Russia. It was also adopted under certain modifications in our late commercial convention with France and by the act of Congress of 18240108 it has received a new confirmation with all the nations who had acceded to it and has been offered again to all those who are or may here after be willing to abe in reciprocity by it. But all these regulations whether established by treaty or by municipal enactments are still subject to one important restriction.The removal of discriminating duties of tonnage and of impost is limited to articles of the growth produce or manufacture of the country to which the vessel belongs or to such articles as are most usually first shipped from her ports. It will deserve the serious conseration of Congress whether even this remnant of restriction may not be safely abandoned and whether the general tender of equal competition made in the act of 18240108 may not be extended to include all articles of merchandise not prohibited of what country so ever they may be the produce or manufacture. Propositions of this effect have already been made to us by more than one European government and it is probable that if once established by legislation or compact with any distinguished maritime state it would recommend itself by the experience of its advantages to the general accession of all.The convention of commerce and igation between the United States and France concluded on 18220624 was in the understanding and intent of both parties as appears upon its face only a temporary arrangement of the points of difference between them of the most immediate and pressing urgency. It was limited in the first instance to two years from 18221001 but with a proviso that it should further continue in force 'til the conclusion of a general and definitive treaty of commerce unless terminated by a notice six months in advance of either of the parties to the other. Its operation so far as it extended has been mutually advantageous and it still continues in force by common consent. But it left unadjusted several objects of great interest to the citizens and subjects of both countries and particularly a mass of claims to conserable amount of citizens of the United States upon the government of France of indemnity for property taken or destroyed under circumstances of the most aggravated and outrageous character. In the long period during which continual and earnest appeals have been made to the equity and magnanimity of France in behalf of these claims their justice has not been as it could not be denied.It was hoped that the accession of a new Sovereign to the throne would have afforded a favorable opportunity for presenting them to the conseration of his government. They have been presented and urged hither to without effect. The repeated and earnest representations of our minister at the Court of France remain as yet even without an answer. Were the demands of nations upon the justice of each other susceptible of adjudication by the sentence of an impartial tribunal those to which I now refer would long since have been settled and adequate indemnity would have been obtained.There are large amounts of similar claims upon the Netherlands Naples and Denmark. For those upon Spain prior to 1819 indemnity was after many years of patient forbearance obtained; and those upon Sweden have been lately compromised by a private settlement in which the claimants themselves have acquiesced. The governments of Denmark and of Naples have been recently reminded of those yet existing against them nor will any of them be forgotten while a hope may be indulged of obtaining justice by the means within the constitutional power of the executive and without resorting to those means of selfredress which as well as the time circumstances and occasion which may require them are within the exclusive competency of the legislature.It is with great satisfaction that I am enabled to bear witness to the liberal spirit with which the Republic of Colombia has made satisfaction for wellestablished claims of a similar character and among the documents now communicated to Congress will be distinguished a treaty of commerce and igation with that Republic the ratifications of which have been exchanged since the last recess of the legislature. The negotiation of similar treaties with all of the independent South American states has been cond and may yet be accomplished. The basis of them all as proposed by the United States has been la in two principles—the one of entire and unqualified reciprocity the other the mutual obligation of the parties to place each other permanently upon the footing of the most favored nation. These principles are indeed indispensable to the effectual emancipation of the American hemisphere from the thralldom of colonizing monopolies and exclusions an event raply realizing in the progress of human affairs and which the resistance still opposed in certain parts of Europe to the acknowledgment of the Southern American republics as independent states will it is believed contribute more effectually to accomplish. The time has been and that not remote when some of those states might in their anxious desire to obtain a nominal recognition have accepted of a nominal independence clogged with burdensome conditions and exclusive commercial privileges granted to the nation from which they have separated to the disadvantage of all others. They are all now aware that such concessions to any European nation would be incompatible with that independence which they have declared and maintainedAmong the measures which have been suggested to them by the new relations with one another resulting from the recent changes in their condition is that of assembling at the Isthmus of Panama a congress at which each of them should be represented to deliberate upon objects important to the welfare of all. The republics of Colombia of Mexico and of Central America have already deputed plenipotentiaries to such a meeting and they have invited the United States to be also represented there by their ministers. The invitation has been accepted and ministers on the part of the United States will be commissioned to attend at those deliberations and to take part in them so far as may be compatible with that neutrality from which it is neither our intention nor the desire of the other American states that we should depart.The commissioners under the seventh article of the Treaty of Ghent have so nearly completed their arduous labors that by the report recently received from the agent on the part of the United States there is reason to expect that the commission will be closed at their next session appointed for May 22 of the ensuing year.The other commission appointed to ascertain the indemnities due for slaves carried away from the United States after the close of the late war have met with some difficulty which has delayed their progress in the inquiry. A reference has been made to the British government on the subject which it may be hoped will tend to hasten the decision of the commissioners or serve as a substitute for it.Among the powers specifically granted to Congress by the Constitution are those of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States and of proving for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the services of the United States. The magnitude and complexity of the interests affected by legislation upon these subjects may account for the fact that long and often as both of them have occupied the attention and animated the debates of Congress no systems have yet been devised for fulfilling to the satisfaction of the community the duties prescribed by these grants of power.To conciliate the claim of the inual citizen to the enjoyment of personal liberty with the effective obligation of private contracts is the difficult problem to be solved by a law of bankruptcy. These are objects of the deepest interest to society affecting all that is precious in the existence of multitudes of persons many of them in the es essentially dependent and helpless of the age requiring nurture and of the sex entitled to protection from the free agency of the parent and the husband. The organization of the militia is yet more indispensable to the liberties of the country. It is only by an effective militia that we can at once enjoy the repose of peace and b defiance to foreign aggression; it is by the militia that we are constituted an armed nation standing in perpetual panoply of defense in the presence of all the other nations of the earth. To this end it would be necessary if possible so to shape its organization as to give it a more united and active energy. There are laws establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States and for arming and equipping its whole body. But it is a body of dislocated members without the vigor of unity and having little of uniformity but the name. To infuse into this most important institution the power of which it is susceptible and to make it available for the defense of the Union at the shortest notice and at the smallest expense possible of time of life and of treasure are among the benefits to be expected from the persevering deliberations of Congress.Among the unequivocal indications of our national prosperity is the flourishing state of our finances. The revenues of the present year from all their principal sources will exceed the anticipations of the last. The balance in the Treasury on the first of January last was a little short of $2000000 exclusive of $2500000 being the moiety of the loan of $5000000 authorized by the act of 18240526. The receipts into the Treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of September exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan are estimated at $16500000 and it is expected that those of the current quarter will exceed $5000000 forming an aggregate of receipts of nearly $22000000 independent of the loan. The expenditures of the year will not exceed that sum more than $2000000. By those expenditures nearly $8000000 of the principal of the public debt that have been discharged.More than $1500000 has been devoted to the debt of gratitude to the warriors of the Revolution; a nearly equal sum to the construction of fortifications and the acquisition of ordnance and other permanent preparations of national defense; $500000 to the gradual increase of the Navy; an equal sum for purchases of territory from the Indians and payment of annuities to them; and upward of $1000000 for objects of internal improvement authorized by special acts of the last Congress. If we add to these $4000000 for payment of interest upon the public debt there remains a sum of $7000000 which have defrayed the whole expense of the administration of government in its legislative executive and judiciary departments including the support of the military and al establishments and all the occasional contingencies of a government coextensive with the Union.The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported since the commencement of the year is about $25500000 and that which will accrue during the current quarter is estimated at $5500000; from these $31000000 deducting the drawbacks estimated at less than $7000000 a sum exceeding $24000000 will constitute the revenue of the year and will exceed the whole expenditures of the year. The entire amount of the public debt remaining due on the first of January next will be short of $81000000.By an act of Congress of the 3rd of March last a loan of $12000000 was authorized at 4.5 percent or an exchange of stock to that amount of 4.5 percent for a stock of 6 percent to create a fund for extinguishing an equal amount of the public debt bearing an interest of 6 percent redeemable in 1826. An account of the measures taken to give effect to this act will be la before you by the Secretary of the Treasury. As the object which it had in  has been but partially accomplished it will be for the conseration of Congress whether the power with which it clothed the executive should not be renewed at an early day of the present session and under what modifications.The act of Congress of the 3rd of March last directing the Secretary of the Treasury to subscribe in the name and for the use of the United States for 1500 shares of the capital stock of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Company has been executed by the actual subscription for the amount specified; and such other measures have been adopted by that officer under the act as the fulfillment of its intentions requires. The latest accounts received of this important undertaking authorize the belief that it is in successful progress.The payments into the Treasury from the proceeds of the sales of the public lands during the present year were estimated at $1000000. The actual receipts of the first two quarters have fallen very little short of that sum; it is not expected that the second half of the year will be equally productive but the income of the year from that source may now be safely estimated at $1500000. The act of Congress of 18240518 to prove for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United States by the purchasers of public lands was limited in its operation of relief to the purchaser to the 10th of April last. Its effect at the end of the quarter during which it expired was to reduce that debt from $10000000 to $7000000 By the operation of similar prior laws of relief from and since that of 18210302 the debt had been reduced from upward of $22000000 to $10000000.It is exceedingly desirable that it should be extinguished altogether; and to facilitate that consummation I recommend to Congress the revival for one year more of the act of 18240518 with such provisional modification as may be necessary to guard the public interests against fraudulent practices in the resale of the relinquished land.The purchasers of public lands are among the most useful of our fellow citizens and since the system of sales for cash alone has been introduced great indulgence has been justly extended to those who had previously purchased upon credit. The debt which had been contracted under the credit sales had become unwieldy and its extinction was alike advantageous to the purchaser and to the public. Under the system of sales matured as it has been by experience and adapted to the exigencies of the times the lands will continue as they have become an abundant source of revenue; and when the pledge of them to the public creditor shall have been redeemed by the entire discharge of the national debt the swelling te of wealth with which they replenish the common Treasury may be made to reflow in unfailing streams of improvement from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.The condition of the various branches of the public service resorting from the Department of War and their administration during the current year will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents herewith communicated. The organization and discipline of the Army are effective and satisfactory. To counteract the prevalence of desertion among the troops it has been suggested to withhold from the men a small portion of their monthly pay until the period of their discharge; and some expedient appears to be necessary to preserve and maintain among the officers so much of the art of horsemanship as could scarcely fail to be found wanting on the possible sudden eruption of a war which should take us unproved with a single corps of cavalry.The Military Academy at West Point under the restrictions of a severe but paternal superintendence recommends itself more and more to the patronage of the nation and the numbers of meritorious officers which it forms and introduces to the public service furnishes the means of multiplying the undertakings of the public improvements to which their acquirements at that institution are peculiarly adapted. The school of artillery practice established at Fortress Monroe Hampton Virginia is well suited to the same purpose and may need the a of further legislative provision to the same end. The reports of the various officers at the head of the administrative branches of the military service connected with the quartering clothing subsistence health and pay of the Army exhibit the assuous vigilance of those officers in the performance of their respective duties and the faithful accountability which has pervaded every part of the system.Our relations with the numerous tribes of aboriginal natives of this country scattered over its extensive surface and so dependent even for their existence upon our power have been during the present year highly interesting. An act of Congress of 18240525 made an appropriation to defray the expenses of making treaties of trade and friendship with the Indian tribes beyond the Mississippi. An act of 18250303 authorized treaties to be made with the Indians for their consent to the making of a road from the frontier of Missouri to that of New Mexico and another act of the same date proved for defraying the expenses of holding treaties with the Sioux Chippeways Menomenees Sauks Foxes etc. for the purpose of establishing boundaries and promoting peace between sa tribes.The first and last objects of these acts have been accomplished and the second is yet in a process of execution. The treaties which since the last session of Congress have been concluded with the several tribes will be la before the Senate for their conseration conformably to the Constitution. They comprise large and valuable acquisitions of territory and they secure an adjustment of boundaries and give pledges of permanent peace between several tribes which had been long waging bloody wars against each other.On the 12th of February last a treaty was signed at the Indian Springs between commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and certain chiefs and inuals of the Creek Nation of Indians which was received at the seat of government only a very few days before the close of the last session of Congress and of the late administration. The advice and consent of the Senate was given to it on the 3rd of March too late for it to receive the ratification of the then Present of the United States; it was ratified on the 7th of March under the unsuspecting impression that it had been negotiated in good faith and in the confence inspired by the recommendation of the Senate. The subsequent transactions in relation to this treaty will form the subject of a separate communication.The appropriations made by Congress for public works as well in the construction of fortifications as for purposes of internal improvement so far as they have been expended have been faithfuly applied. Their progress has been delayed by the want of suitable officers for superintending them. An increase of both the corps of engineers military and topographical was recommended by my predecessor at the last session of Congress. The reasons upon which that recommendation was founded subsist in all their force and have acquired additional urgency since that time. The Military Academy at West Point will furnish from the cadets there officers well qualified for carrying this measure into effect.The Board of Engineers for Internal Improvement appointed for carrying into execution the act of Congress of 18240430 to procure the necessary surveys plans and estimates on the subject of roads and canals have been actively engaged in that service from the close of the last session of Congress. They have completed the surveys necessary for ascertaining the practicability of a canal from the Chesapeake Bay to the Ohio River and are preparing a full report on that subject which when completed will be la before you. The same observation is to be made with regard to the two other objects of national importance upon which the Board have been occupied namely the accomplishment of a national road from this city to New Orleans and the practicability of uniting the waters of Lake Memphramagog with Connecticut River and the improvement of the igation of that river. The surveys have been made and are nearly completed. The report may be expected at an early period during the present session of Congress.The acts of Congress of the last session relative to the surveying marking or laying out roads in the Territories of Flora Arkansas and Michigan from Missouri to Mexico and for the continuation of the Cumberland road are some of them fully executed and others in the process of execution. Those for completing or commencing fortifications have been delayed only so far as the Corps of Engineers has been inadequate to furnish officers for the necessary superintendence of the works. Under the act confirming the statutes of Virginia and Maryland incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company three commissioners on the part of the United States have been appointed for opening books and receiving subscriptions in concert with a like number of commissioners appointed on the part of each of those states. A meeting of the commissioners has been postponed to await the definitive report of the board of engineers.The lighthouses and monuments for the safety of our commerce and mariners the works for the security of Plymouth Beach and for the preservation of the islands in Boston Harbor have received the attention required by the laws relating to those objects respectively. The continuation of the Cumberland road the most important of them all after surmounting no inconserable difficulty in fixing upon the direction of the road has commenced under the most promising of auspices with the improvements of recent invention in the mode of construction and with advantage of a great reduction in the comparative cost of the work.The operation of the laws relating to the Revolutionary pensioners may deserve the renewed conseration of Congress. The act of 18180318 while it made provision for many meritorious and indigent citizens who had served in the War of Independence opened a door to numerous abuses and impositions. To remedy this the act of 18200501 exacted proofs of absolute indigence which many really in want were unable and all susceptible of that delicacy which is allied to many virtues must be deeply reluctant to give. The result has been that some among the least deserving have been retained and some in whom the requisites both of worth and want were combined have been stricken from the list. As the numbers of these venerable relics of an age gone by diminish; as the decays of body mind and estate of those that survive must in the common course of nature increase should not a more liberal portion of indulgence be dealt out to them? May not the want in most instances be inferred from the demand when the service can be proved and may not the last days of human infirmity be spared the mortification of purchasing a pittance of relief only by the exposure of its own necessities? I submit to Congress the expediency of proving for inual cases of this description by special enactment or of revising the act of 18200501 with a  to mitigate the rigor of its exclusions in favor of persons to whom charity now bestowed can scarcely discharge the debt of justice.The portion of the al force of the Union in actual service has been chiefly employed on three stations—the Mediterranean the coasts of South America bordering on the Pacific Ocean and the West Indies. An occasional cruiser has been sent to range along the African shores most polluted by the traffic of slaves; one armed vessel has been stationed on the coast of our eastern boundary to cruise along the fishing grounds in Hudsons Bay and on the coast of Labrador and the first service of a new frigate has been performed in restoring to his native soil and domestic enjoyments the veteran hero whose youthful blood and treasure had freely flowed in the cause of our country's independence and whose whole life has been a series of services and sacrifices to the improvement of his fellow men.The visit of General Lafayette alike honorable to himself and to our country closed as it had commenced with the most affecting testimonials of devoted attachment on his part and of unbounded gratitude of this people to him in return. It will form hereafter a pleasing incent in the annals of our Union giving to real history the intense interest of romance and signally marking the unpurchasable tribute of a great nation's social affections to the disinterested champion of the liberties of humankind.The constant maintenance of a small squadron in the Mediterranean is a necessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of paying tribute for the security of our commerce in that sea and for a precarious peace at the mercy of every caprice of four Barbary states by whom it was liable to be violated. An additional motive for keeping a respectable force stationed there at this time is found in the maritime war raging between the Greeks and the Turks and in which the neutral igation of this Union is always in danger of outrage and depredation. A few instances have occurred of such depredations upon our merchant vessels by privateers or pirates wearing the Grecian flag but without real authority from the Greek or any other government. The heroic struggles of the Greeks themselves in which our warmest sympathies as free men and Christians have been engaged have continued to be maintained with vicissitudes of success adverse and favorable.Similar motives have rendered expedient the keeping of a like force on the coasts of Peru and Chile on the Pacific. The irregular and convulsive character of the war upon the shores has been extended to the conflicts upon the ocean. An active warfare has been kept up for years with alternate success though generally to the advantage of the American patriots. But their al forces have not always been under the control of their own governments. Blockades unjustifiable upon any acknowledged principles of international law have been proclaimed by officers in command and though disavowed by the supreme authorities the protection of our own commerce against them has been made cause of complaint and erroneous imputations against some of the most gallant officers of our Navy. Complaints equally groundless have been made by the commanders of the Spanish royal forces in those seas; but the most effective protection to our commerce has been the flag and the firmness of our own commanding officers.The cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause has removed it is hoped all cause of dissension with one party and all vestige of force of the other. But an unsettled coast of many degrees of latitude forming a part of our own territory and a flourishing commerce and fishery extending to the islands of the Pacific and to China still require that the protecting power of the Union should be displayed under its flag as well upon the ocean as upon the land.The objects of the West India Squadron have been to carry into execution the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade; for the protection of our commerce against vessels of piratical character though bearing commissions from either of the belligerent parties; for its protection against open and unequivocal pirates. These objects during the present year have been accomplished more effectually than at any former period. The African slave trade has long been excluded from the use of our flag and if some few citizens of our country have continued to set the laws of the Union as well as those of nature and humanity at defiance by persevering in that abominable traffic it has been only by sheltering themselves under the banners of other nations less earnest for the total extinction of the trade of ours.The active persevering and unremitted energy of Captain Warrington and of the officers and men under his command on that trying and perilous service have been crowned with signal success and are entitled to the approbation of their country. But experience has shown that not even a temporary suspension or relaxation from assuity can be indulged on that station without reproducing piracy and murder in all their horrors; nor is it probably that for years to come our immensely valuable commerce in those seas can igate in security without the steady continuance of an armed force devoted to its protection.It were indeed a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the present or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive and so rich as ours could exist and be pursued in safety without the continual support of a military marine—the only arm by which the power of this Confederacy can be estimated or felt by foreign nations and the only standing military force which can never be dangerous to our own liberties at home. A permanent al peace establishment therefore adapted to our present condition and adaptable to that gigantic growth with which the nation is advancing in its career is among the subjects which have already occupied the foresight of the last Congress and which will deserve your serious deliberations. Our Navy commenced at an early period of our present political organization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient energies the scanty resources and the comparative indigence of our infa
cy was even then found adequate to cope with all the powers of Barbary save the first and with one of the principle maritime powers of Europe.At a period of further advancement but with little accession of strength it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of conflicts but covered itself and our country with unfading glory. But it is only since the close of the late war that by the numbers and force of the ships of which it was composed it could deserve the name of a y. Yet it retains nearly the same organization as when it consisted only of five frigates. The rules and regulations by which it is governed earnestly call for revision and the want of a al school of instruction corresponding with the Military Academy at West Point for the formation of scientific and accomplished officers is felt with daily increasing aggravation.The act of Congress of 18240526 authorizing an examination and survey of the harbor of Charleston in South Carolina of St. Marys in Georgia and of the coast of Flora and for other purposes has been executed so far as the appropriation would admit. Those of the 3rd of March last authorizing the establishment of a y yard and depot on the coast of Flora in the Gulf of Mexico and authorizing the building of 10 sloops of war and for other purposes are in the course of execution for the particulars of which and other objects connected with this Department I refer to the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith communicated.A report from the Postmaster General is also submitted exhibiting the present flourishing condition of that Department. For the first time for many years the receipts for the year ending on the first of July last exceeded the expenditures during the same period to the amount of more than $45000. Other facts equally creditable to the administration of this Department are that in two years from 18230701 an improvement of more than $185000 in its pecuniary affairs has been realized; that in the same interval the increase of the transportation of the mail has exceeded 1500000 miles annually and that 1040 new post offices have been established. It hence appears that under judicious management the income from this establishment may be relied on as fully adequate to defray its expenses and that by the discontinuance of post roads altogether unproductive others of more useful character may be opened 'til the circulation of the mail shall keep pace with the spread of our population and the comforts of friendly correspondence the exchanges of internal traffic and the lights of the periodical press shall be distributed to the remotest corners of the Union at a charge scarcely perceptible to any inual and without the cost of a dollar to the public Treasury.Upon this first occasion of addressing the legislature of the Union with which I have been honored in presenting to their  the execution so far as it has been effected of the measures sanctioned by them for promoting the internal improvement of our country I can not close the communication without recommending to their calm and persevering conseration the general principle in a more enlarged extent. The great object of the institution of civil government is the improvement of the condition of those who are parties to the social compact and no government in what ever form constituted can accomplish the lawful ends of its institution but in proportion as it improves the condition of those over whom it is established. Roads and canals by multiplying and facilitating the communications and intercourse between distant regions and multitudes of men are among the most important means of improvement. But moral political intellectual improvement are duties assigned by the Author of Our Existence to social no less than to inual man.For the fulfillment of those duties governments are invested with power and to the attainment of the end—the progressive improvement of the condition of the governed—the exercise of delegated powers is a duty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of powers not granted is criminal and odious.Among the first perhaps the very first instrument for the improvement of the condition of men is knowledge and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapted to the wants the comforts and enjoyments of human life public institutions and seminaries of learning are essential. So convinced of this was the first of my predecessors in this office now first in the memory as living he was first in the hearts of our countrymen that once and again in his addresses to the Congresses with whom he cooperated in the public service he earnestly recommended the establishment of seminaries of learning to prepare for all the emergencies of peace and war—a national university and a military academy. With respect to the latter had he lived to the present day in turning his eyes to the institution at West Point he would have enjoyed the gratification of his most earnest wishes; but in surveying the city which has been honored with his name he would have seen the spot of earth which he had destined and bequeathed to the use and benefit of his country as the site for a university still bare and barren.In assuming her station among the civilized nations of the earth it would seem that our country had contracted the engagement to contribute her share of mind of labor and of expense to the improvement of those parts of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of inual acquisition and particularly to geographical and astronomical science. Looking back to the history only of the half century since the declaration of our independence and observing the generous emulation with which the governments of France Great Britain and Russia have devoted the genius the intelligence the treasures of their respective nations to the common improvement of the species in these branches of science is it not incumbent upon us to inquire whether we are not bound by obligations of a high and honorable character to contribute our portion of energy and exertion to the common stock? The voyages of discovery prosecuted in the course of that time at the expense of those nations have not only redounded to their glory but to the improvement of human knowledge.We have been partakers of that improvement and owe for it a sacred debt not only of gratitude but of equal or proportional exertion in the same common cause. Of the cost of these undertakings if the mere expenditures of outfit equipment and completion of the expeditions were to be consered the only charges it would be unworthy of a great and generous nation to take a second thought. One hundred expeditions of circumigation like those of Cook and La Prouse would not burden the exchequer of the nation fitting them out so much as the ways and means of defraying a single campaign in war. but if we take into account the lives of those benefactors of mankind of which their services in the cause of their species were the purchase how shall the cost of those heroic enterprises be estimated and what compensation can be made to them or to their countries for them? Is it not by bearing them in affectionate remembrance? Is it not still more by imitating their example—by enabling countrymen of our own to pursue the same career and to hazard their lives in the same cause?In inviting the attention of Congress to the subject of internal improvements upon a  thus enlarged it is not my desire to recommend the equipment of an expedition for circumigating the globe for purposes of scientific research and inquiry. We have objects of useful investigation nearer home and to which our cares may be more beneficially applied. The interior of our own territories has yet been very imperfectly explored. our coasts along many degrees of latitude upon the shores of the Pacific Ocean though much frequented by our spirited commercial igators have been barely visited by our public ships. The River of the West first fully discovered and igated by a countryman of our own still bears the name of the ship in which he ascended its waters and claims the protection of our armed national flag at its mouth. With the establishment of a military post there or at some other point of that coast recommended by my predecessor and already matured in the deliberations of the last Congress I would suggest the expediency of connecting the equipment of a public ship for the exploration of the whole northwest coast of this continent.The establishment of an uniform standard of weights and measures was one of the specific objects cond in the formation of our Constitution and to fix that standard was on of the powers delegated by express terms in that instrument to Congress. The governments of Great Britain and France have scarcely ceased to be occupied with inquiries and speculations on the same subject since the existence of our Constitution and with them it has expanded into profound laborious and expensive researches into the figure of the earth and the comparative length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in various latitudes from the equator to the pole. These researches have resulted in the composition and publication of several works highly interesting to the cause of science. The experiments are yet in the process of performance. Some of them have recently been made on our own shores within the walls of one of our own colleges and partly by one of our own fellow citizens. It would be honorable to our country if the sequel of the same experiments should be countenanced by the patronage of our government as they have hitherto been by those of France and Britain.Connected with the establishment of an university or separate from it might be undertaken the erection of an astronomical observatory with provision for the support of an astronomer to be in constant attendance of observation upon the phenomena of the heavens and for the periodical publication of his observances. it is with no feeling of pre as an American that the remark may be made that on the comparatively small territorial surface of Europe there are existing upward of 130 of these lighthouses of the skies while throughout the whole American hemisphere there is not one. If we reflect a moment upon the discoveries which in the last four centuries have been made in the physical constitution of the universe by the means of these buildings and of observers stationed in them shall we doubt of their usefulness to every nation? And while scarcely a year passes over our heads without bringing some new astronomical discovery to light which we must fain receive at second hand from Europe are we not cutting ourselves off from the means of returning light for light while we have neither observatory nor observer upon our half of the globe and the earth revolves in perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?When on 17911025 the first Present of the United States announced to Congress the result of the first enumeration of the inhabitants of this Union he informed them that the returns gave the pleasing assurance that the population of the United States bordered on 4000000 persons. At the distance of 30 years from that time the last enumeration five years since completed presented a population bordering on 10000000. Perhaps of all the evence of a prosperous and happy condition of human society the rapity of the increase of population is the most unequivocal. But the demonstration of our prosperity rests not alone upon this indication.Our commerce our wealth and the extent of our territories have increased in corresponding proportions and the number of independent communities associated in our federal Union has since that time nearly doubled. The legislative representation of the states and people in the two Houses of Congress has grown with the growth of their constituent bodies. The House which then consisted of 65 members now numbers upward of 200. The Senate which consisted of 26 members has now 48. But the executive and still more the judiciary departments are yet in a great measure confined to their primitive organization and are now not adequate to the urgent wants of a still growing community.The al armaments which at an early period forced themselves upon the necessities of the Union soon led to the establishment of a Department of the Navy. But the Departments of Foreign Affairs and of the Interior which early after the formation of the government had been united in one continue so united to this time to the unquestionable detriment of the public service. The multiplication of our relations with the nations and governments of the Old World has kept pace with that of our population and commerce while within the last 10 years a new family of nations in our own hemisphere has arisen among the inhabitants of the earth with whom our intercourse commercial and political would of itself furnish occupation to an active and industrious department.The constitution of the judiciary experimental and imperfect as it was even in the infancy of our existing government is yet more inadequate to the administration of national justice at our present maturity. Nine years have elapsed since a predecessor in this office now not the last the citizen who perhaps of all others throughout the Union contributed most to the formation and establishment of our Constitution in his valedictory address to Congress immediately preceding his retirement from public life urgently recommended the revision of the judiciary and the establishment of an additional executive department. The exigencies of the public service and its uoable deficiencies as now in exercise have added yearly cumulative weight to the conserations presented by him as persuasive to the measure and in recommending it to your deliberations I am happy to have the influence of this high authority in a of the undoubting convictions of my own experience.The laws relating to the administration of the Patent Office are deserving of much conseration and perhaps susceptible of some improvement. The grant of power to regulate the action of Congress upon this subject has specified both the end to be obtained and the means by which it is to be effected to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. If an honest pre might be indulged in the reflection that on the records of that office are already found inventions the usefulness of which has scarcely been transcended in the annals of human ingenuity would not its exultation be allayed by the inquiry whether the laws have effectively insured to the inventors the reward destined to them by the Constitution—even a limited term of exclusive right to their discoveries?On 17991224 it was resolved by Congress that a marble monument should be erected by the United States in the Capitol at the city of Washington; that the family of General Washington should be requested to permit his body to be deposited under it and that the monument be so designed as to commemorate the great events of his military and political life. In reminding Congress of this resolution and that the monument cond by it remains yet without execution I shall indulge only the remarks that the works at the Capitol are approaching to completion; that the consent of the family desired by the resolution was requested and obtained; that a monument has been recently erected in this city over the remains of another distinguished patriot of the Revolution and that a spot has been reserved within the walls where you are deliberating for the benefit of this and future ages in which the mortal remains may be deposited of him whose spirit hovers over you and listens with delight to every act of the representatives of his nation which can tend to exalt and adorn his and their country.The Constitution under which you are assembled is a charter of limited powers. After full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the objects which urged by an irresistible sense of my own duty I have recommended to your attention should you come to the conclusion that however desirable in themselves the enactment of laws for effecting them would transcend the powers committed to you by that venerable instrument which we are all bound to support let no conseration induce you to assume the exercise of powers not granted to you by the people.But if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases what so ever over the District of Columbia; if the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and prove for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; if the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes to fix the standard of weights and measures to establish post offices and post roads to declare war to raise and support armies to prove and maintain a y to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying these powers into execution—if these powers and others enumerated in the Constitution may be effectually brought into action by laws promoting the improvement of agriculture commerce and manufactures the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant arts the advancement of literature and the progress of the sciences ornamental and profound to refrain from exercising them for the benefit of the people themselves would be to he in the earth the talent committed to our charge—would be treachery to the most sacred of trusts.The spirit of improvement is abroad upon the earth. It stimulates the hearts and sharpens the faculties not of our fellow citizens alone but of the nations of Europe and of their rulers. While dwelling with pleasing satisfaction upon the superior excellence of our political institutions let us not be unmindful that liberty is power; that the nation blessed with the largest portion of liberty must in proportion to its numbers be the most powerful nation upon earth and that the tenure of power by man is in the moral purposes of his Creator upon condition that it shall be exercised to ends of beneficence to improve the condition of himself and his fellow men.While foreign nations less blessed with that freedom which is power than ourselves are advancing with gigantic stres in the career of public improvement were we to slumber in indolence or fold up our arms and proclaim to the world that we are palsied by the will of our constituents would it not be to cast away the bounties of Provence and doom ourselves to perpetual inferiority? In the course of the year now drawing to its close we have beheld under the auspices and at the expense of one state of this Union a new university unfolding its portals to the sons of science and holding up the torch of human improvement to eyes that seek the light. We have seen under the persevering and enlightened enterprise of another state the waters of our Western lakes mingle with those of the ocean. If undertakings like these have been accomplished in the compass of a few years by the authority of single members of our Confederation can we the representative authorities of the whole Union fall behind our fellow servants in the exercise of the trust committed to us for the benefit of our common sovereign by the accomplishment of works important to the whole and to which neither the authority nor the resources of any one state can be adequate?Finally fellow citizens I shall await with cheering hope and faithful cooperation the result of your deliberations assured that without encroaching upon the powers reserved to the authorities of the respective states or to the people you will with a due sense of your obligations to your country and of the high responsibilities weighing upon yourselves give efficacy to the means committed to you for the common good. And may who searches the hearts of the children of men prosper your exertions to secure the blessings of peace and promote the highest welfare of your country. 
Returning to the scenes of my birth and early life to the society of those with whom I was raised and who have been ever dear to me I receive fellow citizens and neighbors with inexpressible pleasure the cordial welcome you are so good as to give me. Long absent on duties which the history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to them the pomp the turmoil the bustle and splendor of office have drawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of private life for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you my neighbors and friends and the endearments of family love which nature has given us all as the sweetener of every hour. For these I gladly lay down the distressing burthen of power and seek with my fellow citizens repose and safety under the watchful cares the labors and perplexities of younger and abler minds. The anxieties you express to administer to my happiness do of themselves confer that happiness: and the measure will be complete if my endeavors to fulfill my duties in the several public stations to which I have been called have obtained for me the approbation of my country. The part which I have acted on the theatre of public life has been before them; and to their sentence I submit it: but the testimony of my native country of the inuals who have known me in private life to my conduct in its various duties and relations is the more grateful as proceeding from eye witnesses and observers from triers of the vicinage. Of you then my neighbors I may ask in the face of the world ?whose ox have I taken or whom have defrauded? Whom have I oppressed or of whose hand have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?? On your verdict I rest with conscious security. Your wishes for my happiness are received with just sensibility and I offer sincere prayers for your own welfare and prosperity. 
TO BROTHER HANDSOME LAKE:  I have received the message in writing which you sent me through Captain Irvine our confential agent placed near you for the purpose of communicating and transacting between us whatever may be useful for both nations. I am happy to learn you have been so far favored by the Divine spirit as to be made sensible of those things which are for your good and that of your people and of those which are hurtful to you; and particularly that you and they see the ruinous effects which the abuse of spirituous liquors have produced upon them. It has weakened their bodies enervated their minds exposed them to hunger cold nakedness and poverty kept them in perpetual broils and reduced their population. I do not wonder then brother at your censures not only on your own people who have voluntarily gone into these fatal habits but on all the nations of white people who have supplied their calls for this article. But these nations have done to you only what they do among themselves. They have sold what inuals wish to buy leaving to every one to be the guardian of his own health and happiness. Spirituous liquors are not in themselves bad they are often found to be an excellent medicine for the sick; it is the improper and intemperate use of them by those in health which makes them injurious. But as you find that your people cannot refrain from an ill use of them I greatly applaud your resolution not to use them at all. We have too affectionate a concern for your happiness to place the paltry gain on the sale of these articles in competition with the injury they do you. And as it is the desire of your nation that no spirits should be sent among them I am authorized by the great council of the United States to prohibit them. I will sincerely cooperate with your wise men in any proper measures for this purpose which shall be agreeable to them.  You remind me brother of what I sa to you when you visited me the last winter that the lands you then held would remain yours and shall never go from you but when you should be disposed to sell. This I now repeat and will ever abe by. We indeed are always ready to buy land; but we will never ask but when you wish to sell; and our laws in order to protect you against imposition have forbden inuals to purchase lands from you; and have rendered it necessary when you desire to sell even to a State that an agent from the United States should attend the sale see that your consent is freely given a satisfactory price pa and report to us what has been done for our approbation. This was done in the late case of which you complain. The deputies of your nation came forward in all the forms which we have been used to conser as evence of the will of your nation. They proposed to sell to the State of New York certain parcels of land of small extent and detached from the body of your other lands; the State of New York was desirous to buy. I sent an agent in whom we could trust to see that your consent was free and the sale fair. All was reported to be free and fair. The lands were your property. The right to sell is one of the rights of property. To forb you the exercise of that right would be a wrong to your nation. Nor do I think brother that the sale of lands is under all circumstances injurious to your people. While they depended on hunting the more extensive the forest around them the more game they would yield. But going into a state of agriculture it may be as advantageous to a society as it is to an inual who has more land than he can improve to sell a part and lay out the money in stocks and implements of agriculture for the better improvement of the resue. A little land well stocked and improved will yield more than a great deal without stock or improvement. I hope therefore that on further reflection you will see this transaction in a more favorable light both as it concerns the interest of your nation and the exercise of that superintending care which I am sincerely anxious to employ for their subsistence and happiness. Go on then brother in the great reformation you have undertaken. Persuade our red brethren then to be sober and to cultivate their lands; and their women to spin and weave for their families. You will soon see your women and children well fed and clothed your men living happily in peace and plenty and your numbers increasing from year to year. It will be a great glory to you to have been the instrument of so happy a change and your children's children from generation to generation will repeat your name with love and gratitude forever. In all your enterprises for the good of your people you may count with confence on the a and protection of the United States and on the sincerity and zeal with which I am myself animated in the furthering of this humane work. You are our brethren of the same land; we wish your prosperity as brethren should do. Farewell. <
 GENTLEMAN  The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me on behalf of the Danbury Baptist Association give me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents and in proportion as they are persuaded of my felity to those duties the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.  Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legislative powers of government reach actions only and not opinions I con with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.  I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common Father and Creator of man and tender you for yourselves and your religious association assurances of my high respect and esteem. 
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:The public buildings being advanced to a stage to afford accommodation for Congress I offer you my sincere congratulations on the recommencement of your duties in the Capitol. In bringing you to  the incents most deserving attention which have occurred since your last session I regret to have to state that several of our principal cities have suffered by sickness that an unusual drought has prevailed in the Mdle and Western States and that a derangement has been felt in some of our moneyed institutions which has proportionably affected their credit. I am happy however to have it in my power to assure you that the health of our cities is now completely restored; that the produce of the year though less abundant than usual will not only be amply sufficient for home consumption but afford a large surplus for the supply of the wants of other nations and that the derangement in the circulating paper medium by being left to those remedies which its obvious causes suggested and the good sense and virtue of our fellow citizens supplied has diminished. Having informed Congress on the 27th of February last that a treaty of amity settlement and limits had been concluded in this city between the United States and Spain and ratified by the competent authorities of the former full confence was entertained that it would have been ratified by His Catholic Majesty with equal promptitude and a like earnest desire to terminate on the conditions of that treaty the differences which had so long existed between the two countries. Every  which the subject admitted of was thought to have justified this conclusion. Great losses had been sustained by citizens of the United States from Spanish cruisers more than 20 years before which had not been redressed. These losses had been acknowledged and proved for by a treaty as far back as the year 1802 which although concluded at Madr was not then ratified by the Government of Spain nor since until the last year when it was suspended by the late treaty a more satisfactory provision to both parties as was presumed having been made for them. Other differences had arisen in this long interval affecting their highest interests which were likewise proved for by this last treaty. The treaty itself was formed on great conseration and a thorough knowledge of all circumstances the subject matter of every article having been for years under discussion and repeated references having been made by the minister of Spain to his Government on the points respecting which the greatest difference of opinion prevailed. It was formed by a minister duly authorized for the purpose who had represented his Government in the United States and been employed in this long protracted negotiation several years and who it is not denied kept strictly within the letter of his instructions. The faith of Spain was therefore pledged under circumstances of peculiar force and solemnity for its ratification. On the part of the United States this treaty was evently acceded to in a spirit of conciliation and concession. The indemnity for injuries and losses so long before sustained and now again acknowledged and proved for was to be pa by them without becoming a charge on the treasury of Spain. for territory ceded by Spain other territory of great value to which our claim was believed to be well founded was ceded by the United States and in a quarter more interesting to her. This cession was nevertheless received as the means of indemnifying our citizens in a conserable sum the presumed amount of their losses. Other conserations of great weight urged the cession of this territory by Spain. It was surrounded by the Territories of the United States on every se except on that of the ocean. Spain had lost her authority over it and falling into the hands of adventurers connected with the savages it was made the means of unceasing annoyance and injury to our Union in many of its most essential interests. By this cession then Spain ceded a territory in reality of no value to her and obtained concessions of the highest importance by the settlement of long standing differences with the United States affecting their respective claims and limits and likewise relieved herself from the obligation of a treaty relating to it which she had failed to fulfill and also from the responsibility incent to the most flagrant and pernicious abuses of her rights where she could not support her authority. It being known that the treaty was formed under these circumstances not a doubt was entertained that His Catholic Majesty would have ratified it without delay. I regret to have to state that this reasonable expectation has been disappointed; that the treaty was not ratified within the time stipulated and has not since been ratified. As it is important that the nature and character of this unexpected occurrence should be distinctly understood I think it my duty to communicate to you all the facts and circumstances in my possession relating to it. Anxious to prevent all future disagreement with Spain by giving the most prompt effect to the treaty which had been thus concluded and particularly by the establishment of a Government in Flora which should preserve order there the minister of the United States who had been recently appointed to His Catholic Majesty and to whom the ratification by his Government had been committed to be exchanged for that of Spain was instructed to transmit the latter to the Department of State as soon as obtained by a public ship subjected to his order for the purpose. Unexpected delay occurring in the ratification by Spain he requested to be informed of the cause. It was stated in reply that the great importance of the subject and a desire to obtain explanations on certain points which were not specified had produced the delay and that an envoy would be dispatched to the United States to obtain such explanations of this Government. The minister of the United States offered to give full explanation on any point on which it might be desired which proposal was declined. Having communicated this result to the Department of State in August last he was instructed notwithstanding the disappointment and surprise which it produced to inform the Government of Spain that if the treaty should be ratified and transmitted here at any time before the meeting of Congress it would be received and have the same effect as if it had been ratified in due time. This order was executed the authorized communication was made to the Government of Spain and by its answer which has just been received we are officially made acquainted for the first time with the causes which have prevented the ratification of the treaty by His Catholic Majesty. It is alleged by the minister of Spain that his Government had attempted to alter one of the principal articles of the treaty by a declaration which the minister of the United States had been ordered to present when he should deliver the ratification by his Government in exchange for that of Spain and of which he gave notice explanatory of the sense in which that article was understood. It is further alleged that this Government had recently tolerated or protected an expedition from the United States against the Province of Texas. These two imputed acts are stated as the reasons which have induced His Catholic Majesty to withhold his ratification from the treaty to obtain explanations respecting which it is repeated that an envoy would be forthwith dispatched to the United States. How far these allegations will justify the conduct of the Government of Spain will appear on a  of the following facts and the evence which supports them: It will be seen by the documents transmitted herewith that the declaration mentioned relates to a clause in the 8th article concerning certain grants of land recently made by His Catholic Majesty in Flora which it was understood had conveyed all the lands which until then had been ungranted; it was the intention of the parties to annul these latter grants and that clause was drawn for that express purpose and for none other. The date of these grants was unknown but it was understood to be posterior to that inserted in the article; indeed it must be obvious to all that if that provision in the treaty had not the effect of annulling these grants it would be altogether nugatory. Immediately after the treaty was concluded and ratified by this Government an intimation was received that these grants were of anterior date to that fixed on by the treaty and that they would not of course be affected by it. The mere possibility of such a case so inconsistent with the intention of the parties and the meaning of the article induced this Government to demand an explanation on the subject which was immediately granted and which corresponds with this statement. WRT the other act alleged that this Government had tolerated or protected an expedition against Texas it is utterly without foundation. Every discountenance has invariably been given to any such attempt within the limits of the United States as is fully evinced by the acts of the Government and the proceedings of the courts. There being cause however to apprehend in the course of the last summer that some adventurers entertained s of the kind suggested the attention of the constituted authorities in that quarter was immediately drawn to them and it is known that the project whatever it might be has utterly failed. These facts will it is presumed satisfy every impartial mind that the Government of Spain had no justifiable cause for declining to ratify the treaty. A treaty concluded in conformity with instructions is obligatory in good faith in all its stipulations according to the true intent and meaning of the parties. Each party is bound to ratify it. If either could set it ase without the consent of the other there would be no longer any rules applicable to such transactions between nations. By this proceeding the Government of Spain has rendered to the United States a new and very serious injury. It has been stated that a minister would be sent to ask certain explanations of this Government; but if such were desired why were they not asked within the time limited for the ratification? Is it cond to open a new negotiation respecting any of the articles or conditions of the treaty? If that were done to what consequences might it not lead? At what time and in what manner would a new negotiation terminate? By this proceeding Spain has formed a relation between the two countries which will justify any measures on the part of the United States which a strong sense of injury and a proper regard for the rights and interests of the nation may dictate. In the course to be pursued these objects should be constantly held in  and have their due weight. Our national honor must be maintained and a new and a distinguished proof be afforded of that regard for justice and moderation which has invariably governed the councils of this free people. It must be obvious to all that if the United States had been desirous of making conquests or had been even willing to aggrandize themselves in that way they could have had no inducement to form this treaty. They would have much cause for gratulation at the course which has been pursued by Spain. An ample field for ambition is open before them but such a career is not consistent with the principles of their Government nor the interests of the nation. From a full  of all circumstances it is submitted to the conseration of Congress whether it will not be proper for the United States to carry the conditions of the treaty into effect in the same manner as if it had been ratified by Spain claiming on their part all its advantages and yielding to Spain those secured to her. By pursuing this course we shall rest on the sacred ground of right sanctioned in the most solemn manner by Spain herself by a treaty which she was bound to ratify for refusing to do which she must incur the censure of other nations even those most friendly to her while by confining ourselves within that limit we can not fail to obtain their wellmerited approbation. We must have peace on a frontier where we have been so long disturbed; our citizens must be indemnified for losses so long since sustained and for which indemnity has been so unjustly withheld from them. Accomplishing these great objects we obtain all that is desirable. But His Catholic Majesty has twice declared his determination to send a minister to the United States to ask explanations on certain points and to give them respecting his delay to ratify the treaty. Shall we act by taking the ceded territory and proceeding to execute the other conditions of the treaty before this minister arrives and is heard? This is a case which forms a strong appeal to the candor the magnanimity and the honor of this people. Much is due to courtesy between nations. By a short delay we shall lose nothing for resting on the ground of immutable truth and justice we can not be erted from our purpose. It ought to be presumed that the explanations which may be given to the minister of Spain will be satisfactory and produce the desired result. In any event the delay for the purpose mentioned being a further manifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly manner all differences with Spain can not fail to be duly appreciated by His Catholic Majesty as well as by other powers. It is submitted therefore whether it will not be proper to make the law proposed for carrying the conditions of the treaty into effect should it be adopted contingent; to suspend its operation upon the responsibility of the Executive in such manner as to afford an opportunity for such friendly explanations as may be desired during the present session of Congress. I communicate to Congress a copy of the treaty and of the instructions to the minister of the United States at Madr respecting it; of his correspondence with the minister of Spain and of such other documents as may be necessary to give a full  of the subject. In the course which the Spanish Government have on this occasion thought proper to pursue it is satisfactory to know that they have not been countenanced by any other European power. On the contrary the opinion and wishes both of France and Great Britain have not been withheld either from the United States or from Spain and have been unequivocal in favor of the ratification. There is also reason to believe that the sentiments of the Imperial Government of Russia have been the same and that they have also been made known to the cabinet of Madr. In the civil war existing between Spain and the Spanish Provinces in this hemisphere the greatest care has been taken to enforce the laws intended to preserve an impartial neutrality. Our ports have continued to be equally open to both parties and on the same conditions and our citizens have been equally restrained from interfering in favor of either to the prejudice of the other. The progress of the war however has operated manifestly in favor of the colonies. Buenos Ayres still maintains unshaken the independence which it declared in 1816 and has enjoyed since 1810. Like success has also lately attended Chili and the Provinces north of the La Plata bordering on it and likewise Venezuela. This contest has from its commencement been very interesting to other powers and to none more so than to the United States. A virtuous people may and will confine themselves within the limit of a strict neutrality; but it is not in their power to behold a conflict so vitally important to their neighbors without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally belong to such a case. It has been the steady purpose of this Government to prevent that feeling leading to excess and it is very gratifying to have it in my power to state that so strong has been the sense throughout the whole community of what was due to the character and obligations of the nation that very few examples of a contrary kind have occurred. The distance of the colonies from the parent country and the great extent of their population and resources gave them advantages which it was anticipated at a very early period would be difficult for Spain to surmount. The steadiness consistency and success with which they have pursued their object as evinced more particularly by the undisturbed sovereignty which Buenos Ayres has so long enjoyed evently give them a strong claim to the favorable conseration of other nations. These sentiments on the part of the United States have not been withheld from other powers with whom it is desirable to act in concert. Should it become manifest to the world that the efforts of Spain to subdue these Provinces will be fruitless it may be presumed that the Spanish Government itself will give up the contest. In producing such a determination it can not be doubted that the opinion of friendly powers who have taken no part in the controversy will have their merited influence. It is of the highest importance to our national character and indispensable to the morality of our citizens that all violations of our neutrality should be prevented. No door should be left open for the evasion of our laws no opportunity afforded to any who may be disposed to take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation. It is submitted therefore to the conseration of Congress whether it may not be advisable to revise the laws with a  to this desirable result. It is submitted also whether it may not be proper to designate by law the several ports or places along the coast at which only foreign ships of war and privateers may be admitted. The difficulty of sustaining the regulations of our commerce and of other important interests from abuse without such designation furnishes a strong motive for this measure. At the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial convention between the United States and Great Britain a hope had been entertained that an article might have been agreed upon mutually satisfactory to both countries regulating upon principles of justice and reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British possessions as well in the West Indies as upon the continent of North America. The plenipotentiaries of the two Governments not having been able to come to an agreement on this important interest those of the United States reserved for the conseration of this Government the proposals which had been presented to them as the ultimate offer on the part of the British Government and which they were not authorized to accept. On their transmission here they were examined with due deliberation the result of which was a new effort to meet the s of the British Government. The minister of the United States was instructed to make a further proposal which has not been accepted. It was however declined in an amicable manner. I recommend to the conseration of Congress whether further prohibitory provisions in the laws relating to this intercourse may not be expedient. It is seen with interest that although it has not been practicable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important branch of their commerce such is the disposition of the parties that each will  any regulations which the other may make respecting it in the most friendly light. By the 5th article of the convention concluded on [18181020] it was stipulated that the differences which have arisen between the two Governments with respect to the true intent and meaning of the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent in relation to the carrying away by British officers of slaves from the United States after the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of peace should be referred to the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be named for that purpose. The minister of the United States has been instructed to name to the British Government a foreign sovereign the common friend to both parties for the decision of this question. The answer of that Government to the proposal when received will indicate the further measures to be pursued on the part of the United States. Although the pecuniary embarrassments which affected various parts of the Union during the latter part of the preceding year have during the present been conserably augmented and still continue to exist the receipts into the Treasury to the 30th of September last have amounted to $19M. After defraying the current expenses of the Government including the interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period amounting to $18.2M there remained in the Treasury on that day more than $2.5M which with the sums receivable during the remainder of the year will exceed the current demands upon the Treasury for the same period. The causes which have tended to diminish the public receipts could not fail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which has accrued upon imposts and tonnage during the three first quarters of the present year. It is however ascertained that the duties which have been secured during that period exceed $18M and those of the whole year will probably amount to $23M. For the probably receipts of the next year I refer you to the statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury which will enable you to judge whether further provision be necessary. The great reduction in the price of the principal articles of domestic growth which has occurred during the present year and the consequent fall in the price of labor apparently so favorable to the success of domestic manufactures have not shielded them against other causes adverse to their prosperity. The pecuniary embarrassments which have so deeply affected the commercial interests of the nation have been no less adverse to our manufacturing establishments in several sections of the Union. The great reduction of the currency which the banks have been constrained to make in order to continue specie payments and the vitiated character of it where such reductions have not been attempted instead of placing within the reach of these establishments the pecuniary a necessary to avail themselves of the advantages resulting from the reduction in the prices of the raw materials and of labor have compelled the banks to withdraw from them a portion of the capital heretofore advanced to them. That a which has been refused by the banks has not been obtained from other sources owing to the loss of inual confence from the frequent failures which have recently occurred in some of our principal commercial cities. An additional cause for the depression of these establishments may probably be found in the pecuniary embarrassments which have recently affected those countries with which our commerce has been principally prosecuted. Their manufactures for the want of a ready or profitable market at home have been shipped by the manufacturers to the United States and in many instances sold at a price below their current value at the place of manufacture. Although this practice may from its nature be consered temporary or contingent it is not on that account less injurious in its effects. Uniformity in the demand and price of an article is highly desirable to the domestic manufacturer. It is deemed of great importance to give encouragement to our domestic manufacturers. In what manner the evils which have been adverted to may be remedied and how far it may be practicable in other respects to afford to them further encouragement paying due regard to the other great interests of the nation is submitted to the wisdom of Congress. The survey of the coast for the establishment of fortifications is now nearly completed and conserable progress has been made in the collection of materials for the construction of fortifications in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Chesapeake Bay. The works on the eastern bank of the Potomac below Alexandria and on the Pea Patch in the Delaware are much advanced and it is expected that the fortifications at the Narrows in the harbor of NY will be completed the present year. To derive all the advantages cond from these fortifications it was necessary that they should be judiciously posted and constructed with a  to permanence. The progress hitherto has therefore been slow; but as the difficulties in parts heretofore the least explored and known are surmounted it will in future be more rap. As soon as the survey of the coast is completed which it is expected will be done early in the next spring the engineers employed in it will proceed to examine for like purposes the northern and northwestern frontiers. The troops intended to occupy a station at the mouth of the St. Peters on the Mississippi have established themselves there and those who were ordered to the mouth of the Yellow Stone on the Missouri have ascended that river to the Council Bluff where they will remain until the next spring when they will proceed to the place of their destination. I have the satisfaction to state that this measure has been executed in amity with the Indian tribes and that it promises to produce in regard to them all the advantages which were cond by it. Much progress has likewise been made in the construction of ships of war and in the collection of timber and other materials for ship building. It is not doubted that our Navy will soon be augmented to the number and placed in all respects on the footing proved for by law. The Board consisting of engineers and al officers have not yet made their final report of sites for two al depots as instructed according to the resolutions of [18180318] and [18180420] but they have examined the coast therein designated and their report is expected in the next month. For the protection of our commerce in the Mediterranean along the southern Atlantic coast in the Pacific and Indian oceans it has been found necessary to maintain a strong al force which it seems proper for the present to continue. There is much reason to believe that if any portion of the squadron heretofore stationed in the Mediterranean should be withdrawn our intercourse with the powers bordering on that sea would be much interrupted if not altogether destroyed. Such too has been the growth of a spirit of piracy in the other quarters mentioned by adventurers from every country in abuse of the friendly flags which they have assumed that not to protect our commerce there would be to abandon it has a prey to their rapacity. Due attention has likewise been pa to the suppression of the slave trade in compliance with a law of the last session. Orders have been given to the commanders of all our public ships to seize all vessels igated under our flag engaged in that trade and to bring them in to be proceeded against in the manner prescribed by the law. It is hoped that these vigorous measures supported by like acts by other nations will soon terminate a commerce so disgraceful to the civilized world. In the execution of the duty imposed by these acts and of a high trust connected with it it is with deep regret I have to state the loss which has been sustained by the death of Commodore Perry. His gallantry in a brilliant exploit in the late war added to the renown of his country. His death is deplored as a national misfortune. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: The depredations which had been committed on the commerce of the United States during a preceding war by persons under the authority of Spain are sufficiently known to all. These made it a duty to require from that Government indemnifications for our injured citizens. A convention was accordingly entered into between the minister of the United States at Madr and the minister of that Government for foreign affairs by which it was agreed that spoliations committed by Spanish subjects and carried into ports of Spain should be pa for by that nation and that those committed by French subjects and carried into Spanish ports should remain for further discussion. Before this convention was returned to Spain with our ratification the transfer of Louisiana by France to the United States took place an event as unexpected as disagreeable to Spain. From that moment she seemed to change her conduct and dispositions toward us. It was first manifested by her protest against the right of France to alienate Louisiana to us which however was soon retracted and the right confirmed. Then high offense was manifested at the act of Congress establishing a collection district on the Mobile although by an authentic declaration immediately made it was expressly confined to our acknowledged limits; and she now refused to ratify the convention signed by her own minister under the eye of his Sovereign unless we would consent to alterations of its terms which would have affected our claims against her for the spoliations by French subjects carried into Spanish ports.To obtain justice as well as to restore friendship I thought a special mission advisable and accordingly appointed James Monroe minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to repair to Madr and in conjunction with our minister resent there to endeavor to procure a ratification of the former convention and to come to an understanding with Spain as to the boundaries of Louisiana. It appeared at once that her policy was to reserve herself for events and in the meantime to keep our differences in an undetermined state. This will be event from the papers now communicated to you. After nearly five months of fruitless endeavor to bring them to some definite and satisfactory result our ministers ended the conferences without having been able to obtain indemnity for spoliations of any description or any satisfaction as to the boundaries of Louisiana other than a declaration that we had no rights eastward of the Iberville and that our line to the west was one which would have left us but a string of land on that bank of the river Mississippi. Our injured citizens were thus left without any prospect of retribution from the wrongdoer and as to boundary each party was to take its own course. That which they have chosen to pursue will appear from the documents now communicated. They authorize the inference that it is their intention to advance on our possessions until they shall be repressed by an opposing force. Consering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any degree which could be avoed. I have barely instructed the officers stationed in the neighborhood of the aggressions to protect our citizens from violence to patrol within the borders actually delivered to us and not to go out of them but when necessary to repel an inroad or to rescue a citizen or his property; and the Spanish officers remaining at New Orleans are required to depart without further delay. It ought to be noted here that since the late change in the state of affairs in Europe Spain has ordered her cruisers and courts to respect our treaty with her.The conduct of France and the part she may take in the misunderstandings between the United States and Spain are too important to be unconsered. She was prompt and deced in her declarations that our demands on Spain for French spoliations carried into Spanish ports were included in the settlement between the United States and France. She took at once the ground that she had acquired no right from Spain and had meant to deliver us none eastward of the Iberville her silence as to the western boundary leaving us to infer her opinion might be against Spain in that quarter. Whatever direction she might mean to give to these differences it does not appear that she has cond their proceeding to actual rupture or that at the date of our last advices from Paris her Government had any suspicion of the hostile attitude Spain had taken here; on the contrary we have reason to believe that she was disposed to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what our ministers had proposed and so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the grounds of future collision and controversy on the eastern as well as western se of the Mississippi.The present crisis in Europe is favorable for pressing such a settlement and not a moment should be lost in availing ourselves of it. Should it pass unimproved our situation would become much more difficult. Formal war is not necessaryit is not probable it will follow; but the protection of our citizens the spirit and honor of our country require that force should be interposed to a certain degree It will probably contribute to advance the object of peace.But the course to be pursued will require the command of means which it belongs to Congress exclusively to yield or to deny. To them I communicate every fact material for their information and the documents necessary to enable them to judge for themselves. To their wisdom then I look for the course I am to pursue and will pursue with sincere zeal that which they shall approve.TH: JEFFERSON.
 About to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me I find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confence and of the responsibility united with it. The impressions on me are strengthened by such an evence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated and by a conseration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed. From the weight and magnitude now belonging to it I should be compelled to shrink if I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation which forms so prominent a feature in our situation is stamped with that justice which invites the smiles of Heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination. May we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the characters by which this war is distinguished? It was not declared on the part of the United States until it had been long made on them in reality though not in name; until arguments and postulations had been exhausted; until a positive declaration had been received that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued; nor until this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down the spirit of the nation destroying all confence in itself and in its political institutions and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe struggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers. On the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important  of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other . Not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection. I need not call into  the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones nor paint the outrages inseparable from it. The proofs are in the records of each successive Administration of our Government and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the American people have found their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature. As the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor no usage of civilized nations no precept of courtesy or humanity have been infringed. The war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed. How little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy! They have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the United States not liable to be so consered under the usages of war. They have refused to conser as prisoners of war and threatened to punish as traitors and deserters persons emigrating without restraint to the United States incorporated by naturalization into our political family and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety. Such is the avowed purpose of a Government which is in the practice of naturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries and not only of permitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native country. They have not it is true taken into their own hands the hatchet and the knife devoted to indiscriminate massacre but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments; have allured them into their service and carried them to battle by their ses eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives. And what was never before seen British commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates. And now we find them in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society to dismember our confederated Republic. Happily like others these will recoil on the authors; but they mark the degenerate counsels from which they emanate and if they d not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as proceeding from a Government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary. To render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress. The sword was scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed. Still more precise advances were repeated and have been received in a spirit forbding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation. These resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue. Our nation is in number more than half that of the British Isles. It is composed of a brave a free a virtuous and an intelligent people. Our country abounds in the necessaries the arts and the comforts of life. A general prosperity is visible in the public countenance. The means employed by the British cabinet to undermine it have recoiled on themselves; have given to our national faculties a more rap development and draining or erting the precious metals from British circulation and British vaults have poured them into those of the United States. It is a propitious conseration that an uoable war should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it. When the public voice called for war all knew and still know that without them it could not be carried on through the period which it might last and the patriotism the good sense and the manly spirit of our fellowcitizens are pledges for the cheerfulness with which they will bear each his share of the common burden. To render the war short and its success sure animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary and the success of our arms now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to them. Already have the gallant exploits of our al heroes proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element. If the reputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other presaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting to correspondent triumphs there also but the discipline and habits which are in daily progress. 
We have long heard of your nation as a numerous peaceable and friendly people; but this is the first visit we have had from its great men at the seat of our government. I welcome you here; am glad to take you by the hand and to assure you for your nation that we are their friends. Born in the same land we ought to live as brothers doing to each other all the good we can and not listening to wicked men who may endeavor to make us enemies. By living in peace we can help and prosper one another; by waging war we can kill and destroy many on both ses; but those who survive will not be the happier for that. Then brothers let it forever be peace and good neighborhood between us. Our seventeen States compose a great and growing nation. Their children are as the leaves of the trees which the winds are spreading over the forest. But we are just also. We take from no nation what belongs to it. Our growing numbers make us always willing to buy lands from our red brethren when they are willing to sell. But be assured we never mean to disturb them in their possessions. On the contrary the lines established between us by mutual consent shall be sacredly preserved and will protect your lands from all encroachments by our own people or any others. We will give you a copy of the law made by our great Council for punishing our people who may encroach on your lands or injure you otherwise. Carry it with you to your homes and preserve it as the shield which we spread over you to protect your land your property and persons.< It is at the request which you sent me in September signed by Puckshanublee and other chiefs and which you now repeat that I listen to your proposition to sell us lands. You say you owe a great debt to your merchants that you have nothing to pay it with but lands and you pray us to take lands and pay your debt. The sum you have occasion for brothers is a very great one. We have never yet pa as much to any of our red brethren for the purchase of lands. You propose to us some on the Tombigbee and some on the Mississippi. Those on the Mississippi suit us well. We wish to have establishments on that river as resting places for our boats to furnish them provisions and to receive our people who fall sick on the way to or from New Orleans which is now ours. In that quarter therefore we are willing to purchase as much as you will spare. But as to the manner in which the line shall be run we are not judges of it here nor qualified to make any bargain. But we will appoint persons hereafter to treat with you on the spot who knowing the country and quality of the lands will be better able to agree with you on a line which will give us a just equivalent for the sum of money you want pa.< You have spoken brothers of the lands which your fathers formerly sold and marked off to the English and which they ceded to us with the rest of the country they held here; and you say that though you do not know whether your fathers were pa for them you have marked the line over again for us and do not ask repayment. It has always been the custom brothers when lands were bought of the red men to pay for them immediately and none of us have ever seen an example of such a debt remaining unpa. It is to satisfy their immediate wants that the red men have usually sold lands; and in such a case they would not let the debt be unpa. The presumption from custom then is strong; so it is also from the great length of time since your fathers sold these lands. But we have moreover been informed by persons now living and who assisted the English in making the purchase that the price was pa at the time. Were it otherwise as it was their contract it would be their debt not ours.< I rejoice brothers to hear you propose to become cultivators of the earth for the maintenance of your families. Be assured you will support them better and with less labor by raising stock and bread and by spinning and weaving clothes than by hunting. A little land cultivated and a little labor will procure more provisions than the most successful hunt; and a woman will clothe more by spinning and weaving than a man by hunting. Compared with you we are but as of yesterday in this land. Yet see how much more we have multiplied by industry and the exercise of that reason which you possess in common with us. Follow then our example brethren and we will a you with great pleasure.< The clothes and other necessaries which we sent you the last year were as you supposed a present from us. We never meant to ask land or any other payment for them; and the store which we sent on was at your request also; and to accommodate you with necessaries at a reasonable price you wished of course to have it on your land; but the land would continue yours not ours.< As to the removal of the store the interpreter and the agent and any other matters you may wish to speak about the Secretary at War will enter into explanations with you and whatever he says you may conser as sa by myself and what he promises you will be faithfully performed.< I am glad brothers you are willing to go and visit some other parts of our country. Carriages shall be ready to convey you and you shall be taken care of on your journey; and when you shall have returned here and rested yourselves to your own mind you shall be sent home by land. We had proved for your coming by land and were sorry for the mistake which carried you to Savannah instead of Augusta and exposed you to the risks of a voyage by sea. Had any accent happened to you though we could not help it it would have been a cause of great mourning to us. But we thank the Great Spirit who took care of you on the ocean and brought you safe and in good health to the seat of our great Council; and we hope His care will accompany and protect you on your journey and return home; and that will preserve and prosper your nation in all its just pursuits.
To the Senate of the United States:< In the message to both Houses of Congress at the commencement of the session it was mentioned that the Governments of the Republics of Colombia of Mexico and of Central America had severally invited the Government of the United States to be represented at the Congress of American nations to be assembled at Panama to deliberate upon objects of peculiar concernment to this hemisphere and that this invitation had been accepted.< Although this measure was deemed to be within the constitutional competency of the Executive I have not thought proper to take any step in it before ascertaining that my opinion of its expediency will concur with that of both branches of the Legislature first by the decision of the Senate upon the nominations to be la before them and secondly by the sanction of both Houses to the appropriations without which it can not be carried into effect.< A report from the Secretary of State and copies of the correspondence with the South American Governments on this subject since the invitation given by them are herewith transmitted to the Senate. They will disclose the objects of importance which are expected to form a subject of discussion at this meeting in which interests of high importance to this Union are involved. It will be seen that the United States neither intend nor are expected to take part in any deliberations of a belligerent character; that the motive of their attendance is neither to contract alliances nor to engage in any undertaking or project importing hostility to any other nation.< But the Southern American nations in the infancy of their independence often find themselves in positions with reference to other countries with the principles applicable to which derivable from the state of independence itself they have not been familiarized by experience. The result of this has been that sometimes in their intercourse with the United States they have manifested dispositions to reserve a right of granting special favors and privileges to the Spanish nation as the price of their recognition. At others they have actually established duties and impositions operating unfavorably to the United States to the advantage of other European powers and sometimes they have appeared to conser that they might interchange among themselves mutual concessions of exclusive favor to which neither European powers nor the United States should be admitted. In most of these cases their regulations unfavorable to us have yielded to friendly expostulation and remonstrance. But it is believed to be of infinite moment that the principles of a liberal commercial intercourse should be exhibited to them and urged with disinterested and friendly persuasion upon them when all assembled for the avowed purpose of consulting together upon the establishment of such principles as may have an important bearing upon their future welfare.< The consentaneous adoption of principles of maritime neutrality and favorable to the igation of peace and commerce in time of war will also form a subject of conseration to this Congress. The doctrine that free ships make free goods and the restrictions of reason upon the extent of ades may be established by general agreement with far more ease and perhaps with less danger by the general engagement to adhere to them concerted at such a meeting than by partial treaties or conventions with each of the nations separately. An agreement between all the parties represented at the meeting that each will guard by its own means against the establishment of any future European colony within its borders may be found advisable. This was more than two years since announced by my predecessor to the world as a principle resulting from the emancipation of both the American continents. It may be so developed to the new southern nations that they will all feel it as an essential appendage to their independence.< There is yet another subject upon which without entering into any treaty the moral influence of the United States may perhaps be exerted with beneficial consequences at such a meetingthe advancement of religious liberty. Some of the southern nations are even yet so far under the dominion of prejudice that they have incorporated with their political constitutions an exclusive church without toleration of any other than the dominant sect. The abandonment of this last badge of religious bigotry and oppression may be pressed more effectually by the united exertions of those who concur in the principles of freedom of conscience upon those who are yet to be convinced of their justice and wisdom than by the solitary efforts of a minister to any one of the separate Governments.< The indirect influence which the United States may exercise upon any projects or purposes originating in the war in which the southern Republics are still engaged which might seriously affect the interests of this Union and the good offices by which the United States may ultimately contribute to bring that war to a speedier termination though among the motives which have convinced me of the propriety of complying with this invitation are so far contingent and eventual that it would be improper to dwell upon them more at large.< In fine a decisive inducement with me for acceding to the measure is to show by this token of respect to the southern Republics the interest that we take in their welfare and our disposition to comply with their wishes. Having been the first to recognize their independence and sympathized with them so far as was compatible with our neutral duties in all their struggles and sufferings to acquire it we have la the foundation of our future intercourse with them in the broadest principles of reciprocity and the most cordial feelings of fraternal friendship. To extend those principles to all our commercial relations with them and to hand down that friendship to future ages is congenial to the highest policy of the Union as it will be to that of all those nations and their posterity. In the confence that these sentiments will meet the approbation of the Senate I nominate Richard C. Anderson of Kentucky and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania to be envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary to the assembly of American nations at Panama and William B. Rochester of New York to be secretary to the mission.< 
Whereas the enemy by a sudden incursion have succeeded in invading the capital of the nation defended at the moment by troops less numerous than their own and almost entirely of the militia during their possession of which though for a single day only they wantonly destroyed the public edifices having no relation in their structure to operations of war nor used at the time for military annoyance some of these edifices being also costly monuments of taste and of the arts and others depositories of the public archives not only precious to the nation as the memorials of its origin and its early transactions but interesting to all nations as contributions to the general stock of historical instruction and political science; andWhereas advantage has been taken of the loss of a fort more immediately guarding the neighboring town of Alexandria to place the town within the range of a al force too long and too much in the habit of abusing its superiority wherever it can be applied to require as the alternative of a general conflagration an undisturbed plunder of private property which has been executed in a manner peculiarly distressing to the inhabitants who had inconserately cast themselves upon the justice and generosity of the victor; andWhereas it now appears by a direct communication from the British commander on the American station to be his avowed purpose to employ the force under his direction in destroying and laying waste such towns and districts upon the coast as may be found assailable adding to this declaration the insulting pretext that it is in retaliation for a wanton destruction committed by the army of the United States in Upper Canada when it is notorious that no destruction has been committed which notwithstanding the multiplied outrages previously committed by the enemy was not unauthorized and promptly shown to be so and that the United States have been as constant in their endeavors to reclaim the enemy from such outrages by the contrast of their own example as they have been ready to terminate on reasonable conditions the war itself; andWhereas these proceedings and declared purposes which exhibit a deliberate disregard of the principles of humanity and the rules of civilized warfare and which must give to the existing war a character of extended devastation and barbarism at the very moment of negotiations for peace invited by the enemy himself leave no prospect of safety to anything within the reach of his predatory and incendiary operations but in manful and universal determination to chastise and expel the invader:Now therefore I James Madison. Present of the United States do issue this my proclamation exhorting all the good people thereof to unite their hearts and hands in giving effect to the ample means possessed for that purpose. I enjoin it on all officers civil and military to exert themselves in executing the duties with which they are respectively charged; and more especially I require the officers commanding the respective military districts to be vigilant and alert in proving for the defense thereof for the more effectual accomplishment of which they are authorized to call to the defense of exposed and threatened places portions of the militia most convenient thereto whether they be or be not parts of the quotas detached for the service of the United States under requisitions of the General Government.On an occasion which appeals so forcibly to the proud feelings and patriotic devotion of the American people none will forget what they owe to themselves what they owe to their country and the high destinies which await it what to the glory acquired by their fathers in establishing the independence which is now to be maintained by their sons with the augmented strength and resources with which time and Heaven had blessed them.In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents.Done at the city of Washington the 1st day of September A.D. 1814 and of the Independence of the United States the thirtyninth.JAMES MADISON.By the Present:JAMES MONROESecretary of State.  
Proceeding fellow citizens to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred upon me it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confence from my fellow citizens at large and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations. On taking this station on a former occasion I declared the principles on which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth. My conscience tells me that I have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every cand mind. In the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations and especially of those with which we have the most important relations. We have done them justice on all occasions favored where favor was lawful and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms. We are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with inuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties; and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is taken on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to brle others. At home fellow citizens you best know whether we have done well or ill. The suppression of unnecessary offices of useless establishments and expenses enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. These covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of produce and property. If among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient it was because their amount would not have pa the officers who collected them and because if they had any merit the state authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved. The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is pa cheerfully by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts being collected on our seaboards and frontiers only and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens it may be the pleasure and pre of an American to ask what farmer what mechanic what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the United States? These contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the government to fulfil contracts with foreign nations to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits to extend those limits and to apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their final redemption and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby liberated may by a just repartition among the states and a corresponding amendment of the constitution be applied _in time of peace_ to rivers canals roads arts manufactures education and other great objects within each state. _In time of war_ if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war increased as the same revenue will be increased by population and consumption and aed by other resources reserved for that crisis it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burdening them with the debts of the past. War will then be but a suspension of useful works and a return to a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement. I have sa fellow citizens that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits; but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest; in all events it will repay the advances we have made. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana has been disapproved by some from a cand apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union. But who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively? The larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions; and in any  is it not better that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family? With which shall we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse? In matters of religion I have consered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government. I have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it; but have left them as the constitution found them under the direction and discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies. The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the rights of men breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores; without power to ert or habits to contend against they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it; now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter's state humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals. We have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity; and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves. But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life to induce them to exercise their reason follow its dictates and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated by the habits of their bodies prejudice of their minds ignorance pre and the influence of interested and crafty inuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they d must be done through all time; that reason is a false gue and to advance under its counsel in their physical moral or political condition is perilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger; in short my friends among them is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and bigotry; they too have their antiphilosophers who find an interest in keeping things in their present state who dread reformation and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendency of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates. In giving these outlines I do not mean fellow citizens to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures; that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large who by the weight of public opinion influence and strengthen the public measures; it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confe the legislative duties; it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws the execution of which alone remains for others; and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries whose patriotism has associated with me in the executive s. During this course of administration and in order to disturb it the artillery of the press has been levelled against us charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare. These abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety; they might indeed have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved and proved by the laws of the several States against falsehood and defamation; but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation. Nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully made whether freedom of discussion unaed by power is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth  whether a government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution with zeal and purity and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness can be written down by falsehood and defamation. The experiment has been tried; you have witnessed the scene; our fellow citizens have looked on cool and collected; they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around their public aries and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage they pronounced their verdict honorable to those who had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes he may be intrusted with his own affairs. No inference is here intended that the laws proved by the State against false and defamatory publications should not be enforced; he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law; but the experiment is noted to prove that since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts the press confined to truth needs no other legal restraint; the public judgment will correct false reasonings and opinions on a full hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness. If there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion. Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course I offer to our country sincere congratulations. With those too not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength; facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them; and our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens with whom they cannot yet resolve to act as to principles and measures think as they think and desire what they desire; that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good that peace be cultivated civil and religious liberty unassailed law and order preserved; equality of rights maintained and that state of property equal or unequal which results to every man from his own industry or that of his fathers. When satisfied of these s it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them; in the meantime let us cherish them with patient affection; let us do them justice and more than justice in all competitions of interest; and we need not doubt that truth reason and their own interests will at length prevail will gather them into the fold of their country and will complete their entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength. I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray; I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice; but the weakness of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests. I shall need therefore all the indulgence I have heretofore experienced  the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years. I shall need too the favor of that Being in whose hands we are who led our forefathers as Israel of old from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with his provence and our riper years with his wisdom and power; and to whose goodness I ask you to join with me in supplications that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants gue their councils and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good and shall secure to you the peace friendship and approbation of all nations. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:When we assemble together fellow citizens to conser the state of our beloved country our just attentions are first drawn to those pleasing circumstances which mark the goodness of that Being from whose favor they flow and the large measure of thankfulness we owe for His bounty. Another year has come around and finds us still blessed with peace and friendship abroad; law order and religion at home; good affection and harmony with our Indian neighbors; our burthens lightened yet our income sufficient for the public wants and the produce of the year great beyond example. These fellow citizens are the circumstances under which we meet and we remark with special satisfaction those which under the smiles of Provence result from the skill industry and order of our citizens managing their own affairs in their own way and for their own use unembarrassed by too much regulation unoppressed by fiscal exactions.On the restoration of peace in Europe that portion of the general carrying trade which had fallen to our share during the war was abrged by the returning competition of the belligerent powers. This was to be expected and was just. But in addition we find in some parts of Europe monopolizing discriminations which in the form of duties tend effectually to prohibit the carrying thither our own produce in our own vessels. From existing amities and a spirit of justice it is hope that friendly discussion will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity. But should false calculations of interest defeat our hope it rests with the legislature to dece whether they will meet inequalities abroad with countervailing inequalities at home or prove for the evil in any other way.It is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British Parliament anticipating this subject so far as to authorize a mutual abolition of the duties and countervailing duties permitted under the treaty of 1794. It shows on their part a spirit of justice and friendly accommodation which it is our duty and our interest to cultivate with all nations. Whether this would produce a due equality in the igation between the two countries is a subject for your conseration.Another circumstances which claims attention as directly affecting the very source of our igation in the defect or the evasion of the law proving for the return of seamen and particularly of those belonging to vessels sold abroad. Numbers of them discharged in foreign ports have dangers into which their distresses might plunge them and save them to their country have found it necessary in some cases to return them at the public charge.The cession of the Spanish Province of Louisiana to France which took place in the course of the late war will if carried into effect make a change in the aspect of our foreign relations which will doubtless have just weight in any deliberations of the legislature connected with that subject.There was reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which we were engaged with Tripoli might be taken up by some other of the Barbary Powers. A reenforcement therefore was immediately ordered to the vessels already there. Subsequent information however has removed these apprehensions for the present. To secure our commerce in that sea with the smallest force competent we have supposed it best to watch strictly the harbor of Tripoli. Still however the shallowness of their coast and the want of smaller vessels on our part has permitted some cruisers to escape unobserved and to one of these an American vessel unfortunately fell a prey. The captain one American seaman and two others of color remain prisoners with them unless exchanged under an agreement formerly made with the Bashaw to whom on the faith of that some of his captive subjects had been restored.The convention with the state of Georgia has been ratified by their legislature and a repurchase from the Creeks has been consequently made of a part of the Talasscee country. In this purchase has been also comprehended a part of the lands within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers. The particulars of the contract will be la before Congress so soon as they shall be in a state for communication.In order to remove every ground of difference possible with our Indian neighbors I have proceeded in the work of settling with them and marking the boundaries between us. That with Choctaw Nation is fixed in one part and will be through the whole within a short time. The country to which their title had been extinguished before the Revolution is sufficient to receive a very respectful population which Congress will probably see the expediency of encouraging so soon as the limits shall be declared. We are to  this position as an outpost of the United States surrounded by strong neighbors and distant from its support; and how far that monopoly which prevents population should here be guarded against and actual habitation made a condition of the continuance of title will be for your conseration. A prompt settlement too of all existing rights and claims within this territory presents itself as a preliminary operation.In that part of the Indian Territory which includes Vicennes the lines settled with neighboring tribes fix the extinction of their title at a breadth of 24 leagues from east to west and about the same length parallel with and including the Wabash. They have also ceded a tract of four miles square including the salt springs near the mouth of that river.In the Department of Finance it is with pleasure I inform you that the receipts of external duties for the last twelve months have exceeded those of any former year and that the ratio of increase has been also greater than usual. This has enabled us to answer all the regular exigencies of government to pay from the Treasury within one year upward of $8000000 principal and interest of the public debt exclusive of upward of one million pa by the sale of bank stock and making in the whole a reduction of nearly five millions and a half of principal and to have now in the Treasury $4500000 which are in a course of application to the further discharge of debt and current demands. Experience too so far authorizes us to believe if no extraordinary event supervenes and the expenses which will be actually incurred shall not be greater than were cond by Congress at their last session that we shall not be disappointed in the expectations then formed. But nevertheless as the effect of peace on the amount of duties is not yet fully ascertained it is the more necessary to practice every useful economy and to incur no expense which may be avoed without prejudice.The collection of the internal taxes having been retarded it will be some time before the system is closed. It is not yet been thought necessary to employ the agent authorized by an act of the last session for transacting business in Europe relative to debts and loans. Nor have we used the power confed by the same act of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans and of redeeming instead thereof an equal sum of domestic debt. Should however the difficulties of remittance on so large a scale render it necessary at any time the power shall be executed and the money thus unemployed abroad shall in conformity with that law be faithfully applied here in equivalent extinction of domestic debt. When effects do salutary result from the plans you have already sanctioned; when merely by avoing false objects of expense we are able without a direct tax without internal taxes and without borrowing to make large and effectual payments toward the discharge of public debt and the emancipation of our posterity from that mortal canker it is an encouragement fellow citizens of the highest order to proceed as we have begun in substituting economy for taxation and in pursuing what is useful for a nation placed as we are rather than what is practiced by others under different circumstances. And whensoever we are destined to meet events which shall call forth all the energies of our countryman we have the firmest reliance on those energies and the comfort of leaving for calls like these the extraordinary resources of loans and internal taxes. In the meantime by payments of the principal of our debt we are liberating annually portions of the external taxes and forming from them a growing fund still further to lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary resources.The usual account of receipts and expenditures for the last year with an estimate of the expenses of the ensuing one will be la before you by the Secretary of Treasury.No change being deemed necessary in our military establishment an estimate of its expenses for the ensuing year on its present footing as also sums to be employed in fornications and other objects within that department has been prepared by the Secretary of War and will make a part of the general estimates which will be presented you.Consering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes and that the militia our general reliance for great and sudden emergencies you will doubtless think this institution worth of a re and give those improvements of which you find susceptible.Estimates for the Naval Department prepared by the Secretary of the Navy for another year will in like manner be communicated with general estimates. A small force in the Mediterranean will still be necessary to restrain the Tripoline cruisers and the uncertain tenure of peace with some other of the Barbary Powers may eventually require that force to be augmented. The necessity of procuring some smaller vessels for that service will raise the estimate but the difference in their maintenance will soon make it a measure of economy.Presuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a convenient sum toward proving the al defense which our situation may require. I can not but recommend that the first appropriations for that purpose may go to the saving what we already possess. No cares no attentions can preserve vessels from rap decay which lie in water exposed to the sun. These decays require great and constant repairs and will consume if continues a great portion of the moneys destined to al purposes. To avo this waste of our resources it is proposed to add to our y yard here a dock within which our present vessels may be la up dry and cover from the sun. Under these circumstances experience proves that works of wood will remain scarcely at all affected by time. The great abundance of running water which this situation possess at heights far above the level of the te if employed as is practiced for lock igation furnishes the means for raising and laying up our vessels on a dry and sheltered bed. And should the measure be found useful here similar depositories for laying up as well as for building and repairing vessel may hereafter be undertaken at other y yards offering the same means. The plans and estimates of the work prepared by a person of skill and experience will be presented to you without delay and from this it will be seen that scarcely more than has been the cost of one vessel is necessary to save the whole and that the annual sum to be employed toward its completion may be adapted to the s of the legislature as to al expenditure.To cultivate peace and maintain commerce and igation in all their lawful enterprises; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of igation and for the nurture of man and protect the manufactures adapted to our circumstances; to preserve the faith of the nation by an exact discharge of its debts and contracts expend the public money with same care and economy we would practice with our own and impose on our citizens no unnecessary burthens; to keep in all of safety—these fellow citizens are the landmarks by which we are to gue ourselves in all our proceedings. By continuing to make these the rule of our action we shall endear to our countrymen the true principles of their Constitution and promote an union of sentiment an of action equally auspicious to their happiness and safety. On my part you may count on a cordial concurrence in every measure for the public good and on all the information I possess which may enable you to discharge to advantage the high s with which you are invested by your country. 
 To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:  Circumstances fellowcitizens which seriously threatened the peace of our country have made it a duty to convene you at an earlier period than usual. The love of peace so much cherished in the bosoms of our citizens which has so long gued the proceedings of their public councils and induced forbearance under so many wrongs may not insure our continuance in the quiet pursuits of industry. The many injuries and depredations committed on our commerce and igation upon the high seas for years past the successive innovations on those principles of public law which have been established by the reason and usage of nations and peace and all the circumstances which induced the extraordinary mission to London are already known to you. The instructions given to our ministers were framed in the sincerest spirit of amity and moderation. They accordingly proceeded in conformity therewith to propose arrangements which might embrace and settle all the points in difference between us to a mutual understanding on our neutral and national rights prove for a commercial intercourse on conditions of some equality. After long and fruitless endeavors to effect the purposes of their mission and to obtain arrangements within the limits of their instructions they concluded to sign such as could be obtained and to send them for conseration candly declaring to the other negotiations at the same time that they were acting against their instructions and that their Government therefore could not be pledged for ratification. Some of the articles proposed might have been admitted on a principle of compromise but others were too highly disadvantageous and no sufficient provision was made against the principle source of the irritations and collisions which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations. The question therefore whether a treaty should be accepted in that form could have admitted but of one decision even had no declarations of the other party impaired our confence in it. Still anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment new modifications were framed and further concessions authorized than could before have been supposed necessary; and our ministers were instructed to resume their negotiations on these grounds. On this new reference to amicable discussion we were reposing in confence when on the 22d day of June last by a formal order from British admiral the frigate Cheapeake leaving her port for a distant service was attacked by one of those vessels which had been lying in our harbors under the indulgences of hospitality was disabled from proceeding had several of her crew killed and four taken away. On this outrage no commentaries are necessary. Its character has been pronounced by the indignant voice of our citizens with an emphasis and unanimity never exceeded. I immediately by proclamation interdicted our harbors and waters to all British armed vessels forbade intercourse with them and uncertain how far hostilities were intended and the town of Norfolk indeed being threatened with immediate attack a sufficient force was ordered for the protection of that place and such other preparations commenced and pursued as the prospect rendered proper. An armed vessel of the United States was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at London to call on that Government for the satisfaction and security required by the outrage. A very short interval ought now to bring the answer which shall be communicated to you as soon as received; then also or as soon after as the public interests shall be found to admit; the unratified treaty and proceedings relative to it shall be made known to you. The aggression thus begun has been continued on the part of the British commanders by remaining within our waters in defiance of the authority of the country by habitual violations of its jurisdiction and at length by putting to death one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on board the Chesapeake. These aggravations necessarily lead to the policy either of never admitting an armed vessel into our harbors or of maintaining in every harbor such an armed force as may constrain obedience to the laws and protect the lives and property of our citizens against their armed guests; but the expense of such a standing force and its inconsistence with our principles dispense with those courtesies which would necessarily call for it and leave us equally free to exclude the y as we are the army of a foreign power from entering our limits.To former violations of maritime rights another is now added of very extensive effect. The Government of that nation has issued an order interdicting all trade by neutrals between ports not in amity with them; and being now at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas our vessels are required to sacrifice their cargos at the first port they touch or to return home without the benefit of going to any other market. Under this new law of the ocean our trade on the Mediterranean has been swept away by seizures and condemnations and that in other seas is threatened with the same fate.Our differences with Spain remain still unsettled no measure having been taken on her part since my last communications to Congress to bring them to a close. But under a state of things which may favor reconseration they have been recently pressed and an expectation is entertained that they may now soon be brought to an issue of some sort. With their subjects on our borders no new collisions have taken place nor seem immediately to be apprehended. To our former grounds of complaint has been added a very serious one as you will see by the decree a copy of which is now communicated. Whether this decree which professed to be conformable to that of the French Government of November 21 1806 heretofore communicated to Congress will also be conformed to that in its construction and application in relation to the United States had not been ascertained at the date of our last communications. These however gave reason to expect such a conformity.With the other nations of Europe our harmony has ben uninterrupted and commerce and friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual footing.Our peace with the several states on the coast of Barbary appears as firm as at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other nation.Among our Indian neighbors in the northwestern quarter some fermentation was observed soon after the late occurences threatening the continuance of our peace. Messages were sa to be interchanged and tokens to be passing which usually denote a state of restlessness among them and the character of the agitators pointed to the sources of excitement. Measures were immediately taken for proving against that danger; instructions were given to require explanations and with assurances of our continued friendship to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home taking no part in quarrels not belonging o them. As far as we are yet informed the tribes in our vicinity who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with us and to their peace with all others while those more remote do not present appearances sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military precaution on our part.The great tribes on our southwestern quarter much advanced beyond the others in agriculture and household arts appear tranquil and entifying their s with ours in proportion to their advancement. With the whole of these people in every quarter I shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship with all their neighbors and perseverance in those occupations and pursuits which will best promote their own wellbeing.The appropriations of the last session for the defense of our seaport towns and harbors were made under expectation that a continuance of peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience. It has been thought better to apply the sums then given toward the defense of New York Charleston and New Orleans chiefly as most open and most likely first to need protection and to leave places less immediately in danger to the provisions of the present session.The gunboats too already proved have on a like principle been chiefly assigned to New York New Orleans and the Chesapeake. Whether our movable force on th e water so material in a of the defensive works on the land should be augmented in this or any other form is left to the wisdom of the Legislature. For the purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attacks on our harbors it is a matter for conseration whether the seamen of the United States may not justly be formed into a special militia to be called on for tours of duty in defense of the harbors where they shall happen to be the ordinary militia of the place furnishing that portion which may consist of landsmen.The moment our peace was threatened I deemed it indispensable to secure a greater provision of those articles of military stores with which our magazines were not sufficiently furnished. To have awaited a previous and special sanction by law would have lost occasions which might not be retrieved. I d not hesitate therefore to authorize engagements for such supplements to our existing stock would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us and I trust that the legislature feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our country so materially advanced by this precaution will approve when done what they would have seen so important to be done if then assembled. Expenses also unproved for arose out of the necessity of calling all our gunboats into actual service for the defense of our harbors; of all which accounts will be la before you.When a regular army is to be raised and to what extent must depend on the information so shortly expected. In the meantime I have called on the States for quotas of militia to be in readiness for present defense and have moreover encouraged the acceptance of volunteers; and I am happy to inform you that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in every part of the Union. They are ordered to be organized and ready at a moment's warning to proceed on any service to which they may be called and every preparation within the Executive powers has been made to insure us the benefit of earl exertions.I informed Congress at their last session of the enterprises against the public peace which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and his associates of the measures taken to defeat them and to bring the offenders to justice. Their enterprises were happily defeated by the patriotic exertions of the militias whenever called into action by the felity of the Army and energy of the commander in chief in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves on the Sabine repairing to meet those arising on the Mississippi  and dissipating before their explosion plots engendering there. I shall think it my duty to lay before you the proceedings and the evence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the principle offenders before the circuit court of Virginia. You will be enabled to judge whether the defect was in the testimony in the law or in the administration of the law; and whenever it shall be found the Legislation alone can apply or originate the remedy. The framers of our Constitution certainly supposed they had guarded as well their Government against destruction by treason as their citizens against oppression under pretense of it and if these ends are not attained it is of importance to inquire by what means more effectual they may be secured.The accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on the 30th day of September last being not yet made up a correct statement will be hereafter transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near $16000000which with the five millions and a half in the Treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting the current demands and interest incurred to pay more than four millions of the principle of our funded debt. These payments with those of the preceding five and a half years have extinguished of the funded debt $25500000 being the whole which could be pa or purchased within the limits of the law and of our contracts and have left us in the Treasury $8500000. A portion of this sum may be consered as a commencement of accumulation of the surpluses of revenue which after paying the installments of debt as they shall become payable will remain without any specific object. It may partly indeed be applied toward completing the defense of the exposed points of our country on such a scale as shall be adapted to our principles and circumstances. This object is doubtless among the first entitled to attention in such a state of our finances and it is one which whether we have peace or war will prove security where it is due. Whether what shall remain of this with the future surpluses may be usefully applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully to others requiring new authorities or how otherwise they shall be disposed of are questions calling for the notice of Congress unless indeed they shall be superceded by a change in our public relations now awaiting the determination of others. Whatever be that determination it is a great consolation that it will become known at a moment when the supreme council of the nation is assembled at its post and ready to give the as of its wisdom and authority to whatever course the good of our country shall then call us to pursue.Matters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications and nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give information or dispatch to the proceedings of the Legislature in the excercise of their high duties and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare.
MY CHILDREN THE WOLF AND PEOPLE OF THE MANDAN NATION: I take you by the hand of friendship hearty welcome to the seat of the government of the United States. The journey which you have taken to visit your fathers on this se of our island is a long one and your having undertaken it is a proof that you desired to become acquainted with us. I thank the Great Spirit that he has protected you through the journey and brought you safely to the resence of your friends and I hope will have you constantly in his safe keeping and restore you in good health to your nations and families. My friends and children we are descended from the old nations which live beyond the great water but we and our forefathers have been so long here that we seem like you to have grown out of this land. We conser ourselves no longer of the old nations beyond the great water but as united in one family with our red brethren here. The French the English the Spaniards have now agreed with us to retire from all the country which you and we hold between Canada and Mexico and never more to return to it. And remember the words I now speak to you my children they are never to return again. We are now your fathers; and you shall not lose by the change. As soon as Spain had agreed to withdraw from all the waters of the Missouri and Mississippi I felt the desire of becoming acquainted with all my red children beyond the Mississippi and of uniting them with us as we have those on this se of that river in the bonds of peace and friendship. I wished to learn what we could do to benefit them by furnishing them the necessaries they want in exchange for their furs and peltries. I therefore sent our beloved man Captain Lewis one of my own family to go up the Missouri river to get acquainted with all the Indian nations in its neighborhood to take them by the hand deliver my talks to them and to inform us in what way we could be useful to them. Your nation received him kindly you have taken him by the hand and been friendly to him. My children I thank you for the services you rendered him and for your attention to his words. will now tell us where we should establish trading houses to be convenient to you all and what we must send to them. My friends and children I have now an important advice to give you. I have already told you that you and all the red men are my children and I wish you to live in peace and friendship with one another as brethren of the same family ought to do. How much better is it for neighbors to help than to hurt one another; how much happier must it make them. If you will cease to make war on one another if you will live in friendship with all mankind you can employ all your time in proving food and clothing for yourselves and your families. Your men will not be destroyed in war and your women and children will lie down to sleep in their cabins without fear of being surprised by their enemies and killed or carried away. Your numbers will be increased instead of diminishing and you will live in plenty and in quiet. My children I have given this advice to all your red brethren on this se of the Mississippi; they are following it they are increasing in their numbers are learning to clothe and prove for their families as we do. Remember then my advice my children carry it home to your people and tell them that from the day that they have become all of the same family from the day that we became father to them all we wish as a true father should do that we may all live together as one household and that before they strike one another they should go to their father and let him endeavor to make up the quarrel. My children you are come from the other se of our great island from where the sun sets to see your new friends at the sun rising. You have now arrived where the waters are constantly rising and falling every day but you are still distant from the sea. I very much desire that you should not stop here but go and see your brethren as far as the edge of the great water. I am persuaded you have so far seen that every man by the way has received you as his brothers and has been ready to do you all the kindness in his power. You will see the same thing quite to the sea shore; and I wish you therefore to go and visit our great cities in that quarter and see how many friends and brothers you have here. You will then have travelled a long line from west to east and if you had time to go from north to south from Canada to Flora you would find it as long in that direction and all the people as sincerely your friends. I wish you my children to see all you can and to tell your people all you see; because I am sure the more they know of us the more they will be our hearty friends. I invite you therefore to pay a visit to Baltimore Philadelphia New York and the cities still beyond that if you are willing to go further. We will prove carriages to convey you and a person to go with you to see that you want for nothing. By the time you come back the snows will be melted on the mountains the ice in the rivers broken up and you will be wishing to set out on your return home. My children I have long desired to see you; I have now opened my heart to you let my words sink into your hearts and never be forgotten. If ever lying people or bad spirits should raise up clouds between us call to mind what I have sa and what you have seen yourselves. Be sure there are some lying spirits between us; let us come together as friends and explain to each other what is misrepresented or misunderstood the clouds will fly away like morning fog and the sun of friendship appear and shine forever bright and clear between us. My children it may happen that while you are here occasion may arise to talk about many things which I do not now particularly mention. The Secretary at War will always be ready to talk with you and you are to conser whatever he says as sa by myself. will also take care of you and see that you are furnished with all comforts here. 
To the Senate of the United States: Having bestowed on the bill entitled An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States of America that full conseration which is due to the great importance of the subject and dictated by the respect which I feel for the two Houses of Congress I am constrained by a deep and solemn conviction that the bill ought not to become a law to return it to the Senate in which it originated with my objections to the same.Waiving the question of the constitutional authority of the Legislature to establish an incorporated bank as being precluded in my judgment by repeated recognitions under varied circumstances of the vality of such an institution in acts of the legislative executive and judicial branches of the Government accompanied by indications in different modes of a concurrence of the general will of the nation the proposed bank does not appear to be calculated to answer the purposes of reviving the public credit of proving a national medium of circulation and of aing the Treasury by facilitating the indispensable anticipations of the revenue and by affording to the public more durable loans.1. The capital of the bank is to be compounded of specie of public stocks and of Treasury notes convertible into stock with a certain proportion of each of which every subscriber is to furnish himself.The amount of the stock to be subscribed will not it is believed be sufficient to produce in favor of the public credit any conserable or lasting elevation of the market price whilst this may be occasionally depressed by the bank itself if it should carry into the market the allowed proportion of its capital consisting of public stock in order to procure specie which it may find its account in procuring with some sacrifice on that part of its capital.Nor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the subscription of Treasury notes. The actual issue of these notes nearly equals at present and will soon exceed the amount to be subscribed to the bank. The direct effect of this operation is simply to convert fifteen millions of Treasury notes into fifteen millions of 6 per cent stock with the collateral effect of promoting an additional demand for Treasury notes beyond what might otherwise be negotiable.Public credit might indeed be expected to derive advantage from the establishment of a national bank without regard to the formation of its capital if the full a and cooperation of the institution were secured to the Government during the war and during the period of its fiscal embarrassments. But the bank proposed will be free from all legal obligation to cooperate with the public measures and whatever might be the patriotic disposition of its directors to contribute to the removal of those embarrassments and to invigorate the prosecution of the war felity to the pecuniary and general interest of the institution according to their estimate of it might oblige them to decline a connection of their operations with those of the National Treasury during the continuance of the war and the difficulties incent to it. Temporary sacrifices of interest though overbalanced by the future and permanent profits of the charter not being requirable of right in behalf of the public might not be gratuitously made and the bank would reap the full benefit of the grant whilst the public would lose the equivalent expected from it; for it must be kept in  that the sole inducement to such a grant on the part of the public would be the prospect of substantial as to its pecuniary means at the present crisis and during the sequel of the war. It is event that the stock of the bank will on the return of peace if not sooner rise in the market to a value which if the bank were established in a period of peace would authorize and obtain for the public a bonus to a very large amount. In lieu of such a bonus the Government is fairly entitled to and ought not to relinquish or risk the needful services of the bank under the pressing circumstances of war.2. The bank as proposed to be constituted can not be relied on during the war to prove a circulating medium nor to furnish loans or anticipations of the public revenue.Without a medium the taxes can not be collected and in the absence of specie the medium understood to be the best substitute is that of notes issued by a national bank. The proposed bank will commence and conduct its operations under an obligation to pay its notes in specie or be subject to the loss of its charter. Without such an obligation the notes of the bank though not exchangeable for specie yet resting on good pledges and performing the uses of specie in the payment of taxes and in other public transactions would as experience has ascertained qualify the bank to supply at once a circulating medium and pecuniary as to the Government. Under the fetters imposed by the bill it is manifest that during the actual state of things and probably during the war the period particularly requiring such a medium and such a resource for loans and advances to the Government notes for which the bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange could not be kept in circulation. The most the bank could effect and the most it could be expected to aim at would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local transactions which with the interest on the public stock in the bank might yield a end sufficient for the purpose until a change from war to peace should enable it by a flow of specie into its vaults and a removal of the external demand for it to derive its cond emoluments from a safe and full extension of its operations.On the whole when it is consered that the proposed establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a national bank for a period of twenty years; that the monopolized profits will be continually growing with the progress of the national population and wealth; that the nation will during the same period be dependent on the notes of the bank for that species of circulating medium whenever the precious metals may be wanted and at all times for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium and that the extensive employment of the notes in the collection of the augmented taxes will moreover enable the bank greatly to extend its profitable issues of them without the expense of specie capital to support their circulation it is as reasonable as it is requisite that the Government in return for these extraordinary concessions to the bank should have a greater security for attaining the public objects of the institution than is presented in the bill and particularly for every practicable accommodation both in the temporary advances necessary to anticipate the taxes and in those more durable loans which are equally necessary to diminish the resort to taxes.In discharging this painful duty of stating objections to a measure which has undergone the deliberations and received the sanction of the two Houses of the National Legislature I console myself with the reflection that if they have not the weight which I attach to them they can be constitutionally overruled and with a confence that in a contrary event the wisdom of Congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigencies.JAMES MADISON.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:In communicating to you a just  of public affairs at the commencement of your present labors I do it with great satisfaction because taking all circumstances into conseration which claim attention I see much cause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation. In making this remark I do not wish to be understood to imply that an unvaried prosperity is to be seen in every interest of this great community. In the progress of a nation inhabiting a territory of such vast extent and great variety of climate every portion of which is engaged in foreign commerce and liable to be affected in some degree by the changes which occur in the condition and regulations of foreign countries it would be strange if the produce of our soil and the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens received at all times and in every quarter an uniform and equal encouragement. This would be more than we would have a right to expect under circumstances the most favorable. Pressures on certain interests it is admitted have been felt; but allowing to these their greatest extent they detract but little from the force of the remarks already made. In forming a just estimate of our present situation it is proper to look at the whole in the outline as well as in the detail. A free virtuous and enlightened people know well the great principles and causes on which their happiness depends and even those who suffer most occasionally in their transitory concerns find great relief under their sufferings from the blessings which they otherwise enjoy and in the consoling and animating hope which they administer. From whence do these pressures come? Not from a Government which is founded by administered for and supported by the people. We trace them to the peculiar character of the epoch in which we live and to the extraordinary occurrences which have signalized it. The convulsions with which several of the powers of Europe have been shaken and the long and destructive wars in which all were engaged with their sudden transition to a state of peace presenting in the 1st instance unusual encouragement to our commerce and withdrawing it in the second even within its wonted limit could not fail to be sensibly felt here. The station too which we had to support through this long conflict compelled as we were finally to become a party to it with a principal power and to make great exertions suffer heavy losses and to contract conserable debts disturbing the ordinary course of affairs by augmenting to a vast amount the circulating medium and thereby elevating at one time the price of every article above a just standard and depressing it at another below it had likewise its due effect. It is manifest that the pressures of which we complain have proceeded in a great measure from these causes. When then we take into  the prosperous and happy condition of our country in all the great circumstances which constitute the felicity of a nation  every inual in the full enjoyment of all his rights the Union blessed with plenty and raply rising to greatness under a National Government which operates with complete effect in every part without being felt in any except by the ample protection which it affords and under State governments which perform their equal share according to a wise distribution of power between them in promoting the public happiness  it is impossible to behold so gratifying so glorious a spectacle without being penetrated with the most profound and grateful acknowledgments to the Supreme Author of All Good for such manifold and inestimable blessings. Deeply impressed with these sentiments I can not regard the pressures to which I have adverted otherwise than in the light of mild and instructive admonitions warning us of dangers to be shunned in future teaching us lessons of economy corresponding with the simplicity and purity of our institutions and best adapted to their support evincing the connection and dependence which the various parts of our happy Union have on each other thereby augmenting daily our social incorporation and adding by its strong ties new strength and vigor to the political; opening a wer range and with new encouragement to the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens at home and abroad and more especially by the multiplied proofs which it has accumulated of the great perfection of our most excellent system of Government the powerful instrument in the hands of our Allmerciful Creator in securing to us these blessings. Happy as our situation is it does not exempt us from solicitude and care for the future. On the contrary as the blessings which we enjoy are great proportionably great should be our vigilance zeal and activity to preserve them. Foreign wars may again expose us to new wrongs which would impose on us new duties for which we ought to be prepared. The state of Europe is unsettled and how long peace may be preserved is altogether uncertain; in addition to which we have interests of our own to adjust which will require particular attention. A correct  of our relations with each power will enable you to form a just ea of existing difficulties and of the measures of precaution best adapted to them. Respecting our relations with Spain nothing explicit can now be communicated. On the adjournment of Congress in May last the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madr was instructed to inform the Government of Spain that if His Catholic Majesty should then ratify the treaty this Government would accept the ratification so far as to submit to the decision of the Senate the question whether such ratification should be received in exchange for that of the United States heretofore given. By letters from the minister of the United States to the Secretary of State it appears that a communication in conformity with his instructions had been made to the Government of Spain and that the Cortes had the subject under conseration. The result of the deliberations of that body which is daily expected will be made known to Congress as soon as it is received. The friendly sentiment which was expressed on the part of the United States in the message of the 9th of May last is still entertained for Spain. Among the causes of regret however which are inseparable from the delay attending this transaction it is proper to state that satisfactory information has been received that measures have been recently adopted by designing persons to convert certain parts of the Province of East Flora into depots for the reception of foreign goods from whence to smuggle them into the United States. By opening a port within the limits of Flora immediately on our boundary where there was no settlement the object could not be misunderstood. An early accommodation of differences will it is hoped prevent all such fraudulent and pernicious practices and place the relations of the two countries on a very amicable and permanent basis. The commercial relations between the United States and the British colonies in the West Indies and on this continent have undergone no change the British Government still preferring to leave that commerce under the restriction heretofore imposed on it on each se. It is satisfactory to recollect that the restraints resorted to by the United States were defensive only intended to prevent a monopoly under British regulations in favor of Great Britain as it likewise is to know that the experiment is advancing in a spirit of amity between the parties. The question depending between the United States and Great Britain respecting the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent has been referred by both Governments to the decision of the Emperor of Russia who has accepted the umpirage. An attempt has been made with the Government of France to regulate by treaty the commerce between the two countries on the principle of reciprocity and equality. By the last communication from the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris to whom full power had been given we learn that the negotiation has been commenced there; but serious difficulties having occurred the French Government had resolved to transfer it to the United States for which purpose the minister plenipotentiary of France had been ordered to repair to this city and whose arrival might soon be expected. It is hoped that this important interest may be arranged on just conditions and in a manner equally satisfactory to both parties. It is submitted to Congress to dece until such arrangement is made how far it may be proper on the principle of the act of the last session which augmented the tonnage duty on French vessels to adopt other measures for carrying more completely into effect the policy of that act. The act referred to which imposed new tonnage on French vessels having been in force from and after the first day of July it has happened that several vessels of that nation which had been dispatched from France before its existence was known have entered the ports of the United States and been subject to its operation without that previous notice which the general spirit of our laws gives to inuals in similar cases. The object of that law having been merely to countervail the inequalities which existed to the disadvantage of the United States in their commercial intercourse with France it is submitted also to the conseration of Congress whether in the spirit of amity and conciliation which it is no less the inclination than the policy of the United States to preserve in their intercourse with other powers it may not be proper to extend relief to the inuals interested in those cases by exempting from the operation of the law all those vessels which have entered our ports without having had the means of previously knowing the existence of the additional duty. The contest between Spain and the colonies according to the most authentic information is maintained by the latter with improved success. The unfortunate isions which were known to exist some time since at Buenos Ayres it is understood still prevail. In no part of South America has Spain made any impression on the colonies while in many parts and particularly in Venezuela and New Grenada the colonies have gained strength and acquired reputation both for the management of the war in which they have been successful and for the order of the internal administration. The late change in the Government of Spain by the reestablishment of the constitution of 1812 is an event which promises to be favorable to the revolution. Under the authority of the Cortes the Congress of Angostura was invited to open a negotiation for the settlement of differences between the parties to which it was replied that they would willingly open the negotiation proved the acknowledgment of their independence was made its basis but not otherwise. No facts are known to this Government to warrant the belief that any of the powers of Europe will take part in the contest whence it may be inferred consering all circumstances which must have weight in producing the result that an adjustment will finally take place on the basis proposed by the colonies. To promote that result by friendly counsels with other powers including Spain herself has been the uniform policy of this Government. In looking to the internal concerns of our country you will I am persuaded derive much satisfaction from a  of the several objects to which in the discharge of your official duties your attention will be drawn. Among these none holds a more important place than the public revenue from the direct operation of the power by which it is raised on the people and by its influence in giving effect to every other power of the Government. The revenue depends on the resources of the country and the facility by which the amount required is raised is a strong proof of the extent of the resources and of the efficiency of the Government. A few prominent facts will place this great interest in a just light before you. On [18150930] the funded and floating debt of the United States was estimated at $119635558. If to this sum be added the amount of 5% stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States the amount of Mississippi stock and of the stock which was issued subsequently to that date and as afterwards liquated to $158713049. On [18200930] it amounted to $91993883 having been reduced in that interval by payments $66879165. During this term the expenses of the Government of the United States were likewise defrayed in every branch of the civil military and al establishments; the public edifices in this city have been rebuilt with conserable additions; extensive fortifications have been commenced and are in a train of execution; permanent arsenals and magazines have been erected in various parts of the Union; our Navy has been conserably augmented and the ordnance munitions of war and stores of the Army and Navy which were much exhausted during the war have been replenished. By the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the execution of such extensive and important operations in so short a time a just estimate may be formed of the great extent of our national resources. The demonstration is the more complete and gratifying when it is recollected that the direct tax and excise were repealed soon after the termination of the late war and that the revenue applied to these purposes has been derived almost wholly from other sources. The receipts into the Treasury from every source to the 30th of September last have amounted to $16794107.66 whilst the public expenditures to the same period amounted to $16871534.72 leaving in the Treasury on that day a sum estimated at $1.95M. for the probable receipts of the following year I refer you to the statement which will be transmitted from the Treasury. The sum of $3M authorized to be raised by loan by an act of the last session of Congress has been obtained upon terms advantageous to the Government indicating not only an increased confence in the faith of the nation but the existence of a large amount of capital seeking that mode of investment at a rate of interest not exceeding 5% per annum. It is proper to add that there is now due to the Treasury for the sale of public lands $22996545. In bringing this subject to  I conser it my duty to submit to Congress whether it may not be advisable to extend to the purchasers of these lands in conseration of the unfavorable change which has occurred since the sales a reasonable indulgence. It is known that the purchases were made when the price of every article had risen to its greatest height and the installments are becoming due at a period of great depression. It is presumed that some plan may be devised by the wisdom of Congress compatible with the public interest which would afford great relief to these purchasers. Conserable progress has been made during the present season in examining the coast and its various bays and other inlets in the collection of materials and in the construction of fortifications for the defense of the Union at several of the positions at which it has been deced to erect such works. At Mobile Point and Dauphin Island and at the Rigolets leading to Lake Pontchartrain materials to a conserable amount have been collected and all the necessary preparations made for the commencement of the works. At Old Point Comfort at the mouth of the James River and at the RipRap on the opposite shore in the Chesapeake Bay materials to a vast amount have been collected; and at the Old Point some progress has been made in the construction of the fortification which is on a very extensive scale. The work at Fort Washington on this river will be completed early in the next spring and that on the Pea Patch in the Delaware in the course of the next season. Fort Diamond at the Narrows in the harbor of NY will be finished this year. The works at Boston NY Baltimore Norfolk Charleston and Niagara have been in part repaired and the coast of NC extending south to Cape Fear has been examined as have likewise other parts of the coast eastward of Boston. Great exertions have been made to push forward these works with the utmost dispatch possible; but when their extent is consered with the important purposes for which they are intended  the defense of the whole coast and in consequence of the whole interior  and that they are to last for ages it will be manifest that a well digested plan founded on military principles connecting the whole together combining security with economy could not be prepared without repeated examinations of the most exposed and difficult parts and that it would also take conserable time to collect the materials at the several points where they would be required. From all the light that has been shed on this subject I am satisfied that every favorable anticipation which has been formed of this great undertaking will be verified and that when completed it will afford very great if not complete protection to our Atlantic frontier in the event of another war  protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign with an enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these works without taking into the estimate the saving of the lives of so many of our citizens the protection of our towns and other property or the tendency of such works to prevent war. Our military positions have been maintained at Belle Point on the Arkansas at Council Bluffs on the Missouri at St. Peters on the Mississippi and at Green Bay on the upper Lakes. Commodious barracks have already been erected at most of these posts with such works as were necessary for their defense. Progress has also been made in opening communications between them and in raising supplies at each for the support of the troops by their own labor particularly those most remote. With the Indians peace has been preserved and a progress made in carrying into effect the act of Congress making an appropriation for their civilization with the prospect of favorable results. As connected equally with both these objects our trade with those tribes is thought to merit the attention of Congress. In their original state game is their sustenance and war their occupation and if they find no employment from civilized powers they destroy each other. Left to themselves their extirpation is inevitable. By a judicious regulation of our trade with them we supply their wants administer to their comforts and gradually as the game retires draw them to us. By maintaining posts far in the interior we acquire a more thorough and direct control over them without which it is confently believed that a complete change in their manners can never be accomplished. By such posts aed by a proper regulation of our trade with them and a judicious civil administration over them to be proved for by law we shall it is presumed be enabled not only to protect our own settlements from their savage incursions and preserve peace among the several tribes but accomplish also the great purpose of their civilization. Conserable progress has also been made in the construction of ships of war some of which have been launched in the course of the present year. Our peace with the powers on the coast of Barbary has been preserved but we owe it altogether to the presence of our squadron in the Mediterranean. It has been found equally necessary to employ some of our vessels for the protection of our commerce in the Indian Sea the Pacific and along the Atlantic coast. The interests which we have depending in those quarters which have been much improved of late are of great extent and of high importance to the nation as well as to the parties concerned and would undoubtedly suffer if such protection was not extended to them. In execution of the law of the last session for the suppression of the slave trade some of our public ships have also been employed on the coast of Africa where several captures have already been made of vessels engaged in that disgraceful traffic. 
Fellow citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:If the enjoyment in profusion of the bounties of Provence forms a suitable subject of mutual gratulation and grateful acknowledgment we are admonished at this return of the season when the representatives of the nation are assembled to deliberate upon their concerns to offer up the tribute of fervent and grateful hearts for the never failing mercies of Him who ruleth over all. has again favored us with healthful seasons and abundant harvests; has sustained us in peace with foreign countries and in tranquillity within our borders; has preserved us in the quiet and undisturbed possession of civil and religious liberty; has crowned the year with His goodness imposing on us no other condition than of improving for our own happiness the blessings bestowed by His hands and in the fruition of all His favors of devoting his faculties with which we have been endowed by Him to His glory and to our own temporal and eternal welfare.In the relations of our federal union with our brethren of the human race the changes which have occurred since the close of your last session have generally tended to the preservation of peace and to the cultivation of harmony. Before your last separation a war had unhappily been kindled between the Empire of Russia one of those with which our intercourse has been no other than a constant exchange of good offices and that of the Ottoman Porte a nation from which geographical distance religious opinions and maxims of government on their part little suited to the formation of those bonds of mutual benevolence which result from the benefits of commerce had department us in a state perhaps too much prolonged of coldness and alienation.The extensive fertile and populous dominions of the Sultan belong rather to the Asiatic than the European ision of the human family. They enter but partially into the system of Europe nor have their wars with Russia and Austria the European States upon which they border for more than a century past disturbed the pacific relations of those States with the other great powers of Europe. Neither France nor Prussia nor Great Britain has ever taken part in them nor is it to be expected that they will at this time. The declaration of war by Russia has received the approbation or acquiescence of her allies and we may indulge the hope that its progress and termination will be signalized by the moderation and forbearance no less than by the energy of the Emperor Nicholas and that it will afford the opportunity for such collateral agency in behalf of the suffering Greeks as will secure to them ultimately the triumph of humanity and of freedom.The state of our particular relations with France has scarcely varied in the course of the present year. The commercial intercourse between the two countries has continued to increase for the mutual benefit of both. The claims of indemnity to numbers of our fellow citizens for depredations upon their property heretofore committed during the revolutionary governments remain unadjusted and still form the subject of earnest representation and remonstrance. Recent advices from the minister of the United States at Paris encourage the expectation that the appeal to the justice of the French government will ere long receive a favorable conseration.The last friendly expedient has been resorted to for the decision of the controversy with Great Britain relating to the northeastern boundary of the United States. By an agreement with the British government carrying into effect the provisions of the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent and the convention of 18270929 His Majesty the King of the Netherlands has by common consent been selected as the umpire between the parties. The proposal to him to accept the designation for the performance of this friendly office will be made at an early day and the United States relying upon the justice of their cause will cheerfully commit the arbitrament of it to a prince equally distinguished for the independence of his spirit his indefatigable assuity to the duties of his station and his inflexible personal probity.Our commercial relations with Great Britain will deserve the serious conseration of Congress and the exercise of a conciliatory and forbearing spirit in the policy of both governments. The state of them has been materially changed by the act of Congress passed at their last session in alteration of several acts imposing duties on imports and by acts of more recent date of the British Parliament. The effect of the interdiction of direct trade commenced by Great Britain and reciprocated by the United States has been as was to be foreseen only to substitute different channels for an exchange of commodities indispensable to the colonies and profitable to a numerous  of our fellow citizens. The exports the revenue the igation of the United States have suffered no diminution by our exclusion from direct access to the British colonies. The colonies pay more dearly for the necessaries of life which their government burdens with the charges of double voyages freight insurance and commission and the profits of our exports are somewhat impaired and more injuriously transferred from one portion of our citizens to another.The resumption of this old and otherwise exploded system of colonial exclusion has not secured to the shipping interest of Great Britain the relief which at the expense of the distant colonies and of the United States it was expected to afford. Other measures have been resorted to more pointedly bearing upon the igation of the United States and more pointedly bearing upon the igation of the United States and which unless modified by the construction given to the recent acts of Parliament will be manifestly incompatible with the positive stipulations of the commercial convention existing between the two countries. That convention however may be terminated with 12 months' notice at the option of either party.A treaty of amity igation and commerce between the United States and His Majesty the Emperor of Austria King of Hungary and Bohemia has been prepared for signature by the Secretary of State and by the Baron de Lederer intrusted with full powers of the Austrian government. Independently of the new and friendly relations which may be thus commenced with one of the most eminent and powerful nations of the earth the occasion has been taken in it as in other recent treaties concluded by the United States to extend those principles of liberal intercourse and of fair reciprocity which intertwine with the exchanges of commerce the principles of justice and the feelings of mutual benevolence.This system first proclaimed to the world in the first commercial treaty ever concluded by the United States—that of 17780206 with France—has been invariably the cherished policy of our Union. It is by treaties of commerce alone that it can be made ultimately to prevail as the established system of all civilized nations. With this principle our fathers extended the hand of friendship to every nation of the globe and to this policy our country has ever since adhered. What ever of regulation in our laws has ever been adopted unfavorable to the interest of any foreign nation has been essentially defensive and counteracting to similar regulations of theirs operating against us.Immediately after the close of the War of Independence commissioners were appointed by the Congress of the Confederation authorized to conclude treaties with every nation of Europe disposed to adopt them. Before the wars of the French Revolution such treaties had been consummated with the United Netherlands Sweden and Prussia. During those wars treaties with Great Britain and Spain had been effected and those with Prussia and France renewed. In all these some concessions to the liberal principles of intercourse proposed by the United States had been obtained; but as in all the negotiations they came occasionally in collision with previous internal regulations or exclusive and excluding compacts of monopoly with which the other parties had been trammeled the advances made in them toward the freedom of trade were partial and imperfect. Colonial establishments chartered companies and ship building influence pervaded and encumbered the legislation of all the great commercial states; and the United States in offering free trade and equal privilege to all were compelled to acquiesce in many exceptions with each of the parties to their treaties accommodated to their existing laws and anterior agreements.The colonial system by which this whole hemisphere was bound has fallen into ruins totally abolished by revolutions converting colonies into independent nations throughout the two American continents excepting a portion of territory chiefly at the northern extremity of our own and confined to the remnants of dominion retained by Great Britain over the insular archipelago geographically the appendages of our part of the globe. With all the rest we have free trade even with the insular colonies of all the European nations except Great Britain. Her government also had manifested approaches to the adoption of a free and liberal intercourse between her colonies and other nations though by a sudden and scarcely explained revulsion the spirit of exclusion has been revived for operation upon the United States alone.The conclusion of our last treaty of peace with Great Britain was shortly afterwards followed by a commercial convention placing the direct intercourse between the two countries upon a footing of more equal reciprocity than had ever before been admitted. The same principle has since been much further extended by treaties with France Sweden Denmark the Hanseatic cities Prussia in Europe and with the Republics of Colombia and of Central America in this hemisphere. The mutual abolition of discriminating duties and charges upon the igation and commercial intercourse between the parties is the general maxim which characterizes them all. There is reason to expect that it will at no distant period be adopted by other nations both of Europe and America and to hope that by its universal prevalence one of the fruitful sources of wars of commercial competition will be extinguished.Among the nations upon whose governments many of our fellow citizens have had longpending claims of indemnity for depredations upon their property during a period when the rights of neutral commerce were disregarded was that of Denmark. They were soon after the events occurred the subject of a special mission from the United States at the close of which the assurance was given by His Danish Majesty that at a period of more tranquillity and of less distress they would be consered examined and deced upon in a spirit of determined purpose for the dispensation of justice. I have much pleasure in informing Congress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise is now in progress; that a small portion of the claims has already been settled to the satisfaction of the claimants and that we have reason to hope that the remainder will shortly be placed in a train of equitable adjustment. This result has always been confently expected from the character of personal integrity and of benevolence which the Sovereign of the Danish dominions has through every vicissitude of fortune maintained.The general aspect of the affairs of our neighboring American nations of the south has been rather of approaching than of settled tranquillity. Internal disturbances have been more frequent among them than their common friends would have desired. Our intercourse with all has continued to be that of friendship and of mutual good will. Treaties of commerce and of boundaries with the United Mexican States have been negotiated but from various successive obstacles not yet brought to a final conclusion.The civil war which unfortunately still prevails in the republics of Central America has been unpropitious to the cultivation of our commercial relations with them; and the dissensions and revolutionary changes in the republics of Colombia and of Peru have been seen with cordial regret by us who would gladly contribute to the happiness of both. It is with great satisfaction however that we have witnessed the recent conclusion of a peace between the governments of Buenos Aires and of Brazil and it is equally gratifying to observe that indemnity has been obtained for some of the injuries which our fellow citizens had sustained in the latter of those countries. The rest are in a train of negotiation which we hope may terminate to mutual satisfaction and that it may be succeeded by a treaty of commerce and igation upon liberal principles propitious to a great and growing commerce already important to the interests of our country.The condition and prospects of the revenue are more favorable than our most sanguine expectations had anticipated. The balance in the Treasury on 18280101 exclusive of the moneys received under the convention of 18261113 with Great Britain was $5861972.83. The receipts into the Treasury from 18280101 to 18280930 so far as they have been ascertained to form the basis of an estimate amount to $18633580.27 which with the receipts of the present quarter estimated at $5461283.40 form an aggregate of receipts during the year of $24094863.67. The expenditures of the year may probably amount to $25637111.63 and leave in the Treasury on 18290101 the sum of $5125638.14.The receipts of the present year have amounted to near $2000000 more than was anticipated at the commencement of the last session of Congress.The amount of duties secured on importations from the first of January to the 30th of September was about $22997000 and that of the estimated accruing revenue is $5000000 forming an aggregate for the year of near $28000000. This is $1000000 more than the estimate last December for the accruing revenue of the present year which with allowances for drawbacks and contingent deficiencies was expected to produce an actual revenue of $22300000. Had these only been realized the expenditures of the year would have been also proportionally reduced for of these $24000000 received upward of $9000000 have been applied to the extinction of public debt bearing an interest of 6 percent a year and of course reducing the burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount of more than $500000. The payments on account of interest during the current year exceed $3000000 presenting an aggregate of more than $12000000 applied during the year to the discharge of the public debt the whole of which remaining due on 18290101 will amount only to $58362135.78.That the revenue of the ensuing year will not fall short of that received in the one now expiring there are indications which can scarcely prove deceptive. In our country an uniform experience of 40 years has shown that what ever the tariff of duties upon articles imported from abroad has been the amount of importations has always borne an average value nearly approaching to that of the exports though occasionally differing in the balance some times being more and some times less. It is indeed a general law of prosperous commerce that the real value of exports should by a small and only a small balance exceed that of imports that balance being a permanent addition to the wealth of the nation.The extent of the prosperous commerce of the nation must be regulated by the amount of its exports and an important addition to the value of these will draw after it a corresponding increase of importations. It has happened in the vicissitudes of the seasons that the harvests of all Europe have in the late summer and autumn fallen short of their usual average. A relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of grain and flour from abroad has ensued a propitious market has been opened to the granaries of our country and a new prospect of reward presented to the labors of the husbandman which for several years has been denied. This accession to the profits of agriculture in the mdle and western portions of our union is accental and temporary. It may continue only for a single year. It may be as has been often experienced in the revolutions of time but the first of several scanty harvests in succession. We may conser it certain that for the approaching year it has added an item of large amount to the value of our exports and that it will produce a corresponding increase of importations. It may therefore confently be foreseen that the revenue of 1829 will equal and probably exceed that of 1828 and will afford the means of extinguishing $10000000 more of the principal of the public debt.This new element of prosperity to that part of our agricultural industry which is occupied in producing the first article of human subsistence is of the most cheering character to the feelings of patriotism. Proceeding from a cause which humanity will  with concern the sufferings of scarcity in distant lands it yields a consolatory reflection that this scarcity is in no respect attributable to us; that it comes from the dispensation of Him who ordains all in wisdom and goodness and who permits evil itself only as an instrument of good; that far from contributing to this scarcity our agency will be applied only to the alleviation of its severity and that in pouring forth from the abundance of our own garners the supplies which will partially restore plenty to those who are in need we shall ourselves reduce our stores and add to the price of our own bread so as in some degree to participate in the wants which it will be the good fortune of our country to relieve.The great interests of an agricultural commercial and manufacturing nation are so linked in union together that no permanent cause of prosperity to one of them can operate without extending its influence to the others. All these interests are alike under the protecting power of the legislative authority and the duties of the representative bodies are to conciliate them in harmony together.So far as the object of taxation is to raise a revenue for discharging the debts and defraying the expenses of the community its operation should be adapted as much as possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in proportion with their ability of bearing it without oppression. But the legislation of one nation is some times intentionally made to bear heavily upon the interests of another. That legislation adapted as it is meant to be to the special interests of its own people will often press most unequally upon the several component interests of its neighbors.Thus the legislation of Great Britain when as has recently been avowed adapted to the depression of a rival nation will naturally abound with regulations to interdict upon the productions of the soil or industry of the other which come in competition with its own and will present encouragement perhaps even bounty to the raw material of the other state which it can not produce itself and which is essential for the use of its manufactures competitors in the markets of the world with those of its commercial rival.Such is the state of commercial legislation of Great Britain as it bears upon our interests. It excludes with interdicting duties all importation (except in time of approaching famine) of the great staple of production of our Mdle and Western states; it proscribes with equal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock of the same portion and also of the Northern and Eastern part of our Union. It refuses even the rice of the South unless aggravated with a charge of duty upon the Northern carrier who brings it to them. But the cotton indispensable for their looms they will receive almost duty free to weave it into a fabric for our own wear to the destruction of our own manufactures which they are enabled thus to undersell.Is the selfprotecting energy of this nation so helpless that there exists in the political institutions of our country no power to counteract the bias of this foreign legislation; that the growers of grain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign markets of their produce; that the shippers must dismantle their ships the trade of the North stagnate at the wharves and the manufacturers starve at their looms while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to be clad in a foreign garb; that the Congress of the Union are impotent to restore the balance in favor of native industry destroyed by the statutes of another realm?More just and generous sentiments will I trust prevail. If the tariff adopted at the last session of Congress shall be found by experience to bear oppressively upon the interests of any one section of the union it ought to be and I can not doubt will be so modified as to alleviate its burden. To the voice of just complaint from any portion of their constituents the representatives of the states and of the people will never turn away their ears.But so long as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the domestic article; while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd and the husbandman shall be found thriving in their occupations under the duties imposed for the protection of domestic manufactures they will not repine at the prosperity shared with themselves by their fellow citizens of other professions nor denounce as violations of the Constitution the deliberate acts of Congress to shield from the wrongs of foreigns the native industry of the union.While the tariff of the last session of Congress was a subject of legislative deliberation it was foretold by some of its opposers that one of its necessary consequences would be to impair the revenue. It is yet too soon to pronounce with confence that this prediction was erroneous. The obstruction of one avenue of trade not unfrequently opens an issue to another. The consequence of the tariff will be to increase the exportation and to diminish the importation of some specific articles; but by the general law of trade the increase of exportation of one article will be followed by an increased importation of others the duties upon which will supply the deficiencies which the diminished importation would otherwise occasion. The effect of taxation upon revenue can seldom be foreseen with certainty. It must abe the test of experience.As yet no symptoms of diminution are perceptible in the receipts of the Treasury. As yet little addition of cost has even been experienced upon the articles burdened with heavier duties by the last tariff. The domestic manufacturer supplies the same or a kindred article at a diminished price and the consumer pays the same tribute to the labor of his own countryman which he must otherwise have pa to foreign industry and toil.The tariff of the last session was in its details not acceptable to the great interests of any portion of the union not even to the interest which it was specially intended to subserve. Its object was to balance the burdens upon native industry imposed by the operation of foreign laws but not to aggravate the burdens of one section of the union by the relief afforded to another. To the great principle sanctioned by that act—one of those upon which the Constitution itself was formed—I hope and trust the authorities of the union will adhere. But if any of the duties imposed by the act only relieve the manufacturer by aggravating the burden of the planter let a careful revisal of its provisions enlightened by the practical experience of its effects be directed to retain those which impart protection to native industry and remove or supply the place of those which only alleviate one great national interest by the depression of another.The United States of America and the people of every state of which they are composed are each of them sovereign powers. The legislative authority of the whole is exercised by Congress under authority granted them in the common Constitution. The legislative power of each state is exercised by assemblies deriving their authority from the constitution of the state. Each is sovereign within its own province. The distribution of power between them presupposes that these authorities will move in harmony with each other. The members of the state and general governments are all under oath to support both and allegiance is due to the one and to the other. The case of a conflict between these two powers has not been supposed nor has any provision been made for it in our institutions; as a virtuous nation of ancient times existed more than five centuries without a law for the punishment of parrice.More than once however in the progress of our history have the people and the legislatures of one or more states in moments of excitement been instigated to this conflict; and the means of effecting this impulse have been allegations that the acts of Congress to be resisted were unconstitutional. The people of no one state have ever delegated to their legislature the power of pronouncing an act of Congress unconstitutional but they have delegated to them powers by the exercise of which the execution of the laws of Congress within the state may be resisted. If we suppose the case of such conflicting legislation sustained by the corresponding executive and judicial authorities patriotism and philanthropy turn their eyes from the condition in which the parties would be placed and from that of the people of both which must be its victims.The reports from the Secretary of War and the various subordinate offices of the resort of that department present an exposition of the public administration of affairs connected with them through the course of the current year. The present state of the Army and the distribution of the force of which it is composed will be seen from the report of the Major General. Several alterations in the disposal of the troops have been found expedient in the course of the year and the discipline of the Army though not entirely free from exception has been generally good.The attention of Congress is particularly invited to that part of the report of the Secretary of War which concerns the existing system of our relations with the Indian tribes. At the establishment of the federal government under the present Constitution of the United States the principle was adopted of consering them as foreign and independent powers and also as proprietors of lands. They were moreover consered as savages whom it was our policy and our duty to use our influence in converting to Christianity and in bringing within the pale of civilization.As independent powers we negotiated with them by treaties; as proprietors we purchased of them all the lands which we could prevail upon them to sell; as brethren of the human race rude and ignorant we endeavored to bring them to the knowledge of religion and letters. The ultimate design was to incorporate in our own institutions that portion of them which could be converted to the state of civilization. In the practice of European states before our Revolution they had been consered as children to be governed; as tenants at discretion to be dispossessed as occasion might require; as hunters to be indemnified by trifling concessions for removal from the grounds from which their game was extirpated. In changing the system it would seem as if a full contemplation of the consequences of the change had not been taken.We have been far more successful in the acquisition of their lands than in imparting to them the principles or inspiring them with the spirit of civilization. But in appropriating to ourselves their hunting grounds we have brought upon ourselves the obligation of proving them with subsistence; and when we have had the rare good fortune of teaching them the arts of civilization and the doctrines of Christianity we have unexpectedly found them forming in the mst of ourselves communities claiming to be independent of ours and rivals of sovereignty within the territories of the members of our Union. This state of things requires that a remedy should be proved—a remedy which while it shall do justice to those unfortunate children of nature may secure to the members of our confederation their rights of sovereignty and of soil. As the outline of a project to that effect the s presented in the report of the Secretary of War are recommended to the conseration of Congress.The report from the Engineer Department presents a comprehensive  of the progress which has been made in the great systems promotive of the public interest commenced and organized under authority of Congress and the effects of which have already contributed to the security as they will hereafter largely contribute to the honor and dignity of the nation.The first of these great systems is that of fortifications commenced immediately after the close of our last war under the salutary experience which the events of that war had impressed upon our countrymen of its necessity. Introduced under the auspices of my immediate predecessor it has been continued with the persevering and liberal encouragement of the legislature and combined with corresponding exertions for the gradual increase and improvement of the Navy prepares for our extensive country a condition of defense adapted to any critical emergency which the varying course of events may bring forth. Our advances in these concerted systems have for the last 10 years been steady and progressive and in a few years more will be so completed as to leave no cause for apprehension that our sea coast will ever again offer a theater of hostile invasion.The next of these cardinal measures of policy is the preliminary to great and lasting works of public improvement in the surveys of roads examination for the course of canals and labors for the removal of the obstructions of rivers and harbors first commenced by the act of Congress of 18240430.The report exhibits in one table the funds appropriated at the last and preceding sessions of Congress for all these fortifications surveys and works of public improvement the manner in which these funds have been applied the amount expended upon the several works under construction and the further sums which may be necessary to complete them; in a second the works projected by the Board of Engineers which have not been commenced and the estimate of their cost; in a third the report of the annual Board of Visitors at the Military Academy at West Point.For 13 fortifications erecting on various points of our Atlantic coast from Rhode Island to Louisiana the aggregate expenditure of the year has fallen little short of $1000000. For the preparation of five additional reports of reconnoissances and surveys since the last session of Congress for the civil construction upon 37 different public works commenced eight others for which specific appropriations have been made by acts of Congress and 20 other incipient surveys under the authority given by the act of 18240430 about $1000000 more has been drawn from the Treasury.To these $2000000 is to be added the appropriation of $250000 to commence the erection of a breakwater near the mouth of the Delaware River the subscriptions to the Delaware and Chesapeake the Louisville and Portland the Dismal Swamp and the Chesapeake and Ohio canals the large donations of lands to the States of Ohio Indiana Illinois and Alabama for objects of improvements within those States and the sums appropriated for lighthouses buoys and piers on the coast; and a full  will be taken of the munificence of the nation in the application of its resources to the improvement of its own condition.Of these great national undertakings the Academy at West Point is among the most important in itself and the most comprehensive in its consequences. In that institution a part of the revenue of the nation is applied to defray the expense of educating a competent portion of her youth chiefly to the knowledge and the duties of military life. It is the living armory of the nation. While the other works of improvement enumerated in the reports now presented to the attention of Congress are destined to ameliorate the face of nature to multiply the facilities of communication between the different parts of the Union to assist the labors increase the comforts and enhance the enjoyments of inuals the instruction acquired at West Point enlarges the dominion and expands the capacities of the mind. Its beneficial results are already experienced in the composition of the Army and their influence is felt in the intellectual progress of society. The institution is susceptible still of great improvement from benefactions proposed by several successive Boards of Visitors to whose earnest and repeat
d recommendations I cheerfully add my own.With the usual annual reports from the Secretary of the Navy and the Board of Commissioners will be exhibited to the  of Congress the execution of the laws relating to that department of the public service. The repression of piracy in the West Indian and in the Grecian seas has been effectually maintained with scarcely any exception. During the war between the governments of Buenos Aires and of Brazil frequent collisions between the belligerent acts of power and the rights of neutral commerce occurred. Licentious ades irregularly enlisted or impressed sea men and the property of honest commerce seized with violence and even plundered under legal pretenses are disorders never separable from the conflicts of war upon the ocean.With a portion of them the correspondence of our commanders on the eastern aspect of the South American coast and among the islands of Greece discover how far we have been involved. In these the honor of our country and the rights of our citizens have been asserted and vindicated. The appearance of new squadrons in the Mediterranean and the ade of the Dardanelles indicate the danger of other obstacles to the freedom of commerce and the necessity of keeping our al force in those seas. To the suggestions repeated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy and tending to the permanent improvement of this institution I invite the favorable conseration of Congress.A resolution of the House of Representatives requesting that one of our small public vessels should be sent to the Pacific Ocean and South Sea to examine the coasts islands harbors shoals and reefs in those seas and to ascertain their true situation and description has been put in a train of execution. The vessel is nearly ready to depart. The successful accomplishment of the expedition may be greatly facilitated by suitable legislative provisions and particularly by an appropriation to defray its necessary expense. The addition of a second and perhaps a third vessel with a slight aggravation of the cost would contribute much to the safety of the citizens embarked on this undertaking the results of which may be of the deepest interest to our country.With the report of the Secretary of the Navy will be submitted in conformity to the act of Congress of 18270303 for the gradual improvement of the Navy of the United States statements of the expenditures under that act and of the measures for carrying the same into effect. Every section of that statute contains a distinct provision looking to the great object of the whole—the gradual improvement of the Navy. Under its salutary sanction stores of ship timber have been procured and are in process of seasoning and preservation for the future uses of the Navy. Arrangements have been made for the preservation of the live oak timber growing on the lands of the United States and for its reproduction to supply at future and distant days the waste of that most valuable material for ship building by the great consumption of it yearly for the commercial as well as for the military marine of our country.The construction of the two dry docks at Charlestown and at Norfolk is making satisfactory progress toward a durable establishment. The examinations and inquiries to ascertain the practicability and expediency of a marine railway at Pensacola though not yet accomplished have been postponed but to be more effectually made. The y yards of the United States have been examined and plans for their improvement and the preservation of the public property therein at Portsmouth Charlestown Philadelphia Washington and Gosport and to which two others are to be added have been prepared and received my sanction; and no other portion of my public duties has been performed with a more intimate conviction of its importance to the future welfare and security of the Union.With the report from the Postmaster General is exhibited a comparative  of the gradual increase of that establishment from five to five years since 1792 'til this time in the number of post offices which has grown from less than 200 to nearly 8000; in the revenue yielded by them which from $67000 has swollen to upward of $1500000 and in the number of miles of post roads which from 5642 have multiplied to 114536. While in the same period of time the population of the Union has about thrice doubled the rate of increase of these offices is nearly 40 and of the revenue and of traveled miles from 20 to 25 for one. The increase of revenue within the last five years has been nearly equal to the whole revenue of the Department in 1812.The expenditures of the Department during the year which ended on 18280701 have exceeded the receipts by a sum of about $25000. The excess has been occasioned by the increase of mail conveyances and facilities to the extent of near 800000 miles. It has been supplied by collections from the post masters of the arrearages of preceding years. While the correct principle seems to be that the income levied by the department should defray all its expenses it has never been the policy of this government to raise from this establishment any revenue to be applied to any other purposes. The suggestion of the Postmaster General that the insurance of the safe transmission of moneys by the mail might be assumed by the department for a moderate and competent remuneration will deserve the conseration of Congress.A report from the commissioner of the public buildings in this city exhibits the expenditures upon them in the course of the current year. It will be seen that the humane and benevolent intentions of Congress in proving by the act of 18260520 for the erection of a penitentiary in this District have been accomplished. The authority of further legislation is now required for the removal to this tenement of the offenders against the laws sentenced to atone by personal confinement for their crimes and to prove a code for their employment and government while thus confined.The commissioners appointed conformably to the act of 18270302 to prove for the adjustment of claims of persons entitled to indemnification under the first article of the Treaty of Ghent and for the distribution among such claimants of the sum pa by the government of Great Britain under the convention of 18261113 closed their labors on 18280830 last by awarding to the claimants the sum of $1197422.18 leaving a balance of $7537.82 which was distributed ratably amongst all the claimants to whom awards had been made according to the directions of the act.The exhibits appended to the report from the Commissioner of the General Land Office present the actual condition of that common property of the Union. The amount pa into the Treasury from the proceeds of lands during the year 1827 and for the first half of 1828 falls little short of $2000000. The propriety of further extending the time for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United States by the purchasers of the public lands limited by the act of 18280321 to 18290704 will claim the conseration of Congress to whose vigilance and careful attention the regulation disposal and preservation of this great national inheritance has by the people of the United States been intrusted.Among the important subjects to which the attention of the present Congress has already been invited and which may occupy their further and deliberate discussion will be the provision to be made for taking the fifth census of enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States. The Constitution of the United States requires that this enumeration should be made within every term of 10 years and the date from which the last enumeration commenced was the first Monday of August of the year 1820.The laws under which the former enumerations were taken were enacted at the session of Congress immediately preceding the operation; but conserable inconveniences were experienced from the delay of legislation to so late a period. That law like those of the preceding enumerations directed that the census should be taken by the marshals of the several districts and territories of the Union under instructions from the Secretary of State. The preparation and transmission to the marshals of those instructions required more time than was then allowed between the passage of the law and the day when the enumeration was to commence. The term of six months limited for the returns of the marshals was also found even then too short and must be more so now when an additional population of at least 3000000 must be presented upon the returns.As they are to be made at the short session of Congress it would as well as from other conserations be more convenient to commence the enumeration from an earlier period of the year than the first of August. The most favorable season would be the spring.On a re of the former enumerations it will be found that the plan for taking every census has contained many improvements upon that of its predecessor. The last is still susceptible of much improvement. The third Census was the first at which any account was taken of the manufactures of the country. It was repeated at the last enumeration but the returns in both cases were necessarily very imperfect. They must always be so resting of course only upon the communications voluntarily made by inuals interested in some of the manufacturing establishments. Yet they contained much valuable information and may by some supplementary provision of the law be rendered more effective.The columns of age commencing from infancy have hitherto been confined to a few periods all under the number of 45 years. Important knowledge would be obtained by extending these columns in intervals of 10 years to the utmost boundaries of human life. The labor of taking them would be a trifling addition to that already prescribed and the result would exhibit comparative tables of longevity highly interesting to the country. I deem it my duty further to observe that much of the imperfections in the returns of the last and perhaps of preceding enumerations proceeded from the inadequateness of the compensations allowed to the marshals and their assistants in taking them.In closing this communication it only remains for me to assure the Legislature of my continued earnest wish for the adoption of measures recommended by me heretofore and yet to be acted on by them and of the cordial concurrence on my part in every constitutional provision which may receive their sanction during the session tending to the general welfare. 
 GENTLEMAN  I have received the remonstrance you were pleased to address to me on the appointment of Samuel Bishop to the office of collector of New Haven lately vacated by the death of Dav Austin. The right of our fellow citizens to represent to the public aries their opinion on proceedings interesting to them is unquestionably a constitutional right often useful sometimes necessary and will always be respectfully acknoleged by me.  Of the various executive duties no one excites more anxious concern than that of placing the interests of our fellow citizens in the hands of honest men with understandings sufficient for their station. No duty at the same time is more difficult to fulfil. The knolege of characters possessed by a single inual is of necessity limited. To seek out the best through the whole Union we must resort to other information which from the best of men acting disinterestedly and with the purest motives is sometimes incorrect. In the case of Samuel Bishop however the subject of your remonstrance time was taken information was sought &amp; such obtained as could leave no room for doubt of his fitness. From private sources it was learnt that his understanding was sound his integrity pure his character unstained. And the offices confed to him within his own State are public evences of the estimation in which he is held by the State in general and the city &amp; township particularly in which he lives. is sa to be the town clerk a justice of the peace mayor of the city of New Haven an office held at the will of the legislature chief judge of the court of common pleas for New Haven county a court of high criminal and civil jurisdiction wherein most causes are deced without the right of appeal or re and sole judge of the court of probates wherein he singly deces all questions of wills settlement of estates testate and intestate appoints guardians settles their accounts and in fact has under his jurisdiction and care all the property real and personal of persons dying. The two last offices in the annual gift of the legislature were given to him in May last. Is it possible that the man to whom the legislature of Connecticut has so recently committed trusts of such difficulty &amp; magnitude is `unfit to be the collector of the district of New Haven' tho' acknoleged in the same writing to have obtained all this confence `by a long life of usefulness?' It is objected indeed in the remonstrance that he is 77. years of age; but at a much more advanced age our Franklin was the ornament of human nature. may not be able to perform in person all the details of his office; but if he gives us the benefit of his understanding his integrity his watchfulness and takes care that all the details are well performed by himself or his necessary assistants all public purposes will be answered. The remonstrance indeed does not allege that the office has been illy conducted but only apprehends that it will be so. Should this happen in event be assured I will do in it what shall be just and necessary for the public service. In the meantime he should be tried without being prejudged.  The removal as it is called of Mr. Goodrich forms another subject of complaint. Declarations by myself in favor of political tolerance exhortations to harmony and affection in social intercourse and to respect for the equal rights of the minority have on certain occasions been quoted &amp; misconstrued into assurances that the tenure of offices was to be undisturbed. But could candor apply such a construction? It is not indeed in the remonstrance that we find it; but it leads to the explanations which that calls for. When it is consered that during the late administration those who were not of a particular sect of politics were excluded from all office; when by a steady pursuit of this measure nearly the whole offices of the U S were monopolized by that sect; when the public sentiment at length declared itself and burst open the doors of honor and confence to those whose opinions they more approved was it to be imagined that this monopoly of office was still to be continued in the hands of the minority? Does it violate their equal rights to assert some rights in the majority also? Is it political intolerance to claim a proportionate share in the direction of the public affairs? Can they not harmonize in society unless they have everything in their own hands? If the will of the nation manifested by their various elections calls for an administration of government according with the opinions of those elected; if for the fulfilment of that will displacements are necessary with whom can they so justly begin as with persons appointed in the last moments of an administration not for its own a but to begin a career at the same time with their successors by whom they had never been approved and who could scarcely expect from them a cordial cooperation? Mr. Goodrich was one of these. Was it proper for him to place himself in office without knowing whether those whose agent he was to be would have confence in his agency? Can the preference of another as the successor to Mr. Austin be candly called a removal of Mr. Goodrich? If a due participation of office is a matter of right how are vacancies to be obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation none. Can any other mode than that of removal be proposed? This is a painful office; but it is made my duty and I meet it as such. I proceed in the operation with deliberation &amp; inquiry that it may injure the best men least and effect the purposes of justice &amp; public utility with the least private distress; that it may be thrown as much as possible on delinquency on oppression on intolerance on incompetence on anterevolutionary adherence to our enemies.  The remonstrance laments that a change in the administration must produce a change in the subordinate officers; in other words that it should be deemed necessary for all officers to think with their principal. But on whom does this imputation bear? On those who have excluded from office every shade of opinion which was not theirs? Or on those who have been so excluded? lament sincerely that unessential differences of political opinion should ever have been deemed sufficient to interdict half the society from the rights and the blessings of selfgovernment to proscribe them as characters unworthy of every trust. It would have been to me a circumstance of great relief had I found a moderate participation of office in the hands of the majority. I would gladly have left to time and accent to raise them to their just share. But their total exclusion calls for prompter correctives. shall correct the procedure; but that done disdain to follow it shall return with joy to that state of things when the only questions concerning a candate shall be is he honest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?  I tender you the homage of my high respect.
FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:I have the satisfaction on our present meeting of being able to communicate to you the successful termination of the war which had been commenced against the United States by the Regency of Algiers. The squadron in advance on that service under Commodore Decatur lost not a moment after its arrival in the Mediterranean in seeking the al force of the enemy then cruising in that sea and succeeded in capturing two of his ships one of them the principal ship commanded by the Algerine admiral. The high character of the American commander was brilliantly sustained on that occasion which brought his own ship into close action with that of his adversary as was the accustomed gallantry of all the officers and men actually engaged. Having prepared the way by this demonstration of American skill and prowess he hastened to the port of Algiers where peace was promptly yielded to his victorious force. In the terms stipulated the rights and honor of the United States were particularly consulted by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of the Dey of all pretensions to tribute from them. The impressions which have thus been made strengthened as they will have been by subsequent transactions with the Regencies of Tunis and of Tripoli by the appearance of the larger force which followed under Commodore Bainbrge the chief in command of the expedition and by the judicious precautionary arrangements left by him in that quarter afford a reasonable prospect of future security for the valuable portion of our commerce which passes within reach of the Barbary cruisers.It is another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with Great Britain has been succeeded by a convention on the subject of commerce concluded by the plenipotentiaries of the two countries. In this result a disposition is manifested on the part of that nation corresponding with the disposition of the United States which it may be hoped will be improved into liberal arrangements on other subjects on which the parties have mutual interests or which might endanger their future harmony. Congress will dece on the expediency of promoting such a sequel by giving effect to the measure of confining the American igation to American seamen ? a measure which at the same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency would have the further advantage of increasing the independence of our igation and the resources for our maritime defence.In conformity with the articles in the treaty of Ghent relating to the Indians as well as with a  to the tranquillity of our western and northwestern frontiers measures were taken to establish an immediate peace with the several tribes who had been engaged in hostilities against the United States. Such of them as were invited to Detroit acceded readily to a renewal of the former treaties of friendship. Of the other tribes who were invited to a station on the Mississippi the greater number have also accepted the peace offered to them. The resue consisting of the more distant tribes or parts of tribes remain to be brought over by further explanations or by such other means as may be adapted to the dispositions they may finally disclose.The Indian tribes within and bordering on the southern frontier whom a cruel war on their part had compelled us to chastise into peace have latterly shown a restlessness which has called for preparatory measures for repressing it and for protecting the commissioners engaged in carrying the terms of the peace into execution.The execution of the act fixing the military peace establishment has been attended with difficulties which even now can only be overcome by legislative a. The selection of officers the payment and discharge of the troops enlisted for the war the payment of the retained troops and their reunion from detached and distant stations the collection and security of the public property in the Quartermaster Commissary and Ordnance departments and the constant medical assistance required in hospitals and garrisons rendered a complete execution of the act impracticable on the ist of May the period more immediately cond. As soon however as circumstances would permit and as far as it has been practicable consistently with the public interests the reduction of the Army has been accomplished but the appropriations for its pay and for other branches of the military service having proved inadequate the earliest attention to that subject will be necessary and the expediency of continuing upon the peace establishment the staff officers who have hitherto been provisionally retained is also recommended to the conseration of Congress.In the performance of the Executive duty upon this occasion there has not been wanting a just sensibility to the merits of the American Army during the late war but the obvious policy and design in fixing an efficient military peace establishment d not afford an opportunity to distinguish the aged and infirm on account of their past services nor the wounded and disabled on account of their present sufferings The extent of the reduction indeed uoably involved the exclusion of many meritorious officers of every rank from the service of their country and so equal as well as so numerous were the claims to attention that a decision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attained Judged how ever in candor by a general standard of positive merit the Army register will it is believed do honor to the establish ment while the case of those officers whose names are not in eluded in it devolves with the strongest interest upon the legislative authority for such provision as shall be deemed the best calculated to give support and solace to the veteran and the inval to display the beneficence as well as the justice of the Government and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service upon every future emergency.Although the embarrassments arising from the want of an uniform national currency have not been diminished since the adjournment of Congress great satisfaction has been denved in contemplating the revival of the public credit and the effi ciency of the public resources The receipts into the Treasury from the vanous branches of revenue during the nine months ending on the 30th of September last have been estimated at $12500000 the issues of Treasury notes of every denomination during the same period amounted to the sum of $14000000 and there was also obtained upon loan during the same period a sum of $9000000 of which the sum of $6000000 was subscribed in cash and the sum of $3000000 in Treasury notes With these means added to the sum of $1500000 being the balance of money in the Treasury on the ist day of January there has been pa be tween the ist of January and the ist of October on account of the appropriations of the preceding and of the present year (exclusively of the amount of the Treasury notes subscribed to the loan and of the amount redeemed in the payment of du ties and taxes) the aggregate sum of $33500000 leaving a balance then in the Treasury estimated at the sum of $3000000 Independent however of the arrearages due for military services and supplies it is presumed that a further sum of $5000000 including the interest on the public debt payable on the ist of January next will be demanded at the Treasury to compete the expenditures of the present year and for which the existing ways and means will sufficiently prove.The national debt as it was ascertained on the ist of Octo ber last amounted in the whole to the sum of $120000000 consisting of the unredeemed balance of the debt contracted before the late war ($39000000) the amount of the funded debt contracted in consequence of the war ($64000000) and the amount of the unfunded and floating debt including the vanous issues of Treasury notes $17000000 which is in a gradual course of payment There will probably be some ad dition to the public debt upon the liquation of various claims which are depending and a conciliatory disposition on the part of Congress may lead honorably and advantageously to an equitable arrangement of the militia expenses incurred by the several States without the previous sanction or authority of the Government of the United States but when it is consered that the new as well as the old portion of the debt has been contracted in the assertion of the national rights and independence and when it is recollected that the public expenditures not being exclusively bestowed upon subjects of a transient nature will long be visible in the number and equip ments of the American Navy in the military works for the de fense of our harbors and our frontiers and in the supplies of our arsenals and magazines the amount will bear a gratifying comparison with the objects which have been attained as well as with the resources of the country.The arrangements of the finances with a  to the receipts and expenditures of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into the deliberations of Congress during the present session. It is true that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the means of maintaining the faith of the Government with its creditors inviolate and of prosecuting successfully the measures of the most liberal policy but will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burdens imposed by the necessities of the war. It is however essential to every modification of the finances that the benefits of an uniform national currency should be restored to the community. The absence of the precious metals will it is believed be a temporary evil but until they can again be rendered the general medium of exchange it devolves on the wisdom of Congress to prove a substitute which shall equally engage the confence and accommodate the wants of the citizens throughout the Union. If the operation of the State banks can not produce this result the probable operation of a national bank will merit conseration; and if neither of these expedients be deemed effectual it may become necessary to ascertain the terms upon which the notes of the Government (no longer required as an instrument of credit) shall be issued upon motives of general policy as a common medium of circulation.Notwithstanding the security for future repose which the United States ought to find in their love of peace and their constant respect for the rights of other nations the character of the times particularly inculcates the lesson that whether to prevent or repel danger we ought not to be unprepared for it. This conseration will sufficiently recommend to Congress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual completion of the works of defense both fixed and floating on our maritime frontier and an adequate provision for guarding our inland frontier against dangers to which certain portions of it may continue to be exposed.As an improvement in our military establishment it will deserve the conseration of Congress whether a corps of invals might not be so organized and employed as at once to a in the support of meritorious inuals excluded by age or infirmities from the existing establishment and to procure to the public the benefit of their stationary services and of their exemplary discipline. I recommend also an enlargement of the Military Academy already established and the establishment of others in other sections of the Union; and I can not press too much on the attention of Congress such a ification and organization of the militia as will most effectually render it the safeguard of a free state. If experience has shewn in the recent splend achievements of militia the value of this resource for the public defense it has shewn also the importance of that skill in the use of arms and that familiarity with the essential rules of discipline which can not be expected from the regulations now in force. With this subject is intimately connected the necessity of accommodating the laws in every respect to the great object of enabling the political authority of the Union to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of the Union in the cases designated by the Constitution.The signal services which have been rendered by our Navy and the capacities it has developed for successful cooperation in the national defense will give to that portion of the public force its full value in the eyes of Congress at an epoch which calls for the constant vigilance of all governments. To preserve the ships now in a sound state to complete those already cond to prove amply the imperishable materials for prompt augmentations and to improve the existing arrangements into more advantageous establishments for the construction the repairs and the security of vessels of war is dictated by the soundest policy.In adjusting the duties on imports to the object of revenue the influence of the tariff on manufactures will necessarily present itself for conseration. However wise the theory may be which leaves to the sagacity and interest of inuals the application of their industry and resources there are in this as in other cases exceptions to the general rule. Beses the condition which the theory itself implies of a reciprocal adoption by other nations experience teaches that so many circumstances must concur in introducing and maturing manufacturing establishments especially of the more complicated kinds that a country may remain long without them although sufficiently advanced and in some respects even peculiarly fitted for carrying them on with success. Under circumstances giving a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry it has made among us a progress and exhibited an efficiency which justify the belief that with a protection not more than is due to the enterprising citizens whose interests are now at stake it will become at an early day not only safe against occasional competitions from abroad but a source of domestic wealth and even of external commerce. In selecting the branches more especially entitled to the public patronage a preference is obviously claimed by such as will relieve the United States from a dependence on foreign supplies ever subject to casual failures for articles necessary for the public defense or connected with the primary wants of inuals. It will be an additional recommendation of particular manufactures where the materials for them are extensively drawn from our agriculture and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of national prosperity and independence an encouragement which can not fail to be rewarded.Among the means of advancing the public interest the occasion is a proper one for recalling the attention of Congress to the great importance of establishing throughout our country the roads and canals which can best be executed under the national authority. No objects within the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense bestowed on them; there are none the utility of which is more universally ascertained and acknowledged; none that do more honor to the governments whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciates them. Nor is there any country which presents a field where nature invites more the art of man to complete her own work for his accommodation and benefit. These conserations are strengthened moreover by the political effect of these facilities for intercommunication in bringing and binding more closely together the various parts of our extended confederacy. Whilst the States inually with a laudable enterprise and emulation avail themselves of their local advantages by new roads by igable canals and by improving the streams susceptible of igation the General Government is the more urged to similar undertakings requiring a national jurisdiction and national means by the prospect of thus systematically completing so inestimable a work; and it is a happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority which may be encountered can be supplied in a mode which the Constitution itself has provently pointed out.The present is a favorable season also for bringing again into  the establishment of a national seminary of learning within the District of Columbia and with means drawn from the property therein subject to the authority of the General Government. Such an institution claims the patronage of Congress as a monument of their solicitude for the advancement of knowledge without which the blessings of liberty can not be fully enjoyed or long preserved; as a model instructive in the formation of other seminaries; as a nursery of enlightened preceptors and as a central resort of youth and genius from every part of their country diffusing on their return examples of those national feelings those liberal sentiments and those congenial manners which contribute cement to our Union and strength to the great political fabric of which that is the foundation.In closing this communication I ought not to repress a sensibility in which you will unite to the happy lot of our country and to the goodness of a superintending Provence to which we are indebted for it. Whilst other portions of mankind are laboring under the distresses of war or struggling with adversity in other forms the United States are in the tranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace. In reing the scenes through which it has been attained we can rejoice in the proofs given that our political institutions founded in human rights and framed for their preservation are equal to the severest trials of war as well as adapted to the ordinary periods of repose. As fruits of this experience and of the reputation acquired by the American arms on the land and on the water the nation finds itself possessed of a growing respect abroad and of a just confence in itself which are among the best pledges for its peaceful career. Under other aspects of our country the strongest features of its flourishing condition are seen in a population raply increasing on a territory as productive as it is extensive; in a general industry and fertile ingenuity which find their ample rewards and in an affluent revenue which admits a reduction of the public burdens without withdrawing the means of sustaining the public credit of gradually discharging the public debt of proving for the necessary defensive and precautionary establishments and of patronizing in every authorized mode undertakings conducive to the aggregate wealth and inual comfort of our citizens.It remains for the guardians of the public welfare to persevere in that justice and good will toward other nations which invite a return of these sentiments toward the United States; to cherish institutions which guarantee their safety and their liberties civil and religious; and to combine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the national advantages and a protection and extension of the independent resources of our highly favored and happy country.In all measures having such objects my faithful cooperation will be afforded.
FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: On this first occasion of meeting you it affords me much satisfaction to be able to communicate the commencement of a favorable change in our foreign relations the critical state of which induced a session of Congress at this early period.In consequence of the provisions of the act interdicting commercial intercourse with Great Britain and France our ministers at London and Paris were without delay instructed to let it be understood by the French and British Governments that the authority vested in the Executive to renew commercial intercourse with their respective nations would be exercised in the case specified by that act.Soon after these instructions were dispatched it was found that the British Government anticipating from early proceedings of Congress at their last session the state of our laws which has had the effect of placing the two belligerent powers on a footing of equal restrictions and relying on the conciliatory disposition of the United States had transmitted to their legation here provisional instructions not only to offer satisfaction for the attack on the frigate Chesapeake and to make known the determination of His Britannic Majesty to send an envoy extraordinary with powers to conclude a treaty on all the points between the two countries but moreover to signify his willingness in the meantime to withdraw his orders in council in the persuasion that the intercourse with Great Britain would be renewed on the part of the United States.These steps of the British Government led to the correspondence and the proclamation now la before you by virtue of which the commerce between the two countries will be renewable after the 10th day of June next.Whilst I take pleasure in doing justice to the councils of His Britannic Majesty which no longer adhering to the policy which made an abandonment by France of her decrees a prerequisite to a revocation of the British orders have substituted the amicable course which has issued thus happily I can not do less than refer to the proposal heretofore made on the part of the United States embracing a like restoration of the suspended commerce as a proof of the spirit of accommodation which at no time been intermitted and to the result which now calls for our congratulations as corroborating the principles by which the public councils have been gued during a period of the most trying embarrassments.The discontinuance of the British orders as they respect the United States having been thus arranged a communication of the event has been forwarded in one of our public vessels to our minister plenipotentiary at Paris with instructions to avail himself of the important addition thereby made to the conserations which press on the justice of the French Government a revocation of its decrees or such a modification of them as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States.The revision of our commercial laws proper to adapt them to the arrangement which has taken place with Great Britain will doubtless engage the early attention of Congress. It will be worthy at the same time of their lust and provent care to make such further alterations in the laws as will more especially protect and foster the several branches of manufacture which have been recently instituted or extended by the laudable exertions of our citizens.Under the existing aspect of our affairs I have thought it not inconsistent with a just precaution to have the gunboats with the exception of those at New Orleans placed in a situation incurring no expense beyond that requisite for their preservation and conveniency for future service and to have the crews of those at New Orleans reduced to the number required for their igation and safety.I have thought also that our citizens detached in quotas of militia amounting to 100000 under the act of March 1808 might not improperly be relieved from the state in which they were held for immediate service. A discharge of them has been accordingly directed.The progress made in raising and organizing the additional military force for which provision was made by the act of April 1808 together with the disposition of the troops will appear by a report which the Secretary of War is preparing and which will be la before you.Of the additional frigates required by an act of the last session to be fitted for actual service two are in readiness one nearly so and the fourth is expected to be ready in the month of July. A report which the Secretary of the Navy is preparing on the subject to be la before Congress will shew at the same time the progress made in officering and manning these ships. It will shew also the degree in which the provisions of the act relating to the other public armed ships have been carried into execution.It will rest with the judgment of Congress to dece how far the change in our external prospects may authorize any modifications of the laws relating to the army and y establishments.The works of defense for our seaport towns and harbors have proceeded with as much activity as the season of the year and other circumstances would admit. It is necessary however to state that the appropriations hitherto made being found to be deficient a further provision will claim the early conseration of Congress.The whole of the 8 per cent stock remaining due by the United States amounting to $5300000 had been reimbursed on the last day of the year 1808; and on the 1st day of April last the sum in the Treasury exceeded $9500000. This together with the receipts of the current year on account of former revenue bonds will probably be nearly if not altogether sufficient to defray the expenses of the year. But the suspension of exports and the consequent decrease of importations during the last twelve months will necessarily cause a great diminution in the receipts of the year 1810. After that year should our foreign relations be undisturbed the revenue will again be more than commensurate to all the expenditures.Aware of the inconveniences of a protracted session at the present season of the year I forbear to call the attention of the Legislature to any matters not particularly urgent. It remains therefore only to assure you of the felity and alacrity with which I shall cooperate for the welfare and happiness of our country and to pray that it may experience a continuance of the ine blessings by which it has been so signally favored.JAMES MADISON.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:In reing the present state of our country our attention cannot be withheld from the effect produced by peculiar seasons which have very generally impaired the annual gifts of the earth and threatened scarcity in particular districts. Such however is the variety of soils of climates and of products within our extensive limits that the aggregate resources for subsistence are more than sufficient for the aggregate wants. And as far as an economy of consumption more than usual may be necessary our thankfulness is due to Provence for what is far more than a compensation in the remarkable health which has distinguished the present year. Amst the advantages which have succeeded the peace of Europe and that of the United States with Great Britain in a general invigoration of industry among us and in the extension of our commerce the value of which is more and more disclosing itself to commercial nations it is to be regretted that a depression is experienced by particular branches of our manufactures and by a portion of our igation. As the first proceeds in an essential degree from an excess of imported merchandise which carries a check in its own tendency the cause in its present extent can not be very long in duration. The evil will not however be ed by Congress without a recollection that manufacturing establishments if suffered to sink too low or languish too long may not revive after the causes shall have ceased and that in the vicissitudes of human affairs situations may recur in which a dependence on foreign sources for indispensable supplies may be among the most serious embarrassments. The depressed state of our igation is to be ascribed in a material degree to its exclusion from the colonial ports of the nation most extensively connected with us in commerce and from the indirect operation of that exclusion. Previous to the late convention at London between the United States and Great Britain the relative state of the igation laws of the two countries growing out of the treaty of 1794 had given to the British igation a material advantage over the American in the intercourse between the American ports and British ports in Europe. The convention of London equalized the laws of the two countries relating to those ports leaving the intercourse between our ports and the ports of the British colonies subject as before to the respective regulations of the parties. The British Government enforcing now regulations which prohibit a trade between its colonies and the United States in American vessels whilst they permit a trade in British vessels the American igation loses accordingly and the loss is augmented by the advantage which is given to the British competition over the American in the igation between our ports and British ports in Europe by the circuitous voyages enjoyed by the one and not enjoyed by the other. The reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity applied to one branch of the commercial intercourse has been pressed on our part as equally applicable to both branches; but it is ascertained that the British cabinet declines all negotiation on the subject with a disavowal however of any disposition to  in an unfriendly light whatever countervailing regulations the United States may oppose to the regulations of which they complain. The wisdom of the Legislature will dece on the course which under these circumstances is prescribed by a joint regard to the amicable relations between the two nations and to the just interests of the United States. I have the satisfaction to state generally that we remain in amity with foreign powers. An occurrence has indeed taken place in the Gulf of Mexico which if sanctioned by the Spanish Government may make an exception as to that power. According to the report of our al commander on that station one of our public armed vessels was attacked by an overpowering force under a Spanish commander and the American flag with the officers and crew insulted in a manner calling for prompt reparation. This has been demanded. In the mean time a frigate and a smaller vessel of war have been ordered into that Gulf for the protection of our commerce. It would be improper to omit that the representative of His Catholic Majesty in the United States lost no time in giving the strongest assurances that no hostile order could have emanated from his Government and that it will be as ready to do as to expect whatever the nature of the case and the friendly relations of the two countries shall be found to require. The posture of our affairs with Algiers at the present moment is not known. The Day drawing pretexts from circumstances for which the United States were not answerable addressed a letter to this Government declaring the treaty last concluded with him to have been annulled by our violation of it and presenting as the alternative war or a renewal of the former treaty which stipulated among other things an annual tribute. The answer with an explicit declaration that the United States preferred war to tribute required his recognition and observance of the treaty last made which abolishes tribute and the slavery of our captured citizens. The result of the answer has not been received. Should he renew his warfare on our commerce we rely on the protection it will find in our al force actually in the Mediterranean. With the other Barbary States our affairs have undergone no change. The Indian tribes within our limits appear also disposed to remain at peace. From several of them purchases of lands have been made particularly favorable to the wishes and security of our frontier settlements as well as to the general interests of the nation. In some instances the titles though not supported by due proof and clashing those of one tribe with the claims of another have been extinguished by double purchases the benevolent policy of the United States preferring the augmented expense to the hazard of doing injustice or to the enforcement of justice against a feeble and untutored people by means involving or threatening an effusion of blood. I am happy to ad that the tranquillity which has been restored among the tribes themselves as well as between them and our own population will favor the resumption of the work of civilization which had made an encouraging progress among some tribes and that the facility is increasing for extending that ed and inual ownership which exists now in movable property only to the soil itself and of thus establishing in the culture and improvement of it the true foundation for a transit from the habits of the savage to the arts and comforts of social life. As a subject of the highest importance to the national welfare I must again earnestly recommend to the conseration of Congress a reorganization of the militia on a plan which will form it into es according to the periods of life more or less adapted to military services. An efficient militia is authorized and cond by the Constitution and required by the spirit and safety of free government. The present organization of our militia is universally regarded as less efficient than it ought to be made and no organization can be better calculated to give to it its due force than a ification which will assign the foremost place in the defense of the country to that portion of its citizens whose activity and animation best enable them to rally to its standard. Beses the conseration that a time of peace is the time when the change can be made with most convenience and equity it will now be aed by the experience of a recent war in which the militia bore so interesting a part. Congress will call to mind that no adequate provision has yet been made for the uniformity of weights and measures also cond by the Constitution. The great utility of a standard fixed in its nature and founded on the easy rule of decimal proportions is sufficiently obvious. It led the Government at an early stage to preparatory steps for introducing it and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public gratitude. The importance which I have attached to the establishment of a university within this District on a scale and for objects worthy of the American nation induces me to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable conseration of Congress. And I particularly invite again their attention to the expediency of exercising their existing powers and where necessary of resorting to the prescribed mode of enlarging them in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of roads and canals such as will have the effect of drawing more closely together every part of our country by promoting intercourse and improvements and by increasing the share of every part in the common stock of national prosperity. Occurrences having taken place which shew that the statutory provisions for the dispensation of criminal justice are deficient in relation both to places and to persons under the exclusive cognizance of the national authority an amendment of the law embracing such cases will merit the earliest attention of the Legislature. It will be a seasonable occasion also for inquiring how far legislative interposition may be further requisite in proving penalties for offenses designated in the Constitution or in the statutes and to which either no penalties are annexed or none with sufficient certainty. And I submit to the wisdom of Congress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not expedient for the purpose of mitigating in certain cases penalties which were adopted into it antecedent to experiment and examples which justify and recommend a more lenient policy. The United States having been the first to abolish within the extent of their authority the transportation of the natives of Africa into slavery by prohibiting the introduction of slaves and by punishing their citizens participating in the traffic can not but be gratified at the progress made by concurrent efforts of other nations toward a general suppression of so great an evil. They must feel at the same time the greater solicitude to give the fullest efficacy to their own regulations. With that  the interposition of Congress appears to be required by the violations and evasions which it is suggested are chargeable on unworthy citizens who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flags and with foreign ports and by collusive importations of slaves into the United States through adjoining ports and territories. I present the subject to Congress with a full assurance of their disposition to apply all the remedy which can be afforded by an amendment of the law. The regulations which were intended to guard against abuses of a kindred character in the trade between the several States ought also to be rendered more effectual for their humane object. To these recommendations I add for the conseration of Congress the expediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment and of an additional department in the executive branch of the Government. The first is called for by the accruing business which necessarily swells the duties of the Federal courts and by the great and wening space within which justice is to be dispensed by them. The time seems to have arrived which claims for members of the Supreme Court a relief from itinerary fatigues incompatible as well with the age which a portion of them will always have attained as with the researches and preparations which are due to their stations and to the jurical reputation of their country. And conserations equally cogent require a more convenient organization of the subordinate tribunals which may be accomplished without an objectionable increase of the number or expense of the judges. The extent and variety of executive business also accumulating with the progress of our country and its growing population call for an additional department to be charged with duties now over burdening other departments and with such as have not been annexed to any department. The course of experience recommends as another improvement in the executive establishment that the provision for the station of AttorneyGeneral whose resence at the seat of Government official connections with it and the management of the public business before the judiciary preclude an extensive participation in professional emoluments be made more adequate to his services and his relinquishments and that with a  to his reasonable accommodation and to a proper depository of his official opinions and proceedings there be included in the provision the usual appurtenances to a public office. In directing the legislative attention to the state of the finances it is a subject of great gratification to find that even within the short period which has elapsed since the return of peace the revenue has far exceeded all the current demands upon the Treasury and that under any probable diminution of its future annual products which the vicissitudes of commerce may occasion it will afford an ample fund for the effectual and early extinguishment of the public debt. It has been estimated that during the year 1816 the actual receipts of revenue at the Treasury including the balance at the commencement of the year and excluding the proceeds of loans and Treasury notes will amount to about the sum of $47000000; that during the same year the actual payments at the Treasury including the payment of the arrearages of the War Department as well as the payment of a conserable excess beyond the annual appropriations will amount to about the sum of $38M and that consequently at the close of the year there will be a surplus in the Treasury of about the sum of $9M. The operations of the Treasury continued to be obstructed by difficulties arising from the condition of the national currency but they have nevertheless been effectual to a beneficial extent in the reduction of the public debt and the establishment of the public credit. The floating debt of Treasury notes and temporary loans will soon be entirely discharged. The aggregate of the funded debt composed of debts incurred during the wars of 1776 and 1812 has been estimated with reference to the first of January next at a sum not exceeding $110M. The ordinary annual expenses of the Government for the maintenance of all its institutions civil military and al have been estimated at a sum of $20M and the permanent revenue to be derived from all the existing sources has been estimated at a sum of $25M. Upon this general  of the subject it is obvious that there is only wanting to the fiscal prosperity of the Government the restoration of an uniform medium of exchange. The resources and the faith of the nation displayed in the system which Congress has established insure respect and confence both at home and abroad. The local accumulations of the revenue have already enabled the Treasury to meet the public engagements in the local currency of most of the States and it is expected that the same cause will produce the same effect throughout the Union; but for the interests of the community at large as well as for the purposes of the Treasury it is essential that the nation should possess a currency of equal value credit and use wherever it may circulate. The Constitution has intrusted Congress exclusively with the power of creating and regulating a currency of that description and the measures which were taken during the last session in execution of the power give every promise of success. The Bank of the United States has been organized under auspices the most favorable and can not fail to be an important auxiliary to those measures. For a more enlarged  of the public finances with a  of the measures pursued by the Treasury Department previous to the resignation of the late Secretary I transmit an extract from the last report of that officer. Congress will perceive in it ample proofs of the sol foundation on which the financial prosperity of the nation rests and will do justice to the distinguished ability and successful exertions with which the duties of the Department were executed during a period remarkable for its difficulties and its peculiar perplexities. The period of my retiring from the public service being at little distance I shall find no occasion more proper than the present for expressing to my fellow citizens my deep sense of the continued confence and kind support which I have received from them. My grateful recollection of these distinguished marks of their favorable regard can never cease and with the consciousness that if I have not served my country with greater ability I have served it with a sincere devotion will accompany me as a source of unfailing gratification. Happily I shall carry with me from the public theater other sources which those who love their country most will best appreciate. I shall behold it blessed with tranquillity and prosperity at home and with peace and respect abroad. I can indulge the proud reflection that the American people have reached in safety and success their 40th year as an independent nation; that for nearly an entire generation they have had experience of their present Constitution the offspring of their undisturbed deliberations and of their free choice; that they have found it to bear the trials of adverse as well as prosperous circumstances; to contain in its combination of the federate and elective principles a reconcilement of public strength with inual liberty of national power for the defense of national rights with a security against wars of injustice of ambition and vainglory in the fundamental provision which subjects all questions of war to the will of the nation itself which is to pay its costs and feel its calamities. Nor is it less a peculiar felicity of this Constitution so dear to us all that it is found to be capable without losing its vital energies of expanding itself over a spacious territory with the increase and expansion of the community for whose benefit it was established. And may I not be allowed to add to this gratifying spectacle that I shall read in the character of the American people in their devotion to true liberty and to the Constitution which is its palladium sure presages that the destined career of my country will exhibit a Government pursuing the public good as its sole object and regulating its means by the great principles consecrated in its charger and by those moral principles to which they are so well allied; a Government which watches over the purity of elections the freedom of speech and of the press the trial by jury and the equal interdict against encroachments and compacts between religion and the state; which maintains inviolably the maxims of public faith the security of persons and property and encourages in every authorized mode the general diffusion of knowledge which guarantees to public liberty its permanency and to those who possess the blessing the true enjoyment of it; a Government which avos intrusions on the internal repose of other nations and repels them from its own; which does justice to all nations with a readiness equal to the firmness with which it requires justice from them; and which whilst it refines its domestic code from every ingredient not congenial with the precepts of an enlightened age and the sentiments of a virtuous people seeks by appeals to reason and by its liberal examples to infuse into the law which governs the civilized world a spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamities of war and meliorate the social and beneficent relations of peace; a Government in a word whose conduct within and without may bespeak the most noble of ambitions  that of promoting peace on earth and good will to man. These contemplations sweetening the remnant of my days will animate my prayers for the happiness of my beloved country and a perpetuity of the institutions under which it is enjoyed. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: To a people fellowcitizens who sincerely desire the happiness and prosperity of other nations: to those who justly calculate that their own wellbeing is advanced by that of the nations with which they have intercourse it will be a satisfaction to observe that the war which was lighted up Europe a little before our last meeting has not yet extended its flames to other nations nor been marked by the calamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war. The irregularities too on the ocean which generally harass the commerce of neutral nations have in distant parts disturbed ours less than on former occasions; but in the American seas they have been greater from peculiar causes and even within our harbors and jurisdiction infringements on the authority of the laws have been committed which have called for serious attention The friendly conduct of the Governments from whose officers and subjects these acts have proceeded in other respects and in places more under their observation and control gives us confence that our representations on this subject will have been completely regarded.While noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by others those on our own part should not be omitted nor left unproved for. Complaints have been received that persons resing within the United States have taken on themselves to arm merchant vessels and to force a commerce into certain ports and countries in defiance of the laws of those countries in defiance of the laws of those countries. That inuals should undertake to wage private war independently of the authority of their country can not be permitted in a wellordered society. Its tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations and to endanger the peace of our own is so oblivious that I doubt not you will adopt measures for restraining it effectually in future.Soon after the passage of the act of the last session authorizing the establishment of a district and a port of entry on the waters of the Mobile we learnt that its object was misunderstood on the part of Spain. Cand explanations were immediately given and assurances that reserving our claims in that quarter as a subject of discussion and arrangement with Spain no act was mediated in the meantime inconsistent with peace and friendship existing between the two nations and that conformably to these intentions would be the execution of the law. That Government had however thought proper to suspend the ratification of the convention of 1802; but the explanations which would reach them soon after and still more the confirmation of them by the tenor of the instrument establishing the port and district may reasonably be expected to replace them in the dispositions and s of the whole subject which originally dictated the convention.I have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been urged by that Government against the vality of our title to the country of Louisana have been withdrawn its exact limits however remaining still to be settled between us; and to this is to be added that having prepared and delivered the stock created in execution of the convention of Paris of April 30 1803. In conseration of the cession of that country we have received from the Government of France an acknowledgment in due form of the fulfillment of that stipulation.With the nations of Europe in general our friendship and intercourse are undisturbed and from the Governments of the belligerent powers especially we continue to receive those friendly manifestations which are justly due to an honest neutrality and to such good offices consistent with that as we have opportunities of rendering.The activity and success of the small force employed in the Mediterranean in the early part of the present year the reenforcements sent into that sea and the energy of the officers having command in the several vessels will I trust by the sufferings of war reduce the barbarians of Tripoli to the desire of peace on proper terms. Great injury however ensues to ourselves as well as to others interested from the distance to which prizes must be brought for adjudication and from the impracticability of bringing hither such as are not seaworthy.The Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by our treaty their rejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent. But to those who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands will not cost us less than a war we must leave as a question of calculation for them also whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them less than a war. We can do to each other very sensible injuries by war but mutual advantages of peace make that the best interest of both.Peace and intercourse with other powers on the same coast continue on the footing on which they are established by treaty.In pursuance of the act proving for the temporary government of Louisana the necessary officers for the Territory of Orleans were appointed in due time to commence the exercise of their s on the 1st. day of October. The distance however of some of them and indispensable previous arrangements may have retarded its commencement in some of its parts. The form of government thus proved having been consered but as temporary and open to such future improvements as further information of the circumstances of our brethren there might suggest it will of course be subject to your conseration.In the District of Louisana it has been thought best to adopt the ision into subordinate districts which had been established under its former government. These being five in number a commanding officer has been appointed to each according to the provisions of the law and so soon as they can be at their stations that district will also be in its due state of organization. In the meantime their places are supplied by the officers commanding there. And the s of the governor and judges of Indiana having commenced the government we presume is preceding in its new form. The lead mines in that district offer so rich a supply of that metal as to merit attention. The report now communicated will inform you of their state and of the necessity of immediate inquiry into their occupation and titles.With the Indian tribes established within our newly acquired limits I have deemed it necessary to open conferences for the purpose of establishing a good understanding and neighborly relations between us. So far as we have yet learned we have reason to believe that their dispositions on their part we have in our own hands means which can not fail us for preserving their peace and friendship. By pursuing an uniform course of justice toward them by aing them in all the improvements which may better their condition and especially by establishing a commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them and only not losing to us and so regulated as that no incendiaries of our own or any other nation may be permitted to disturb the natural effects of our just and friendly offices we may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort and prosperity that the protection of our citizens from their disorderly members will become their interest and their voluntary care. Instead therefore of an augmentation of military force proportioned to our extension of frontier I propose a moderate enlargement of the capital employed in that commerce as a more effectual economical and humane instrument for preserving peace and good neighborhood with them.On this se of the Mississippi an important relinquishment of native title has been received from the Delawares. That tribe desiring to extinguish in their people the spirit of hunting and to convert superfluous lands into the means of improving what they retain has ceded to us all the country between Wabash and Ohio south of and including the road from the raps toward Vincennes for which they are to receive annuities in animals and implements for agriculture and in other necessaries. This acquisition is important not only for its extent and fertility but as fronting 300 miles on the Ohio and near half that on the Wabash. The produce of the settled country descending those rivers will no longer pass in re of the Indian frontier but in a small portion and with the cession heretofore made by the Kaskaskias nearly consolates our possessions north of the Ohio in a very respectful breadthfrom Lake Erie to the Mississippi. The Piankeshaws having some claim to the country ceded by the Delawares it has been thought best to keep quiet that by fair purchase also. So soon as the treaties on this subject shall have received their constitutional sanctions they shall be la before both Houses.The act of Congress of February 28 1803 for building and employing a number of gunboats is now in a course of execution to the extent there proved for. The obstacle to al enterprise which vessels of this construction offer for our seaport towns their utility toward supporting within our waters the authority of the laws the promptness with which they will be manned by the seamen and militia of the place in the moment they are wanting the facility of their assembling from different parts of the coast to any point where they are required in greater force than ordinary the economy of their maintenance and preservation from decay when not in actual service and the competence of our finances to this defensive provision without any new burthen are conserations which will have due weight with Congress in decing on the expediency of adding to their number from year to year as experience shall test their utility until all our important harbors by these and auxiliary means shall be secured against insult and opposition to the laws.No circumstances has arisen since your last session which calls for any augmentation of our regular military force. Should any improvement occur in militia system that will be always seasonable.Accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year with estimates for the ensuing one will as usual be la before you.The state of our finances continues to fulfill our expectations. Eleven millions and a half of dollars received in the course of the year ending the 30th of September last have enabled us us after meeting all the ordinary expenses of the year to pay upward of $3600000 of the public debt exclusive of interest. This payment with those of the two preceding years has extinguished upward of twelve millions of the principle and a greater sum of interest within that period and by a proportionate diminution of interest renders already sensible the effect of the growing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principle.It is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last year exceeds that of the preceding and the probable receipts of the ensuing year may safely be relied on as sufficient with the sum already in the Treasury to meet all the current demands of the year to discharge upwards of three millions and a half of the engagements incurred under the British and French conventions  and to advance in the further redemption of the funded debt as raply as had been cond. These fellowcitizens are the principle matters which I have thought it necessary at this time to communicate for your conseration and attention. Some others will be la before you in the course of the session; but in the discharge of the great duties confed to you by our country you will take a broader  of the field of legislation. Whether the great interests of agriculture manufactures commerce or igation can within the pale of your constitutional powers be aed in any of their relations; whether laws are proved in all cases where they are wanting; whether those proved are exactly what they should be; whether any abuses take place in their administration or in that of the public revenues; whether the organization of the public agents or of the public force is perfect in all its parts; in fine whether anything can be done to advance the general good are questions within the limits of your s which will necessarily occupy your attention. In these and all other matters which you in your wisdom may propose for the good of our country you may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation and faithful execution.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Many important subjects will claim your attention during the present session of which I shall endeavor to give in a of your deliberations a just ea in this communication. I undertake this duty with diffence from the vast extent of the interests on which I have to treat and of their great importance to every portion of our Union. I enter on it with zeal from a thorough conviction that there never was a period since the establishment of our Revolution when regarding the condition of the civilized world and its bearing on us there was greater necessity for devotion in the public servants to their respective duties or for virtue patriotism and union in our constituents. Meeting in you a new Congress I deem it proper to present this  of public affairs in greater detail than might otherwise be necessary. I do it however with peculiar satisfaction from a knowledge that in this respect I shall comply more fully with the sound principles of our Government. The people being with us exclusively the sovereign it is indispensable that full information be la before them on all important subjects to enable them to exercise that high power with complete effect. If kept in the dark they must be incompetent to it. We are all liable to error and those who are engaged in the management of public affairs are more subject to excitement and to be led astray by their particular interests and passions than the great body of our constituents who living at home in the pursuit of their ordinary avocations are calm but deeply interested spectators of events and of the conduct of those who are parties to them. To the people every department of the Government and every inual in each are responsible and the more full their information the better they can judge of the wisdom of the policy pursued and of the conduct of each in regard to it. From their dispassionate judgment much a may always be obtained while their approbation will form the greatest incentive and most gratifying reward for virtuous actions and the dread of their censure the best security against the abuse of their confence. Their interests in all vital questions are the same and the bond by sentiment as well as by interest will be proportionably strengthened as they are better informed of the real state of public affairs especially in difficult conjunctures. It is by such knowledge that local prejudices and jealousies are surmounted and that a national policy extending its fostering care and protection to all the great interests of our Union is formed and steadily adhered to. A precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our negotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particularly necessary. Equally necessary is it that we should for a just estimate of our resources revenue and progress in every kind of improvement connected with the national prosperity and public defense. It is by rendering justice to other nations that we may expect it from them. It is by our ability to resent injuries and redress wrongs that we may avo them. The commissioners under the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent having disagreed in their opinions respecting that portion of the boundary between the Territories of the United States and of Great Britain the establishment of which had been submitted to them have made their respective reports in compliance with that article that the same might be referred to the decision of a friendly power. It being manifest however that it would be difficult if not impossible for any power to perform that office without great delay and much inconvenience to itself a proposal has been made by this Government and acceded to by that of Great Britain to endeavor to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation. It appearing from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be formed of the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British colonies in this hemisphere by legislative acts while each party pursued its own course without agreement or concert with the other a proposal has been made to the British Government to regulate this commerce by treaty as it has been to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizens of the United States inhabiting the States and Territories bordering on the lakes and rivers which empty into the St. Lawrence to the igation of that river to the ocean. For these and other objects of high importance to the interests of both parties a negotiation has been opened with the British Government which it is hoped will have a satisfactory result. The commissioners under the 6th and 7th articles of the treaty of Ghent having successfully closed their labors in relation to the 6th have proceeded to the discharge of those relating to the 7th. Their progress in the extensive survey required for the performance of their duties justifies the presumption that it will be completed in the ensuing year. The negotiation which had been long depending with the French Government on several important subjects and particularly for a just indemnity for losses sustained in the late wars by the citizens of the United States under unjustifiable seizures and confiscations of their property has not as yet had the desired effect. As this claim rests on the same principle with others which have been admitted by the French Government it is not perceived on what just ground it can be rejected. A minister will be immediately appointed to proceed to France and resume the negotiation on this and other subjects which may arise between the two nations. At the proposal of the Russian Imperial Government made through the minister of the Emperor resing here a full power and instructions have been transmitted to the minister of the United States at St. Petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interests of the two nations on the North West coast of this continent. A similar proposal had been made by His Imperial Majesty to the Government of Great Britain which has likewise been acceded to. The Government of the United States has been desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifesting the great value which they have invariably attached to the friendship of the Emperor and their solicitude to cultivate the best understanding with his Government. In the discussions to which this interest has given rise and in the arrangements by which they may terminate the occasion has been judged proper for asserting as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved that the American continents by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain are henceforth not to be consered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. Since the close of the last session of Congress the commissioners and arbitrators for ascertaining and determining the amount of indemnification which may be due to citizens of the United States under the decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia in conformity to the convention concluded at St. Petersburg on [18220712] have assembled in this city and organized themselves as a board for the performance of the duties assigned to them by that treaty. The commission constituted under the 11th article of the treaty of [18190222] between the United States and Spain is also in session here and as the term of three years limited by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of the next regular meeting of Congress the attention of the Legislature will be drawn to the measures which may be necessary to accomplish the objects for which the commission was instituted. In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives adopted at their last session instructions have been given to all the ministers of the United States accredited to the powers of Europe and America to propose the proscription of the African slave trade by ing it under the denomination and inflicting on its perpetrators the punishment of piracy. Should this proposal be acceded to it is not doubted that this odious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppressed. It is earnestly hoped that it will be acceded to from the firm belief that it is the most effectual expedient that can be adopted for the purpose. At the commencement of the recent war between France and Spain it was declared by the French Government that it would grant no commissions to privateers and that neither the commerce of Spain herself nor of neutral nations should be molested by the al force of France except in the breach of a lawful ade. This declaration which appears to have been faithfully carried into effect concurring with principles proclaimed and cherished by the United States from the first establishment of their independence suggested the hope that the time had arrived when the proposal for adopting it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future maritime wars might meet the favorable conseration of the great European powers. Instructions have accordingly been given to our ministers with France Russia and Great Britain to make those proposals to their respective Governments and when the friends of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great facility by which it might be accomplished requiring only the consent of a few sovereigns an earnest hope is indulged that these overtures will meet with an attention animated by the spirit in which they were made and that they will ultimately be successful. The ministers who were appointed to the Republics of Colombia and Buenos Ayres during the last session of Congress proceeded shortly afterwards to their destinations. Of their arrival there official intelligence has not yet been received. The minister appointed to the Republic of Chile will sail in a few days. An early appointment will also be made to Mexico. A minister has been received from Colombia and the other Governments have been informed that ministers or diplomatic agents of inferior grade would be received from each accordingly as they might prefer the one or the other. The minister appointed to Spain proceeded soon after his appointment for Cadiz the resence of the Sovereign to whom he was accredited. In approaching that port the frigate which conveyed him was warned off by the commander of the French squadron by which it was aded and not permitted to enter although apprised by the captain of the frigate of the public character of the person whom he had on board the landing of whom was the sole object of his proposed entry. This act being consered an infringement of the rights of ambassadors and of nations will form a just cause of complaint to the Government of France against the officer by whom it was committed. The actual condition of the public finances more than realizes the favorable anticipations that were entertained of it at the opening of the last session of Congress. On the first of January there was a balance in the Treasury of $4237427.55. From that time to the 30th of September the receipts amounted to upward of $16.1M and the expenditures to $11.4M. During the 4th quarter of the year it is estimated that the receipts will at least equal the expenditures and that there will remain in the Treasury on the first day of January next a surplus of nearly $9M. On [18250101] a large amount of the war debt and a part of the Revolutionary debt become redeemable. Additional portions of the former will continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835. it is believed however that if the United States remain at peace the whole of that debt may be redeemed by the ordinary revenue of those years during that period under the provision of the act of [18170303] creating the sinking fund and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain after the year 1835 will be the $7M of 5% stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States and the 3% Revolutionary debt amounting to $13296099.06 both of which are redeemable at the pleasure of the Government. The state of the Army in its organization and discipline has been gradually improving for several years and has now attained a high degree of perfection. The military disbursements have been regularly made and the accounts regularly and promptly rendered for settlement. The supplies of various descriptions have been of good quality and regularly issued at all of the posts. A system of economy and accountability has been introduced into every branch of the service which admits of little additional improvement. This desirable state has been attained by the act reorganizing the staff of the Army passed on [18180414]. The moneys appropriated for fortifications have been regularly and economically applied and all the works advanced as raply as the amount appropriated would admit. Three important works will be completed in the course of this year  that is Fort Washington Fort Delaware and the fort at the Rigolets in Louisiana. The Board of Engineers and the Topographical Corps have been in constant and active service in surveying the coast and projecting the works necessary for its defense. The Military Academy has attained a degree of perfection in its discipline and instruction equal as is believed to any institution of its kind in any country. The money appropriated for the use of the Ordnance Department has been regularly and economically applied. The fabrication of arms at the national armories and by contract with the Department has been gradually improving in quality and cheapness. It is believed that their quality is now such as to admit of but little improvement. The completion of the fortifications renders it necessary that there should be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricating the cannon and carriages necessary for those works. Under the appropriation of $5000 for exploring the Western waters for the location of a site for a Western armory a commission was constituted consisting of Colonel McRee Colonel Lee and Captain Talcott who have been engaged in exploring the country. They have not yet reported the result of their labors but it is believed that they will be prepared to do it at an early part of the session of Congress. During the month of June last General Ashley and his party who were trading under a license from the Government were attacked by the Ricarees while peaceably trading with the Indians at their request. Several of the party were killed and wounded and their property taken or destroyed. Colonel Leavenworth who commanded Fort Atkinson at the Council Bluffs the most western post apprehending that the hostile spirit of the Ricarees would extend to other tribes in that quarter and that thereby the lives of the traders on the Missouri and the peace of the frontier would be endangered took immediate measures to check the evil. With a detachment of the regiment stationed at the Bluffs he successfully attacked the Ricaree village and it is hoped that such an impression has been made on them as well as on the other tribes on the Missouri as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility. The report of the Secretary of War which is herewith transmitted will exhibit in greater detail the condition of the Department in its various branches and the progress which has been made in its administration during the three first quarters of the year. I transmit a return of the militia of the several States according to the last reports which have been made by the proper officers in each to the Department of War. by reference to this return it will be seen that it is not complete although great exertions have been made to make it so. As the defense and even the liberties of the country must depend in times of imminent danger on the militia it is of the highest importance that it be well organized armed and disciplined throughout the Union. The report of the Secretary of War shews the progress made during the three first quarters of the present year by the application of the fund appropriated for arming the militia. Much difficulty is found in distributing the arms according to the act of Congress proving for it from the failure of the proper departments in many of the States to make regular returns. The act of [18200512] proves that the system of tactics and regulations of the various corps of the Regular Army shall be extended to the militia. This act has been very imperfectly executed from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia proceeding from the defects of the system itself and especially in its application to that main arm of the public defense. It is thought that this important subject in all its branches merits the attention of Congress. The report of the Secretary of the Navy which is now communicated furnishes an account of the administration of that Department for the three first quarters of the present year with the progress made in augmenting the Navy and the manner in which the vessels in commission have been employed. The usual force has been maintained in the Mediterranean Sea the Pacific Ocean and along the Atlantic coast and has afforded the necessary protection to our commerce in those seas. In the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico our al force has been augmented by the addition of several small vessels proved for by the act authorizing an additional al force for the suppression of piracy passed by Congress at their last session. That armament has been eminently successful in the accomplishment of its object. The piracies by which our commerce in the neighborhood of the island of Cuba had been afflicted have been repressed and the confence of our merchants in a great measure restored. The patriotic zeal and enterprise of Commodore Porter to whom the command of the expedition was confed has been fully seconded by the officers and men under his command. And in reflecting with high satisfaction on the honorable manner in which they have sustained the reputation of their country and its Navy the sentiment is alloyed only by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the diseases incent to the season and to the climate in which it was discharged have deprived the nation of many useful lives and among them of several officers of great promise. In the month of August a very malignant fever made its appearance at Thompsons Island which threatened the destruction of our station there. Many perished and the commanding officer was severely attacked. Uncertain as to his fate and knowing that most of the medical officers had been rendered incapable of discharging their duties it was thought expedient to send to that post an officer of rank and experience with several skilled surgeons to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its recurrence there in future seasons; to furnish every assistance to those who were suffering and if practicable to avo the necessity of abandoning so important a station. Commodore Rodgers with a promptitude which d him honor cheerfully accepted that trust and has discharged it in the manner anticipated from his skill and patriotism. Before his arrival Commodore Porter with the greater part of the squadron had removed from the island and returned to the United States in consequence of the prevailing sickness. Much useful information has however been obtained as to the state of the island and great relief afforded to those who had been necessarily left there. Although our expedition cooperating with an invigorated administration of the government of the island of Cuba and with the corresponding active exertions of a British al force in the same seas have almost entirely destroyed the unlicensed piracies from that island the success of our exertions has not been equally effectual to suppress the same crime under other pretenses and colors in the neighboring island of Porto Rico. They have been committed there under the abusive issue of Spanish commissions. At an early period of the present year remonstrances were made to the governor of that island by an agent who was sent for the purpose against those outrages on the peaceful commerce of the United States of which many had occurred. That officer professing his own want of authority to make satisfaction for our just complaints answered only by a reference of them to the Government of Spain. The minister of the United States to that court was specially instructed to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual interposition of that Government directing restitution and indemnity for wrongs already committed and interdicting the repetition of them. The minister as has been seen was debarred access to the Spanish Government and in the mean time several new cases of flagrant outrage have occurred and citizens of the United States in the island of Porto Rico have suffered and others been threatened with assassination for asserting their unquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunals of the country. The usual orders have been given to all our public ships to seize American vessels in the slave trade and bring them in for adjudication and I have the gratification to state that not one so employed has been discovered and there is good reason to believe that our flag is now seldom if at all disgraced by that traffic. It is a source of great satisfaction that we are always enabled to recur to the conduct of our Navy with price and commendation. As a means of national defense it enjoys the public confence and is steadily assuming additional importance. It is submitted whether a more efficient and equally economical organization of it might not in several respects be effected. It is supposed that higher grades than now exist by law would be useful. They would afford wellmerited rewards to those who have long and faithfully served their country present the best incentives to good conduct and the best means of insuring a proper discipline; destroy the inequality in that respect between military and al services and relieve our officers from many inconveniences and mortifications which occur when our vessels meet those of other nations ours being the only service in which such grades do not exist. A report of the PostMasterGeneral which accompanies this communication will shew the present state of the PostOffice Department and its general operations for some years past. There is established by law 88600 miles of post roads on which the mail is now transported 85700 miles and contracts have been made for its transportation on all the established routes with one or 2 exceptions. There are 5240 post offices in the Union and as many post masters. The gross amount of postage which accrued from [18220701] to [18230701] was $1114345.12. During the same period the expenditures of the PostOffice Department amounted to $1169885.51 and consisted of the following items viz:Compensation to post masters $353995.98; incental expenses $30866.37; transportation of the mail $784600.08; payments into the Treasury $423.08. On the first of July last there was due to the Department from post masters $135245.28; from late post masters and contractors $256749.31; making a total amount of balances due to the Department of $391994.59.These balances embrace all delinquencies of post masters and contractors which have taken place since the organization of the Department. There was due by the Department to contractors on the first of July last $26548.64. The transportation of the mail within five years past has been greatly extended and the expenditures of the Department proportionably increased. Although the postage which has accrued within the last three years has fallen short of the expenditures $262821.46 it appears that collections have been made from the outstanding balances to meet the principal part of the current demands. It is estimated that not more than $250000 of the above balances can be collected and that a conserable part of this sum can only be realized by a resort to legal process. Some improvements in the receipts for postage is expected. A prompt attention to the collection of moneys received by post masters it is believed will enable the Department to continue its operations without a from the Treasury unless the expenditures shall be increased by the establishment of new mail routes. A revision of some parts of the post office law may be necessary; and it is submitted whether it would not be proper to prove for the appointment of post masters where the compensation exceeds a certain amount by nomination to the Senate as other officers of the General Government are appointed. Having communicated my s to Congress at the commencement of the last session respecting the encouragement which ought to be given to our manufactures and the principle on which it should be founded I have only to add that those s remain unchanged and that the present state of those countries with which we have the most immediate political relations and greatest commercial intercourse tends to confirm them. Under this impression I recommend a re of the tariff for the purpose of affording such additional protection to those articles which we are prepared to manufacture or which are more immediately connected with the defense and independence of the country. The actual state of the public accounts furnishes additional evence of the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the public expenditure. Of the moneys drawn from the Treasury since [18170304] the sum remaining unaccounted for on the 30th of September last is more than $1.5M less than on the 30th of September preceding; and during the same period a reduction of nearly $1M has been made in the amount of the unsettled accounts for moneys advanced previously to [18170304]. It will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of accounts of the latter description is diminished by settlement the difficulty of settling the resue is increased from the conseration that in many instances it can be obtained only by legal process. For more precise details on this subject I refer to a report from the first Comptroller of the Treasury. The sum which was appropriated at the last session for the repairs of the Cumberland road has been applied with good effect to that object. A final report has not been received from the agent who was appointed to superintend it. As soon as it is received it shall be communicated to Congress. Many patriotic and enlightened citizens who have made the subject an object of particular investigation have suggested an improvement of still greater importance. They are of the opinion that the waters of the Chesapeake and Ohio may be connected together by one continued canal and at an expense far short of the value and importance of the object to be obtained. If this could be accomplished it is impossible to calculate the beneficial consequences which would result from it. A great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it would pass would find a market through that channel. Troops might be moved with great facility in war with cannon and every kind of munition and in either direction. Connecting the Atlantic with the Western country in a line passing through the seat of the National Government it would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself. Believing as I do that Congress possess the right to appropriate money for such a national object (the jurisdiction remaining to the States through which the canal would pass) I submit it to your conseration whether it may not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the officers of the Corps of Engineers to examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report their opinion thereon. It will likewise be proper to extend their examination to the several routes through which the waters of the Ohio may be connected by canals with those of Lake Erie. As the Cumberland road will require annual repairs and Congress have not thought it expedient to recommend to the States an amendment to the Constitution for the purpose of vesting in the United States a power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement it is also submitted to your conseration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the Executive to enter into an arrangement with the several States through which the road passes to establish tolls each within its limits for the purpose of defraying the expense of future repairs and of proving also by suitable penalties for its protection against future injuries. The act of Congress of [18220507] appropriated the sum of $22700 for the purpose of erecting two piers as a shelter for vessels from ice near Cape Henlopen Delaware Bay. To effect the object of the act the officers of the Board of Engineers with Commodore Bainbrge were directed to prepare plans and estimates of piers sufficient to answer the purpose intended by the act. It appears by their report which accompanies the documents from the War Department that the appropriation is not adequate to the purpose intended; and as the piers would be of great service both to the igation of the Delaware Bay and the protection of vessels on the adjacent parts of the coast I submit for the conseration of Congress whether additional and sufficient appropriations should not be made. The Board of Engineers were also directed to examine and survey the entrance of the harbor of the port of Presquille in PA in order to make an estimate of the expense of removing the obstructions to the entrance with a plan of the best mode of effecting the same under the appropriation for that purpose by act of Congress passed 3rd of March last. The report of the Board accompanies the papers from the War Department and is submitted for the conseration of Congress. A strong hope has been long entertained founded on the heroic struggle of the Greeks that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth. It is believed that the whole civilized world take a deep interest in their welfare. Although no power has declared in their favor yet none according to our information has taken part against them. Their cause and their name have protected them from dangers which might ere this have overwhelmed any other people. The ordinary calculations of interest and of acquisition with a  to aggrandizement which mingles so much in the transactions of nations seem to have had no effect in regard to them. From the facts which have come to our knowledge there is good cause to believe that their enemy has lost forever all dominion over them; that Greece will become again an independent nation. That she may obtain that rank is the object of our most ardent wishes. It was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort was then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people of those countries and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation. It need scarcely be remarked that the result has been so far very different from what was then anticipated. Of events in that quarter of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin we have always been anxious and interested spectators. The citizens of the United States cherish sentiments the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow men on that se of the Atlantic. In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part nor does it comport with our policy so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defense. With the movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity this whole nation is devoted. We owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should conser any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered
and shall not interfere but with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it and whose independence we have on great conseration and on just principles acknowledged we could not  any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. In the war between those new Governments and Spain we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition and to this we have adhered and shall continue to adhere proved no change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent authorities of this Government shall make a corresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to their security. The late events in Spain and Portugal shew that Europe is still unsettled. Of this important fact no stronger proof can be adduced than that the allied powers should have thought it proper on any principle satisfactory to themselves to have interposed by force in the internal concerns of Spain. To what extent such interposition may be carried on the same principle is a question in which all independent powers whose governments differ from theirs are interested even those most remote and surely none more so than the United States. Our policy in regard to Europe which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe nevertheless remains the same which is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers; to conser the government de facto as the legitimate government for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it and to preserve those relations by a frank firm and manly policy meeting in all instances the just claims of every power submitting to injuries from none. But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different. It is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren if left to themselves would adopt it of their own accord. It is equally impossible therefore that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference. If we look to the comparative strength and resources of Spain and those new Governments and their distance from each other it must be obvious that she can never subdue them. It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course. If we compare the present condition of our Union with its actual state at the close of our Revolution the history of the world furnishes no example of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstances which constitute the happiness of a nation which bears any resemblance to it. At the first epoch our population d not exceed 3000000. by the last census it amounted to about 10000000 and what is more extraordinary it is almost altogether native for the immigration from other countries has been inconserable. At the first epoch half the territory within our acknowledged limits was uninhabited and a wilderness. Since then new territory has been acquired of vast extent comprising within it many rivers particularly the Mississippi the igation of which to the ocean was of the highest importance to the original States. Over this territory our population has expanded in every direction and new States have been established almost equal in number to those which formed the first bond of our Union. This expansion of our population and accession of new States to our Union have had the happiest effect on all its highest interests. That it has eminently augmented our resources and added to our strength and respectability as a power is admitted by all but it is not in these important circumstances only that this happy effect is felt. It is manifest that by enlarging the basis of our system and increasing the number of States the system itself has been greatly strengthened in both its branches. Consolation and disunion have thereby been rendered equally impracticable. Each Government confing in its own strength has less to apprehend from the other and in consequence each enjoying a greater freedom of action is rendered more efficient for all the purposes for which it was instituted. It is unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement made in the system itself by the adoption of this Constitution and of its happy effect in elevating the character and in protecting the rights of the nation as well as inuals. To what then do we owe these blessings? It is known to all that we derive them from the excellence of our institutions. Ought we not then to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate them? 
<p alignleft FRIENDS AND FELLOWCITIZENS < Called upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellowcitizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents and that I approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire. A rising nation spread over a we and fruitful land traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right advancing raply to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye  when I con these transcendent objects and see the honor the happiness and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day I shrink from the contemplation and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking. Utterly indeed should I despair d not the presence of many whom I here see remind me that in the other high authorities proved by our Constitution I shall find resources of wisdom of virtue and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties. To you then gentlemen who are charged with the sovereign s of legislation and to those associated with you I look with encouragement for that guance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amst the conflicting elements of a troubled world. During the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think; but this being now deced by the voice of the nation announced according to the rules of the Constitution all will of course arrange themselves under the will of the law and unite in common efforts for the common good. All too will bear in mind this sacred principle that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights which equal law must protect and to violate would be oppression. Let us then fellowcitizens unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic as wicked and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man seeking through blood and slaughter his longlost liberty it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others and should e opinions as to measures of safety. But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it. I know indeed that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong that this Government is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot in the full te of successful experiment abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Government the world's best hope may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this on the contrary the strongest Government on earth. I believe it the only one where every man at the call of the law would fly to the standard of the law and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is sa that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question. Let us then with courage and confence pursue our own Federal and Republican principles our attachment to union and representative government. Kindly separated by nature and a we ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe; too highminded to endure the degradations of the others; possessing a chosen country with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation; entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties to the acquisitions of our own industry to honor and confence from our fellowcitizens resulting not from birth but from our actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion professed indeed and practiced in various forms yet all of them inculcating honesty truth temperance gratitude and the love of man; acknowledging and adoring an overruling Provence which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter  with all these blessings what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing more fellowcitizens  a wise and frugal Government which shall restrain men from injuring one another shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities. About to enter fellowcitizens on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you it is proper you should understand what I deem the essential principles of our Government and consequently those which ought to shape its Administration. I will compress them within the narrowest compass they will bear stating the general principle but not all its limitations. Equal and exact justice to all men of whatever state or persuasion religious or political; peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none; the support of the State governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies; the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a jealous care of the right of election by the people  a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unproved; absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority the vital principle of republics from which is no appeal but to force the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism; a welldisciplined militia our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over the military authority; economy in the public expense that labor may be lightly burthened; the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement of agriculture and of commerce as its handma; the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason; freedom of religion; freedom of the press and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus and trial by juries impartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and gued our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment. They should be the creed of our political faith the text of civic instruction the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace liberty and safety. I repair then fellowcitizens to the post you have assigned me. With experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest of all I have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and the favor which bring him into it. Without pretensions to that high confence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary character whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place in his country's love and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history I ask so much confence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall often go wrong through defect of judgment. When right I shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command a  of the whole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own errors which will never be intentional and your support against the errors of others who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts. The approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all. Relying then on the patronage of your good will I advance with obedience to the work ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice it is in your power to make. And may that Infinite Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity.
During the wars which for some time have unhappily prevailed among the powers of Europe the United States of America firm in their principles of peace have endeavored by justice by a regular discharge of all their national and social duties and by every friendly office their situation has admitted to maintain with all the belligerents their accustomed relations of friendship hospitality and commercial intercourse. Taking no part in the questions which animate these powers against each other nor permitting themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed and they believe that no instance of a departure from its duties can be justly imputed to them by any nation. A free use of their harbors and waters the means of refitting and of refreshment of succor to their sick and suffering have at all times and on equal principles been extended to all and this too amst a constant recurrence of acts of insubordination to the laws of violence to the persons and of trespasses on the property of our citizens committed by officers of one of the belligerent parties received among us. In truth these abuses of the laws of hospitality have with few exceptions become habitual to the commanders of the British armed vessels hovering on our coasts and frequenting our harbors. They have been the subject of repeated representations to their Government. Assurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them within the limits of the rights and of the respect due to a friendly nation; but those orders and assurances have been without effectno instance of punishment for past wrongs has taken place. At length a deed transcending all we have hitherto seen or suffered brings the public sensibility to a serious crisis and our forbearance to a necessary pause. A frigate of the United States trusting to a state of peace and leaving her harbor on a distant service has been surprised and attacked by a British vessel of superior forceone of a squadron then lying in our waters and covering the transactionand has been disabled from service with the loss of a number of men killed and wounded. This enormity was not only without provocation or justifiable cause but was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force from a ship of war of the United States a part of her crew; and that no circumstance might be wanting to mark its character it had been previously ascertained that the seamen demanded were native citizens of the United States. Having effected her purpose she returned to anchor with her squadron within our jurisdiction. Hospitality under such circumstances ceases to be a duty and a continuance of it with such uncontrolled abuses would tend only by multiplying injuries and irritations to bring on a rupture between the two nations. This extreme resort is equally opposed to the interests of both as it is to assurances of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the British Government in the mst of which this outrage has been committed. In this light the subject can not but present itself to that Government and strengthen the motives to an honorable reparation of the wrong which has been done and to that effectual control of its al commanders which alone can justify the Government of the United States in the exercise of those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.In conseration of these circumstances and of the right of every nation to regulate its own police to prove for its peace and for the safety of its citizens and consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessels into its harbors or waters either in such numbers or of such descriptions as are inconsistent with these or with the maintenance of the authority of the laws I have thought proper in pursuance of the authorities specially given by law to issue this my proclamation hereby requiring all armed vessels bearing commissions under the Government of Great Britain now within the harbors or waters of the United States immediately and without any delay to depart from the same and interdicting the entrance of all the sa harbors and waters to the sa armed vessels and to all others bearing commissions under the authority Of the British Government.And if the sa vessels or any of them shall fall to depart as aforesa or if they or any others so interdicted shall hereafter enter the harbors or waters aforesa I do in that case forb all intercourse with them or any of them their officers or crews and do prohibit all supplies and a from being furnished to them or any of them.And I do declare and make known that if any person from or within the jurisdictional limits of the United States shall afford any a to any such vessel contrary to the prohibition contained in this proclamation either in repairing any such vessel or in furnishing her her officers or crew with supplies of any kind or in any manner whatsoever; or if any pilot shall assist in igating any of the sa armed vessels unless it be for the purpose of carrying them in the first instance beyond the limits and jurisdiction of the United States or unless it be in the case of a vessel forced by distress or charged with public dispatches as hereinafter proved for such person or persons shall on conviction suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws proved for such offenses.And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office civil or military within or under the authority of the United States and all others citizens or inhabitants thereof or being within the same with vigilance and promptitude to exert their respective authorities and to be aing and assisting to the carrying this proclamation and every part thereof into full effect.Proved nevertheless that if any such vessel shall be forced into the harbors or waters of the United States by distress by the dangers of the sea or by the pursuit of an enemy or shall enter them charged with dispatches or business from their Government or shall be a public packet for the conveyance of letters and dispatches the commanding officer immediately reporting his vessel to the collector of the district stating the object or causes of entering the sa harbors or waters and conforming himself to the regulations in that case prescribed under the authority of the laws shall be allowed the benefit of such regulations respecting repairs supplies stay intercourse and departure as shall be permitted under the same authority.In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents and signed the same.Given at the city of Washington the 2d day of July A. D. 1807 and of the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States the thirtyfirst.TH: JEFFERSON.By the Present:JAMES MADISON Secretary of State.
MY FRIENDS AND CHILDREN CHIEFLY OF THE CHEROKEE NATION  Having now finished our business an to mutual satisfaction I cannot take leave of you without expressing the satisfaction I have received from your visit. I see with my own eyes that the endeavors we have been making to encourage and lead you in the way of improving your situation have not been unsuccessful; it has been like grain sown in good ground producing abundantly. You are becoming farmers learning the use of the plough and the hoe enclosing your grounds and employing that labor in their cultivation which you formerly employed in hunting and in war; and I see handsome specimens of cotton cloth raised spun and wove by yourselves. You are also raising cattle and hogs for your food and horses to assist your labors. Go on my children in the same way and be assured the further you advance in it the happier and more respectable you will be.  Our brethren whom you have happened to meet here from the West and Northwest have enabled you to compare your situation now with what it was formerly. They also make the comparison and they see how far you are ahead of them and seeing what you are they are encouraged to do as you have done. You will find your next want to be mills to grind your corn which by relieving your women from the loss of time in beating it into meal will enable them to spin and weave more. When a man has enclosed and improved his farm builds a good house on it and raised plentiful stocks of animals he will wish when he dies that these things shall go to his wife and children whom he loves more than he does his other relations and for whom he will work with pleasure during his life. You will therefore find it necessary to establish laws for this. When a man has property earned by his own labor he will not like to see another come and take it from him because he happens to be stronger or else to defend it by spilling blood. You will find it necessary then to appoint good men as judges to dece contests between man and man according to reason and to the rules you shall establish. If you wish to be aed by our counsel and experience in these things we shall always be ready to assist you with our advice. My children it is unnecessary for me to advise you against spending all your time and labor in warring with and destroying your fellowmen and wasting your own members. You already see the folly and iniquity of it. Your young men however are not yet sufficiently sensible of it. Some of them cross the Mississippi to go and destroy people who have never done them an injury. My children this is wrong and must not be; if we permit them to cross the Mississippi to war with the Indians on the other se of that river we must let those Indians cross the river to take revenge on you. I say again this must not be. The Mississippi now belongs to us. It must not be a river of blood. It is now the waterpath along which all our people of Natchez St. Louis Indiana Ohio Tennessee Kentucky and the western parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia are constantly passing with their property to and from New Orleans. Young men going to war are not easily restrained. Finding our people on the river they will rob them perhaps kill them. This would bring on a war between us and you. It is better to stop this in time by forbding your young men to go across the river to make war. If they go to visit or to live with the Cherokees on the other se of the river we shall not object to that. That country is ours. We will permit them to live in it. My children this is what I wished to say to you. To go on in learning to cultivate the earth and to avo war. If any of your neighbors injure you our beloved men whom we place with you will endeavor to obtain justice for you and we will support them in it. If any of your bad people injure your neighbors be ready to acknowledge it and to do them justice. It is more honorable to repair a wrong than to persist in it. Tell all your chiefs your men women and children that I take them by the hand and hold it fast. That I am their father wish their happiness and wellbeing and am always ready to promote their good. My children I thank you for your visit and pray to the Great Spirit who made us all and planted us all in this land to live together like brothers that will conduct you safely to your homes and grant you to find your families and your friends in good health. 
Whereas the territory south of the Mississippi Territory and eastward of the river Mississippi and extending to the river Perdo of which possession was not delivered to the United States in pursuance of the treaty concluded at Paris on the 30th April 1803 has at all times as is well known been consered and claimed by them as being within the colony of Louisiana conveyed by the sa treaty in the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain and that it had when France originally possessed it; andWhereas the acquiescence of the United States in the temporary continuance of the sa territory under the Spanish authority was not the result of any distrust of their title as has been particularly evinced by the general tenor of their laws and by the distinction made in the application of those laws between that territory and foreign countries but was occasioned by their conciliatory s and by a confence in the justice of their cause and in the success of cand discussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly power; andWhereas a satisfactory adjustment too long delayed without the fault of the United States has for some time been entirely suspended by events over which they had no control; andWhereas a crisis has at length arrived subversive of the order of things under the Spanish authorities whereby a failure of the United States to take the sa territory into its possession may lead to events ultimately contravening the s of both parties whilst in the meantime the tranquillity and security of our adjoining territories are endangered and new facilities given to violations of our revenue and commercial laws and of those prohibiting the introduction of slaves:Consering moreover that under these peculiar and imperative circumstances a forbearance on the part of the United States to occupy the territory in question and thereby guard against the confusions and contingencies which threaten it might be construed into a dereliction of their title or an insensibility to the importance of the stake; consering that in the hands of the United States it will not cease to be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment; consering finally that the acts of Congress though contemplating a present possession by a foreign authority have cond also an eventual possession of the sa territory by the United States and are accordingly so framed as in that case to extend in their operation to the same:Now be it known that I James Madison Present of the United States of America in pursuance of these weighty and urgent conserations have deemed it right and requisite that possession should be taken of the sa territory in the name and behalf of the United States. William C. C. Claiborne governor of the Orleans Territory of which the sa Territory is to be taken as part will accordingly proceed to execute the same and to exercise over the sa Territory the authorities and s legally appertaining to his office; and the good people inhabiting the same are invited and enjoined to pay due respect to him in that character to be obedient to the laws to maintain order to cherish harmony and in every manner to conduct themselves as peaceable citizens under full assurance that they will be protected in the enjoyment of their liberty property and religion.In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed and signed the same with my hand.Done at the city of Washington the 27th day of October A.D. 1810 and in the thirtyfifth year of the Independence of the sa United States.JAMES MADISON.By the Present:R. SMITHSecretary of State.
I should be destitute of feeling if I was not deeply affected by the strong proof which my fellowcitizens have given me of their confence in calling me to the high office whose s I am about to assume. As the expression of their good opinion of my conduct in the public service I derive from it a gratification which those who are conscious of having done all that they could to merit it can alone feel. My sensibility is increased by a just estimate of the importance of the trust and of the nature and extent of its duties with the proper discharge of which the highest interests of a great and free people are intimately connected. Conscious of my own deficiency I cannot enter on these duties without great anxiety for the result. From a just responsibility I will never shrink calculating with confence that in my best efforts to promote the public welfare my motives will always be duly appreciated and my conduct be ed with that candor and indulgence which I have experienced in other stations.  In commencing the duties of the chief executive office it has been the practice of the distinguished men who have gone before me to explain the principles which would govern them in their respective Administrations. In following their venerated example my attention is naturally drawn to the great causes which have contributed in a principal degree to produce the present happy condition of the United States. They will best explain the nature of our duties and shed much light on the policy which ought to be pursued in future. From the commencement of our Revolution to the present day almost forty years have elapsed and from the establishment of this Constitution twentyeight. Through this whole term the Government has been what may emphatically be called selfgovernment. And what has been the effect? To whatever object we turn our attention whether it relates to our foreign or domestic concerns we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in the excellence of our institutions. During a period fraught with difficulties and marked by very extraordinary events the United States have flourished beyond example. Their citizens inually have been happy and the nation prosperous. Under this Constitution our commerce has been wisely regulated with foreign nations and between the States; new States have been admitted into our Union; our territory has been enlarged by fair and honorable treaty and with great advantage to the original States; the States respectively protected by the National Government under a mild parental system against foreign dangers and enjoying within their separate spheres by a wise partition of power a just proportion of the sovereignty have improved their police extended their settlements and attained a strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholesome laws well administered. And if we look to the condition of inuals what a proud spectacle does it exhibit! On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property? Who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he prefers to the Divine Author of his being? It is well known that all these blessings have been enjoyed in their fullest extent; and I add with peculiar satisfaction that there has been no example of a capital punishment being inflicted on anyone for the crime of high treason. Some who might admit the competency of our Government to these beneficent duties might doubt it in trials which put to the test its strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nations. Here too experience has afforded us the most satisfactory proof in its favor. Just as this Constitution was put into action several of the principal States of Europe had become much agitated and some of them seriously convulsed. Destructive wars ensued which have of late only been terminated. In the course of these conflicts the United States received great injury from several of the parties. It was their interest to stand aloof from the contest to demand justice from the party committing the injury and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all. War became at length inevitable and the result has shown that our Government is equal to that the greatest of trials under the most unfavorable circumstances. Of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploits of the Army the Navy and the militia I need not speak. Such then is the happy Government under which we livea Government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed; a Government elective in all its branches under which every citizen may by his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the Constitution; which contains within it no cause of discord none to put at variance one portion of the community with another; a Government which protects every citizen in the full enjoyment of his rights and is able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign powers. Other conserations of the highest importance admonish us to cherish our Union and to cling to the Government which supports it. Fortunate as we are in our political institutions we have not been less so in other circumstances on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend. Situated within the temperate zone and extending through many degrees of latitude along the Atlantic the United States enjoy all the varieties of climate and every production incent to that portion of the globe. Penetrating internally to the Great Lakes and beyond the sources of the great rivers which communicate through our whole interior no country was ever happier with respect to its domain. Blessed too with a fertile soil our produce has always been very abundant leaving even in years the least favorable a surplus for the wants of our fellowmen in other countries. Such is our peculiar felicity that there is not a part of our Union that is not particularly interested in preserving it. The great agricultural interest of the nation prospers under its protection. Local interests are not less fostered by it. Our fellowcitizens of the North engaged in igation find great encouragement in being made the favored carriers of the vast productions of the other portions of the United States while the inhabitants of these are amply recompensed in their turn by the nursery for seamen and al force thus formed and reared up for the support of our common rights. Our manufactures find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry and the surplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in lessfavored parts at home. Such then being the highly favored condition of our country it is the interest of every citizen to maintain it. What are the dangers which menace us? If any exist they ought to be ascertained and guarded against. In explaining my sentiments on this subject it may be asked What raised us to the present happy state? How d we accomplish the Revolution? How remedy the defects of the first instrument of our Union by infusing into the National Government sufficient power for national purposes without impairing the just rights of the States or affecting those of inuals? How sustain and pass with glory through the late war? The Government has been in the hands of the people. To the people therefore and to the faithful and able depositaries of their trust is the credit due. Had the people of the United States been educated in different principles had they been less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can it be believed that we should have maintained the same steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success? While then the constituent body retains its present sound and healthful state everything will be safe. They will choose competent and faithful representatives for every department. It is only when the people become ignorant and corrupt when they degenerate into a populace that they are incapable of exercising the sovereignty. Usurpation is then an easy attainment and an usurper soon found. The people themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement and ruin. Let us then look to the great cause and endeavor to preserve it in full force. Let us by all wise and constitutional measures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of preserving our liberties. Dangers from abroad are not less deserving of attention. Experiencing the fortune of other nations the United States may be again involved in war and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset our Government to break our Union and demolish us as a nation. Our distance from Europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of our Government may form some security against these dangers but they ought to be anticipated and guarded against. Many of our citizens are engaged in commerce and igation and all of them are in a certain degree dependent on their prosperous state. Many are engaged in the fisheries. These interests are exposed to invasion in the wars between other powers and we should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if we d not expect it. We must support our rights or lose our character and with it perhaps our liberties. A people who fail to do it can scarcely be sa to hold a place among independent nations. National honor is national property of the highest value. The sentiment in the mind of every citizen is national strength. It ought therefore to be cherished. To secure us against these dangers our coast and inland frontiers should be fortified our Army and Navy regulated upon just principles as to the force of each be kept in perfect order and our militia be placed on the best practicable footing. To put our extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will be attended with expense but the work when finished will be permanent and it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a al force superior to our own aed by a few thousand land troops would expose us to greater expense without taking into the estimate the loss of property and distress of our citizens than would be sufficient for this great work. Our land and al forces should be moderate but adequate to the necessary purposesthe former to garrison and preserve our fortifications and to meet the first invasions of a foreign foe and while constituting the elements of a greater force to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implements of war in a state to be brought into activity in the event of war; the latter retained within the limits proper in a state of peace might a in maintaining the neutrality of the United States with dignity in the wars of other powers and in saving the property of their citizens from spoliation. In time of war with the enlargement of which the great al resources of the country render it susceptible and which should be duly fostered in time of peace it would contribute essentially both as an auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance to diminish the calamities of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination. But it ought always to be held prominently in  that the safety of these States and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an eminent degree on the militia. Invasions may be made too formable to be resisted by any land and al force which it would comport either with the principles of our Government or the circumstances of the United States to maintain. In such cases recourse must be had to the great body of the people and in a manner to produce the best effect. It is of the highest importance therefore that they be so organized and trained as to be prepared for any emergency. The arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the Government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country. If formed on equal and just principles it can not be oppressive. It is the crisis which makes the pressure and not the laws which prove a remedy for it. This arrangement should be formed too in time of peace to be the better prepared for war. With such an organization of such a people the United States have nothing to dread from foreign invasion. At its approach an overwhelming force of gallant men might always be put in motion. Other interests of high importance will claim attention among which the improvement of our country by roads and canals proceeding always with a constitutional sanction holds a distinguished place. By thus facilitating the intercourse between the States we shall add much to the convenience and comfort of our fellowcitizens much to the ornament of the country and what is of greater importance we shall shorten distances and by making each part more accessible to and dependent on the other we shall bind the Union more closely together. Nature has done so much for us by intersecting the country with so many great rivers bays and lakes approaching from distant points so near to each other that the inducement to complete the work seems to be peculiarly strong. A more interesting spectacle was perhaps never seen than is exhibited within the limits of the United Statesa territory so vast and advantageously situated containing objects so grand so useful so happily connected in all their parts! Our manufacturers will likewise require the systematic and fostering care of the Government. Possessing as we do all the raw materials the fruit of our own soil and industry we ought not to depend in the degree we have done on supplies from other countries. While we are thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge us into the most serious difficulties. It is important too that the capital which nourishes our manufacturers should be domestic as its influence in that case instead of exhausting as it may do in foreign hands would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry. Equally important is it to prove at home a market for our raw materials as by extending the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualties incent to foreign markets. With the Indian tribes it is our duty to cultivate friendly relations and to act with kindness and liberality in all our transactions. Equally proper is it to persevere in our efforts to extend to them the advantages of civilization. The great amount of our revenue and the flourishing state of the Treasury are a full proof of the competency of the national resources for any emergency as they are of the willingness of our fellowcitizens to bear the burdens which the public necessities require. The vast amount of vacant lands the value of which daily augments forms an additional resource of great extent and duration. These resources beses accomplishing every other necessary purpose put it completely in the power of the United States to discharge the national debt at an early period. Peace is the best time for improvement and preparation of every kind; it is in peace that our commerce flourishes most that taxes are most easily pa and that the revenue is most productive. The Executive is charged officially in the Departments under it with the disbursement of the public money and is responsible for the faithful application of it to the purposes for which it is raised. The Legislature is the watchful guardian over the public purse. It is its duty to see that the disbursement has been honestly made. To meet the requisite responsibility every facility should be afforded to the Executive to enable it to bring the public agents intrusted with the public money strictly and promptly to account. Nothing should be presumed against them; but if with the requisite facilities the public money is suffered to lie long and uselessly in their hands they will not be the only defaulters nor will the demoralizing effect be confined to them. It will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the Administration which will be felt by the whole community. I shall do all I can to secure economy and felity in this important branch of the Administration and I doubt not that the Legislature will perform its duty with equal zeal. A thorough examination should be regularly made and I will promote it. It is particularly gratifying to me to enter on the discharge of these duties at a time when the United States are blessed with peace. It is a state most consistent with their prosperity and happiness. It will be my sincere desire to preserve it so far as depends on the Executive on just principles with all nations claiming nothing unreasonable of any and rendering to each what is its due. Equally gratifying is it to witness the increased harmony of opinion which pervades our Union. Discord does not belong to our system. Union is recommended as well by the free and benign principles of our Government extending its blessings to every inual as by the other eminent advantages attending it. The American people have encountered together great dangers and sustained severe trials with success. They constitute one great family with a common interest. Experience has enlightened us on some questions of essential importance to the country. The progress has been slow dictated by a just reflection and a faithful regard to every interest connected with it. To promote this harmony in accord with the principles of our republican Government and in a manner to give them the most complete effect and to advance in all other respects the best interests of our Union will be the object of my constant and zealous exertions. Never d a government commence under auspices so favorable nor ever was success so complete. If we look to the history of other nations ancient or modern we find no example of a growth so rap so gigantic of a people so prosperous and happy. In contemplating what we have still to perform the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he reflects how near our Government has approached to perfection; that in respect to it we have no essential improvement to make; that the great object is to preserve it in the essential principles and features which characterize it and that is to be done by preserving the virtue and enlightening the minds of the people; and as a security against foreign dangers to adopt such arrangements as are indispensable to the support of our independence our rights and liberties. If we persevere in the career in which we have advanced so far and in the path already traced we can not fail under the favor of a gracious Provence to attain the high destiny which seems to await us. In the Administrations of the illustrious men who have preceded me in this high station with some of whom I have been connected by the closest ties from early life examples are presented which will always be found highly instructive and useful to their successors. From these I shall endeavor to derive all the advantages which they may afford. Of my immediate predecessor under whom so important a portion of this great and successful experiment has been made I shall be pardoned for expressing my earnest wishes that he may long enjoy in his retirement the affections of a grateful country the best reward of exalted talents and the most faithful and meritorious service. Relying on the a to be derived from the other departments of the Government I enter on the trust to which I have been called by the suffrages of my fellowcitizens with my fervent prayers to the Almighty that will be graciously pleased to continue to us that protection which has already so conspicuously displayed in our favor. 
<emTo the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:em I submit to the conseration of Congress a letter from the agent of the United States with the Creek Indians who invoke the protection of the Government of the United States in defense of the rights and territory secured to that nation by the treaty concluded at Washington and ratified on the part of the United States on the 22d of April last. The complaint set forth in this letter that surveyors from Georgia have been employed in surveying lands within the Indian Territory as secured by that treaty is authenticated by the information inofficially received from other quarters and there is reason to believe that one or more of the surveyors have been arrested in their progress by the Indians. Their forbearance and reliance upon the good faith of the United States will it is hoped avert scenes of violence and blood which there is otherwise too much cause to apprehend will result from these proceedings. By the fifth section of the act of Congress of the 30th of March 1802 to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve peace on the frontiers it is proved that if any citizen of or other person resent in the United States shall make a settlement on any lands belonging or secured or granted by treaty with the United States to any Indian tribe or shall survey or attempt to survey such lands or designate any of the boundaries by marking trees or otherwise such offender shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $1000 and suffer imprisonment not exceeding twelve months. By the sixteenth and seventeenth sections of the same statute two distinct processes are prescribed by either or both of which the above enactment may be carried into execution. By the first it is declared to be lawful for the military force of the United States to apprehend every person found in the Indian country over and beyond the boundary line between the United States and the Indian tribes in violation of any of the provisions or regulations of the act and immediately to convey them in the nearest convenient and safe route to the civil authority of the United States in some of the three next adjoining States or districts to be proceeded against in due course of law. By the second it is directed that if any person charged with the violation of any of the provisions or regulations of the act shall be found within any of the United States or either of their territorial districts such offender may be there apprehended and brought to trial in the same manner as if such crime or offense had been committed within such State or district; and that it shall be the duty of the military force of the United States when called upon by the civil magistrate or any proper officer or other person duly authorized for that purpose and having a lawful warrant to a and assist such magistrate officer or other person so authorized in arresting such offender and committing him to safe custody for trial according to law. The first of these processes is adapted to the arrest of the trespasser upon Indian territories on the spot and in the act of committing the offense; but as it applies the action of the Government of the United States to places where the civil process of the law has no authorized course it is committed entirely to the s of the military force to arrest the person of the offender and after bringing him within the reach of the jurisdiction of the courts there to deliver him into custody for trial. The second makes the violator of the law amenable only after his offense has been consummated and when he has returned within the civil jurisdiction of the Union. This process in the first instance is merely of a civil character but may in like manner be enforced by calling in if necessary the a of the military force. Entertaining no doubt that in the present case the resort to either of these modes of process or to both was within the discretion of the Executive authority and penetrated with the duty of maintaining the rights of the Indians as secured both by the treaty and the law I concluded after full deliberation to have recourse on this occasion in the first instance only to the civil process. Instructions have accordingly been given by the Secretary of War to the attorney and marshal of the United States in the district of Georgia to commence prosecutions against the surveyors complained of as having violated the law while orders have at the same time been forwarded to the agent of the United States at once to assure the Indians that their rights founded upon the treaty and the law are recognized by this Government and will be faithfully protected and earnestly to exhort them by the forbearance of every act of hostility on their part to preserve unimpaired that right to protection secured to them by the sacred pledge of the good faith of this nation. Copies of these instructions and orders are herewith transmitted to Congress. In abstaining at this stage of the proceedings from the application of any military force I have been governed by conserations which will I trust meet the concurrence of the Legislature. Among them one of paramount importance has been that these surveys have been attempted and partly effected under color of legal authority from the State of Georgia; that the surveyors are therefore not to be ed in the light of inual and solitary transgressors but as the agents of a sovereign State acting in obedience to authority which they believed to be binding upon them. Intimations had been given that should they meet with interruption they would at all hazards be sustained by the military force of the State in which event if the military force of the Union should have been employed to enforce its violated law a conflict must have ensued which would itself have inflicted a wound upon the Union and have presented the aspect of one of these confederated States at war with the rest. Anxious above all to avert this state of things yet at the same time impressed with the deepest conviction of my own duty to take care that the laws shall be executed and the faith of the nation preserved I have used of the means intrusted to the Executive for that purpose only those which without resorting to military force may vindicate the sanctity of the law by the ordinary agency of the judicial tribunals. It ought not however to be disguised that the act of the legislature of Georgia under the construction given to it by the governor of that State and the surveys made or attempted by his authority beyond the boundary secured by the treaty of Washington of April last to the Creek Indians are in direct violation of the supreme law of this land set forth in a treaty which has received all the sanctions proved by the Constitution which we have been sworn to support and maintain. Happily distributed as the sovereign powers of the people of this Union have been between their General and State Governments their history has already too often presented collisions between these ed authorities with regard to the extent of their respective powers. No instance however has hitherto occurred in which this collision has been urged into a conflict of actual force. No other case is known to have happened in which the application of military force by the Government of the Union has been prescribed for the enforcement of a law the violation of which has within any single State been prescribed by a legislative act of the State. In the present instance it is my duty to say that if the legislative and executive authorities of the State of Georgia should persevere in acts of encroachment upon the territories secured by a solemn treaty to the Indians and the laws of the Union remain unaltered a superadded obligation even higher than that of human authority will compel the Executive of the United States to enforce the laws and fulfill the duties of the nation by all the force committed for that purpose to his charge. That the arm of military force will be resorted to only in the event of the failure of all other expedients proved by the laws a pledge has been given by the forbearance to employ it at this time. It is submitted to the wisdom of Congress to determine whether any further act of legislation may be necessary or expedient to meet the emergency which these transactions may produce.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:The progress of our affairs since the last session has been such as may justly be claimed and expected under a Government deriving all its powers from an enlightened people and under laws formed by their representatives on great conseration for the sole purpose of promoting the welfare and happiness of their constituents. In the execution of those laws and of the powers vested by the Constitution in the Executive unremitted attention has been pa to the great objects to which they extend. In the concerns which are exclusively internal there is good cause to be satisfied with the result. The laws have had their due operation and effect. In those relating to foreign powers I am happy to state that peace and amity are preserved with all by a strict observance on both ses of the rights of each. In matters touching our commercial intercourse where a difference of opinion has existed as to the conditions on which it should be placed each party has pursued its own policy without giving just cause of offense to the other. In this annual communication especially when it is addressed to a new Congress the whole scope of our political concerns naturally comes into  that errors if such have been committed may be corrected; that defects which have become manifest may be remedied; and on the other hand that measures which were adopted on due deliberation and which experience has shewn are just in themselves and essential to the public welfare should be persevered in and supported. In performing this necessary and very important duty I shall endeavor to place before you on its merits every subject that is thought to be entitled to your particular attention in as distinct and clear a light as I may be able. By an act of [18150303] so much of the several acts as imposed higher duties on the tonnage of foreign vessels and on the manufactures and productions of foreign nations when imported into the United States in foreign vessels than when imported in vessels of the United States were repealed so far as respected the manufactures and productions of the nation to which such vessels belonged on the condition that the repeal should take effect only in favor of any foreign nation when the Executive should be satisfied that such discriminating duties to the disadvantage of the United States had likewise been repealed by such nation. By this act a proposition was made to all nations to place our commerce with each on a basis which it was presumed would be acceptable to all. Every nation was allowed to bring its manufactures and productions into our ports and to take the manufactures and productions of the United States back to their ports in their own vessels on the same conditions that they might be transported in vessels of the United States and in return it was required that a like accommodation should be granted to the vessels of the United States in the ports of other powers. The articles to be admitted or prohibited on either se formed no part of the proposed arrangement. Each party would retain the right to admit or prohibit such articles from the other as it thought proper and on its own conditions. When the nature of the commerce between the United States and every other country was taken into  it was thought that this proposition would be consered fair and even liberal by every power. The exports of the United States consist generally of articles of the 1st necessity and of rude materials in demand for foreign manufactories of great bulk requiring for their transportation many vessels the return for which in the manufactures and productions of any foreign country even when disposed of there to advantage may be brought in a single vessel. This observation is the more especially applicable to those countries from which manufactures alone are imported but it applies in great extent to the European dominions of every European power and in a certain extent to all the colonies of those powers. By placing then the igation precisely on the same ground in the transportation of exports and imports between the United States and other countries it was presumed that all was offered which could be desired. It seemed to be the only proposition which could be devised which would retain even the semblance of equality in our favor. Many conserations of great weight gave us a right to expect that this commerce should be extended to the colonies as well as to the European dominions of other powers. With the latter especially with countries exclusively manufacturing the advantage was manifestly on their se. An indemnity for that loss was expected from a trade with the colonies and with the greater reason as it was known that the supplies which the colonies derived from us were of the highest importance to them their labor being bestowed with so much greater profit in the culture of other articles; and because likewise the articles of which those supplies consisted forming so large a proportion of the exports of the United States were never admitted into any of the ports of Europe except in cases of great emergency to avert a serious calamity. When no article is admitted which is not required to supply the wants of the party admitting it and admitted then not in favor of any particular country to the disadvantage of others but on conditions equally applicable to all it seems just that the articles thus admitted and invited should be carried thither in the vessels of the country affording such supply and that the reciprocity should be found in a corresponding accommodation on the other se. By allowing each party to participate in the transportation of such supplies on the payment of equal tonnage a strong proof was afforded of an accommodating spirit. To abandon to it the transportation of the whole would be a sacrifice which ought not to be expected. The demand in the present instance would be the more unreasonable in conseration of the great inequality existing in the trade with the parent country. Such was the basis of our system as established by the act of 1815 and such its true character. In the year in which this act was passed a treaty was concluded with Great Britain in strict conformity with its principles in regard to her European dominions. to her colonies however in the West Indies and on this continent it was not extended the British Government claiming the exclusive supply of those colonies and from our own ports and of the productions of the colonies in return in her own vessels. To this claim the United States could not assent and in consequence each party suspended the intercourse in the vessels of the other by a prohibition which still exists. The same conditions were offered to France but not accepted. Her Government has demanded other conditions more favorable to her igation and which should also give extraordinary encouragement to her manufactures and productions in ports of the United States. To these it was thought improper to accede and in consequence the restrictive regulations which had been adopted on her part being countervailed on the part of the United States the direct commerce between the 2 countries in the vessels of each party has been in great measure suspended. It is much to be regretted that although a negotiation has been long pending such is the ersity of s entertained on the various points which have been brought into discussion that there does not appear to be any reasonable prospect of its early conclusion. It is my duty to state as a cause of very great regret that very serious differences have occurred in this negotiation respecting the construction of the 8th article of the treaty of 1803 by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States and likewise respecting the seizure of the Apollo in 1820 for a violation of our revenue laws. The claim of the Government of France has excited not less surprise than concern because there does not appear to be a just foundation for it in either instance. By the 8th article of the treaty referred to it is stipulated that after the expiration of 12 years during which time it was proved by the 7th or preceding article that the vessels of France and Spain should be admitted into the ports of the ceded territory without paying higher duties on merchandise or tonnage on the vessels than such as were pa by citizens of the United States the ships of France should forever afterwards be placed on the footing of the most favored nation. By the obvious construction of this article it is presumed that it was intended that no favor should be granted to any power in those ports to which France should not be forthwith entitled nor should any accommodation be allowed to another power on conditions to which she would not also be entitled on the same conditions. Under this construction no favor or accommodation could be granted to any power to the prejudice of France. By allowing the equivalent allowed by those powers she would always stand in those ports on the footing of the most favored nation. But if this article should be so construed as that France should enjoy of right and without paying the equivalent all the advantages of such conditions as might be allowed to other powers in return for important concessions made by them then the whole character of the stipulations would be changed. She would not be placed on the footing of the most favored nation but on a footing held by no other nation. She would enjoy all advantages allowed to them in conseration of like advantages allowed to us free from every and any condition whatever. As little cause has the Government of France to complain of the seizure of the Apollo and the removal of other vessels from the waters of the St. Marys. It will not be denied that every nation has a right to regulate its commercial system as it thinks fit and to enforce the collection of its revenue proved it be done without an invasion of the rights of other powers. The violation of its revenue laws is an offense which all nations punish the punishment of which gives no just cause of complaint to the power to which the offenders belong proved it be extended to all equally. In this case every circumstance which occurred indicated a fixed purpose to violate our revenue laws. Had the party intended to have pursued a fair trade he would have entered the port of some other power landed his goods at the custom house according to law and reshipped and sent them in the vessel of such power or of some other power which might lawfully bring them free from such duties to a port of the United States. But the conduct of the party in this case was altogether different. entered the river St. Marys the boundary line between the United States and Flora and took his position on the Spanish se on which in the whole extent of the river there was no town no port or custom house and scarcely any settlement. His purpose therefore was not to sell his goods to the inhabitants of Flora but to citizens of the United States in exchange for their productions which could not be done without a direct and palpable breach of our laws. It is known that a regular systematic plan had been formed by certain persons for the violation of our revenue system which made it the more necessary to check the proceeding in its commencement. That the unsettled bank of a river so remote from the Spanish garrisons and population could give no protection to any party in such a practice is believed to be in strict accord with the law of nations. It would not have comported with a friendly policy in Spain herself to have established a custom house there since it could have subserved no other purpose than to elude our revenue law. But the Government of Spain d not adopt that measure. On the contrary it is understood that the CaptainGeneral of Cuba to whom an application to that effect was made by these adventurers had not acceded to it. The condition of those Provinces for many years before they were ceded to the United States need not now be dwelt on. Inhabited by different tribes of Indians and an inroad for every kind of adventurer the jurisdiction of Spain may be sa to have been almost exclusively confined to her garrisons. It certainly could not extend to places where she had no authority. The rules therefore applicable to settled countries governed by laws could not be deemed so to the deserts of Flora and to the occurrences there. It merits attention also that the territory had been ceded to the United States by a treaty the ratification of which had not been refused and which has since been performed. Under any circumstances therefore Spain became less responsible for such acts committed there and the United States more at liberty to exercise authority to prevent so great a mischief. The conduct of this Government has in every instance been conciliatory and friendly to France. The construction of our revenue law in its application to the cases which have formed the ground of such serious complaint on her part and the order to the collector of St. Marys in accord with it were given two years before these cases occurred and in reference to a breach which was attempted by the subjects of another power. The application therefore to the cases in question was inevitable. As soon as the treaty by which these Provinces were ceded to the United States was ratified and all danger of further breach of our revenue laws ceased an order was given for the release of the vessel which had been seized and for the dismission of the libel which had been instituted against her. The principles of this system of reciprocity founded on the law of [18150303] have been since carried into effect with the Kingdoms of the Netherlands Sweden Prussia and with Hamburg Lubeck and Oldenburg with a provision made by subsequent laws in regard to the Netherlands Prussia Hamburg and Bremen that such produce and manufactures as could only be or most usually were 1st shipped from the ports of those countries the same being imported in vessels wholly belonging to their subjects should be consered and admitted as their own manufactures and productions. The Government of Norway has by an ordinance opened the ports of that part of the dominions of the King of Sweden to the vessels of the United States upon the payment of no other or higher duties than are pa by Norwegian vessels from whatever place arriving and with whatever articles laden. They have requested the reciprocal allowance for the vessels of Norway in the ports of the United States. As this privilege is not within the scope of the act of [18150303] and can only be granted by Congress and as it may involve the commercial relations of the United States with other nations the subject is submitted to the wisdom of Congress. I have presented thus fully to your  our commercial relations with other powers that seeing them in detail with each power and knowing the basis on which they rest Congress may in its wisdom dece whether any change ought to be made and if any in what respect. If this basis is unjust or unreasonable surely it ought to be abandoned; but if it be just and reasonable and any change in it will make concessions subversive of equality and tending in its consequences to sap the foundations of our prosperity then the reasons are equally strong for adhering to the ground already taken and supporting it by such further regulations as may appear to be proper should any additional support be found necessary. The question concerning the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent has been by a joint act of the representatives of the United States and of Great Britain at the Court of St. Petersburg submitted to the decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia. The result of that submission has not yet been received. The commissioners under the 5th article of that treaty not having been able to agree upon their decision their reports to the two Governments according to the provisions of the treaty may be expected at an early day. With Spain the treaty of [18190222] has been partly carried into execution. Possession of E and W FL has been given to the United States but the officers charged with that service by an order from His Catholic Majesty delivered by his minister to the Sec of State and transmitted by a special agent to the CaptainGeneral of Cuba to whom it was directed and in whom the Government of those Provinces was vested have not only omitted in contravention of the order of their Sovereign the performance of the express stipulation to deliver over the archives and documents relating to the property and sovereignty of those Provinces all of which it was expected would have been delivered either before or when the troops were withdrawn but defeated since every effort of the United States to obtain them especially those of the greatest importance. This omission has given rise to several incents of a painful nature the character of which will be fully disclosed by the documents which will be hereafter communicated. In every other circumstance of the law of the 3rd of March last for carrying into effect that treaty has been duly attended to. For the execution of that part which preserved in force for the Government of the inhabitants for the term specified all the civil military and judicial powers exercised by the existing Government of those Provinces an adequate # of officers as was presumed were appointed and ordered to their respective stations. Both Provinces were formed into 1 Territory and a governor appointed for it; but in conseration of the preexisting ision and of the distance and difficulty of communication between Pensacola the resence of the governor of West Flora and St. Augustine that of the governor of East Flora at which places the inconserable population of each Province was principally collected two secretaries were appointed the one to rese at Pensacola and the other at St. Augustine. Due attention was likewise pa to the execution of the laws of the United States relating to the revenue and the slave trade which were extended to these Provinces. The whole Territory was ed into three collection districts that part lying between the river St. Marys and Cape Flora forming one that from the Cape to the Apalachicola another and that from the Apalachicola to the Perdo the third. To these districts the usual number of revenue officers were appointed; and to secure the due operation of these laws one judge and a district attorney were appointed to rese at Pensacola and likewise one judge and a district attorney to rese at St. Augustine with a specified boundary between them; and one marshal for the whole with authority to appoint a deputy. In carrying this law into effect and especially that part relating to the powers of the existing Government of those Provinces it was thought important in conseration of the short term for which it was to operate and the radical change which would be made at the approaching session of Congress to avo expense to make no appointment which should not be absolutely necessary to give effect to those powers to withdraw none of our citizens from their pursuits whereby to subject the Government to claims which could not be gratified and the parties to losses which it would be painful to witness. It has been seen with much concern that in the performance of these duties a collision arose between the governor of the Territory and the judge appointed for the western district. It was presumed that the law under which this transitory Government was organized and the commissions which were granted to the officers who were appointed to execute each branch of the system and to which the commissions were adapted would have been understood in the same sense by them in which they were understood by the Executive. Much allowance is due to officers employed in each branch of this system and the more so as there is good cause to believe that each acted under the conviction that he possessed the power which he undertook to exercise. Of the officer holding the principal station I think it proper to observe that he accepted it with reluctance in compliance with the invitation given him and from a high sense of duty to his country being willing to contribute to the consummation of an event which would insure complete protection to an important part of our Union which had suffered much from incursion and invasion and to the defense of which his very gallant and patriotic services had been so signally and usefully devoted. From the intrinsic difficulty of executing laws deriving their origin from different sources and so essentially different in many important circumstances the advantage and indeed the necessity of establishing as soon as practicable a wellorganized Government over that Territory on the principles of our system is apparent. This subject is therefore recommended to the early conseration of Congress. In compliance with an injunction of the law of the 3rd of March last three commissioners have also been appointed and a board organized for carrying into effect the 11th article of the treaty above recited making provision for the payment of such of our citizens as have wellfounded claims on Spain of the character specified by that treaty. This board has entered on its duties and made some progress therein. The commissioner and surveyor of His Catholic Majesty proved for by the 4th article of the treaty have not yet arrived in the United States but are soon expected. As soon as they do arrive corresponding appointments will be made and every facility be afforded for the due execution of this service. The Government of His Most Faithful Majesty since the termination of the last session of Congress has been removed from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon where a revolution similar to that which had occurred in the neighboring Kingdom of Spain had in like manner been sanctioned by the accepted and pledged faith of the reigning monarch. The diplomatic intercourse between the United States and the Portuguese dominions interrupted by this important event has not yet been resumed but the change of internal administration having already materially affected the commercial intercourse of the United States with the Portuguese dominions the renewal of the public missions between the two countries appears to be desirable at an early day. It is understood that the colonies in South America have had great success during the present year in the struggle for their independence. The new Government of Colombia has extended its territories and conserably augmented its strength and at Buenos Ayres where civil dissensions had for some time before prevailed greater harmony and better order appear to have been established. Equal success has attended their efforts in the Provinces on the Pacific. It has long been manifest that it would be impossible for Spain to reduce these colonies by force and equally so that no conditions short of their independence would be satisfactory to them. It may therefore be presumed and it is earnestly hoped that the Government of Spain gued by enlightened and liberal councils will find it to comport with its interests and due to its magnanimity to terminate this exhausting controversy on that basis. To promote this result by friendly counsel with the Government of Spain will be the object of the Government of the United States. In conducting the fiscal operations of the year it has been found necessary to carry into full effect the act of the last session of Congress authorizing a loan of $5M. This sum has been raised at an average premium of $5.59 per centum upon stock bearing an interest at the rate of 5% per annum redeemable at the option of the Government after [18350101]. There has been issued under the provisions of this act $4735296.30 of 5% stock and there has been or will be redeemed during the year $3197030.71 of Louisiana 6% deferred stock and Mississippi stock. There has therefore been an actual increase of the public debt contracted during the year of $1538266.69. The receipts into the Treasury from the first of January to the 30th of September last have amounted to $16219197.70 which with the balance of $1198461.21 in the Treasury on the former day make the aggregate sum of $17417658.91. The payments from the Treasury during the same period have amounted to $15655288.47 leaving in the Treasury on the lastmentioned day the sum of $1762370.44. It is estimated that the receipts of the 4th quarter of the year will exceed the demands which will be made on the Treasury during the same period and that the amount in the Treasury on the 30th of September last will be increased on the first day of January next. At the close of the last session it was anticipated that the progressive diminution of the public revenue in 1819 and 1820 which had been the result of the langu state of our foreign commerce in those years had in the latter year reached its extreme point of depression. It has however been ascertained that that point was reached only at the termination of the first quarter of the present year. From that time until the 30th of September last the duties secured have exceeded those of the corresponding quarters of the last year $1.172M whilst the amount of debentures issued during the three first quarters of this year is $952000 less than that of the same quarters of the last year. There are just grounds to believe that the improvement which has occurred in the revenue during the lastmentioned period will not only be maintained but that it will progressively increase through the next and several succeeding years so as to realize the results which were presented upon that subject by the official reports of the Treasury at the commencement of the last session of Congress. Under the influence of the most unfavorable circumstances the revenue for the next and subsequent years to the year 1825 will exceed the demands at present authorized by law. It may fairly be presumed that under the protection given to domestic manufactures by the existing laws we shall become at no distant period a manufacturing country on an extensive scale. Possessing as we do the raw materials in such vast amount with a capacity to augment them to an indefinite extent; raising within the country aliment of every kind to an amount far exceeding the demand for home consumption even in the most unfavorable years and to be obtained always at a very moderate price; skilled also as our people are in the mechanic arts and in every improvement calculated to lessen the demand for and the price of labor it is manifest that their success in every branch of domestic industry may and will be carried under the encouragement given by the present duties to an extent to meet any demand which under a fair competition may be made upon it. A conserable increase of domestic manufactures by diminishing the importation of foreign will probably tend to lessen the amount of the public revenue. As however a large proportion of the revenue which is derived from duties is raised from other articles than manufactures the demand for which will increase with our population it is believed that a fund will still be raised from that source adequate to the greater part of the public expenditures especially as those expenditures should we continue to be blessed with peace will be diminished by the completion of the fortifications dock yards and other public works by the augmentation of the Navy to the point to which it is proposed to carry it and by the payment of the public debt including pensions for military services. It can not be doubted that the more complete our internal resources and the less dependent we are on foreign powers for every national as well as domestic purpose the greater and more stable will be the public felicity. By the increase of domestic manufactures will the demand for the rude materials at home be increased and thus will the dependence of the several parts of our Union on each other and the strength of the Union itself be proportionably augmented. In this process which is very desirable and inevitable under the existing duties the resources which obviously present themselves to supply a deficiency in the revenue should it occur are the interests which may derive the principal benefit from the change. If domestic manufactures are raised by duties on foreign the deficiency in the fund necessary for public purposes should be supplied by duties on the former. At the last session it seemed doubtful whether the revenue derived from the present sources would be adequate to all the great purposes of our Union including the construction of our fortifications the augmentation of the Navy and the protection of our commerce against the dangers to which it is exposed. had the deficiency been such as to subject us to the necessity either to abandon those measures of defense or to resort to the other means for adequate funds the course presented to the adoption of a virtuous and enlightened people appeared to be a plain one. It must be gratifying to all to know that this necessity does not exist. Nothing however in contemplation of such important objects which can be easily proved for should be left to hazard. It is thought that the revenue may receive an augmentation from the existing sources and in a manner to a our manufactures without hastening prematurely the result which has been suggested. It is believed that a moderate additional duty on certain articles would have that effect without being liable to any serious objection. The examination of the whole coast for the construction of permanent fortifications from St. Croix to the Sabine with the exception of part of the territory lately acquired will be completed in the present year as will be the survey of the Mississippi under the resolution of the House of Representatives from the mouth of the Ohio to the ocean and likewise of the Ohio from Louisville to the Mississippi. A progress corresponding with the sums appropriated has also been made in the construction of these fortifications at the ports designated. As they will form a system of defense for the whole maritime frontier and in consequence for the interior and are to last for ages the greatest care has been taken to fix the position of each work and to form it on such a scale as will be adequate to the purpose intended by it. All the inlets and assailable parts of our Union have been minutely examined and positions taken with a  to the best effect observing in every instance a just regard for economy. Doubts however being entertained as to the propriety of the position and extent of the work at Dauphine Island further progress in it was suspended soon after the last session of Congress and an order given to the Board of Engineers and Naval Commissioners to make a further and more minute examination of it in both respects and to report the result without delay. Due progress has been made in the construction of vessels of war according to the law proving for the gradual augmentation of the Navy and to the extent of existing appropriations. The vessels authorized by the act of 1820 have all been completed and are now in actual service. None of the larger ships have been or will be launched for the present the object being to protect all which may not be required for immediate service from decay by suitable buildings erected over them. A squadron has been maintained as heretofore in the Mediterranean by means whereof peace has been preserved with the Barbary Powers. This squadron has been reduced the present year to as small a force as is compatible with the fulfillment of the object intended by it. From past experience and the best information respecting the s of those powers it is distinctly understood that should our squadron be withdrawn they would soon recommence their hostilities and depredations upon our commerce. Their fortifications have lately been rebuilt and their maritime force increased. It has also been found necessary to maintain a al force on the Pacific for the protection of the very important interests of our citizens engaged in commerce and the fisheries in that sea. Vessels have likewise been employed in cruising along the Atlantic coast in the Gulf of Mexico on the coast of Africa and in the neighboring seas. In the latter many piracies have been committed on our commerce and so extensive was becoming the range of those unprincipled adventurers that there was cause to apprehend without a timely and decisive effort to suppress them the worst consequences would ensue. Fortunately a conserable check has been given to that spirit by our cruisers who have succeeded in capturing and destr
ying several of their vessels. Nevertheless it is consered an object of high importance to continue these cruises until the practice is entirely suppressed. Like success has attended our efforts to suppress the slave trade. Under the flag of the United States and the sanction of their papers the trade may be consered as entire suppressed and if any of our citizens are engaged in it under the flags and papers of other powers it is only from a respect of those powers that these offenders are not seized and brought home to receive the punishment which the laws inflict. If every other power should adopt the same policy and pursue the same vigorous means for carrying it into effect the trade could no longer exist. Deeply impressed with the blessings which we enjoy and of which we have such manifold proofs my mind is irresistibly drawn to that Almighty Being the great source from whence they proceed and to whom our most grateful acknowledgments are due. 
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:A revolution of the seasons has nearly been completed since the representatives of the people and States of this Union were last assembled at this place to deliberate and to act upon the common important interests of their constituents. In that interval the never slumbering eye of a wise and beneficent Provence has continued its guardian care over the welfare of our beloved country; the blessing of health has continued generally to prevail throughout the land; the blessing of peace with our brethren of the human race has been enjoyed without interruption; internal quiet has left our fellow citizens in the full enjoyment of all their rights and in the free exercise of all their faculties to pursue the impulse of their nature and the obligation of their duty in the improvement of their own condition; the productions of the soil the exchanges of commerce the vivifying labors of human industry have combined to mingle in our cup a portion of enjoyment as large and liberal as the indulgence of Heaven has perhaps ever granted to the imperfect state of man upon earth; and as the purest of human felicity consists in its participation with others it is no small addition to the sum of our national happiness at this time that peace and prosperity prevail to a degree seldom experienced over the whole habitable globe presenting though as yet with painful exceptions a foretaste of that blessed period of promise when the lion shall lie down with the lamb and wars shall be no more. To preserve to improve and to perpetuate the sources and to direct in their most effective channels the streams which contribute to the public weal is the purpose for which Government was instituted. Objects of deep importance to the welfare of the Union are constantly recurring to demand the attention of the Federal Legislature and they call with accumulated interest at the first meeting of the two Houses after their periodical renovation. To present to their conseration from time to time subjects in which the interests of the nation are most deeply involved and for the regulation of which the legislative will is alone competent is a duty prescribed by the Constitution to the performance of which the first meeting of the new Congress is a period eminently appropriate and which it is now my purpose to discharge. Our relations of friendship with the other nations of the earth political and commercial have been preserved unimpaired and the opportunities to improve them have been cultivated with anxious and unremitting attention. A negotiation upon subjects of high and delicate interest with the Government of Great Britain has terminated in the adjustment of some of the questions at issue upon satisfactory terms and the postponement of others for future discussion and agreement. The purposes of the convention concluded at St. Petersburg on 18220712 under the mediation of the late Emperor Alexander have been carried into effect by a subsequent convention concluded at London on 18261113 the ratifications of which were exchanged at that place on 18270206. A copy of the proclamations issued on 18270319 publishing this convention is herewith communicated to Congress. The sum of $1204960 therein stipulated to be pa to the claimants of indemnity under the first article of the treaty of Ghent has been duly received and the commission instituted comformably to the act of Congress of 18270302 for the distribution of the indemnity of the persons entitled to receive it are now in session and approaching the consummation of their labors. This final disposal of one of the most painful topics of collision between the United States and Great Britain not only affords an occasion of gratulation to ourselves but has had the happiest effect in promoting a friendly disposition and in softening asperities upon other objects of discussion; nor ought it to pass without the tribute of a frank and cordial acknowledgment of the magnanimity with which an honorable nation by the reparation of their own wrongs achieves a triumph more glorious than any field of blood can ever bestow. The conventions of 18150703 and of 18181020 will expire by their own limitation on 18281020. These have regulated the direct commercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain upon terms of the most perfect reciprocity; and they effected a temporary compromise of the respective rights and claims to territory westward of the Rocky Mountains. These arrangements have been continued for an indefinite period of time after the expiration of the above mentioned conventions leaving each party the liberty of terminating them by giving twelve months' notice to the other. The radical principle of all commercial intercourse between independent nations is the mutual interest of both parties. It is the vital spirit of trade itself; nor can it be reconciled to the nature of man or to the primary laws of human society that any traffic should long be willingly pursued of which all the advantages are on one se and all the burdens on the other. Treaties of commerce have been found by experience to be among the most effective instruments for promoting peace and harmony between nations whose interests exclusively consered on either se are brought into frequent collisions by competition. In framing such treaties it is the duty of each party not simply to urge with unyielding pertinacity that which suits its own interest but to concede liberally to that which is adapted to the interest of the other. To accomplish this little more is generally required than a simple observance of the rule of reciprocity and were it possible for the states men of 1 nation by stratagem and management to obtain from the weakness or ignorance of another an overreaching treaty such a compact would prove an incentive to war rather than a bond of peace. Our conventions with Great Britain are founded upon the principles of reciprocity. The commercial intercourse between the two countries is greater in magnitude and amount than between any two other nations on the globe. It is for all purposes of benefit or advantage to both as precious and in all probability far more extensive than if the parties were still constituent parts of one and the same nation. Treaties between such States regulating the intercourse of peace between them and adjusting interests of such transcendent importance to both which have been found in a long experience of years mutually advantageous should not be lightly cancelled or discontinued. Two conventions for continuing in force those above mentioned have been concluded between the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on 18270806 and will be forthwith la before the Senate for the exercise of their constitutional authority concerning them. In the execution of the treaties of peace of 178211 and 178309 between the United States and Great Britain and which terminated the war of our independence a line of boundary was drawn as the demarcation of territory between the two countries extending over nearly 20 degrees of latitude and ranging over seas lakes and mountains then very imperfectly explored and scarcely opened to the geographical knowledge of the age. In the progress of discovery and settlement by both parties since that time several questions of boundary between their respective territories have arisen which have been found of exceedingly difficult adjustment. At the close of the last war with Great Britain four of these questions pressed themselves upon the conseration of the negotiators of the treaty of Ghent but without the means of concluding a definitive arrangement concerning them. They were referred to three separate commissions consisting of two commissioners one appointed by each party to examine and dece upon their respective claims. In the event of a disagreement between the commissioners one appointed by each party to examine and dece upon their respective claims. In the event of a disagreement between the commissioners it was proved that they should make reports to their several Governments and that the reports should finally be referred to the decision of a sovereign the common friend of both. Of these commissions two have already terminated their sessions and investigations one by entire and the other by partial agreement. The commissioners of the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent have finally disagreed and made their conflicting reports to their own Governments. But from these reports a great difficulty has occurred in making up a question to be deced by the arbitrator. This purpose has however been effected by a 4th convention concluded at London by the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on 18270929. It will be submitted together with the others to the conseration of the Senate. While these questions have been pending incents have occurred of conflicting pretensions and of dangerous character upon the territory itself in dispute between the two nations. By a common understanding between the Governments it was agreed that no exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by either party while the negotiation was pending should change the state of the question of right to be definitively settled. Such collision has never the less recently taken place by occurrences the precise character of which has not yet been ascertained. A communication from the governor of the State of Maine with accompanying documents and a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister of Great Britain on this subject are now communicated. Measures have been taken to ascertain the state of the facts more correctly by the employment of a special agent to visit the spot where the alleged outrages have occurred the result of those inquiries when received will be transmitted to Congress. While so many of the subjects of high interest to the friendly relations between the two countries have been so far adjusted it is a matter of regret that their s respecting the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British colonial possessions have not equally approximated to a friendly agreement. At the commencement of the last session of Congress they were informed of the sudden and unexpected exclusion by the British Government of access in vessels of the United States to all their colonial ports except those immediately bordering upon our own territories. In the amicable discussions which have succeeded the adoption of this measure which as it affected harshly the interests of the United States became subject of expostulation on our part the principles upon which its justification has been placed have been of a ersified character. It has been at once ascribed to a mere recurrence to the old long established principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to a feeling of resentment because the offers of an act of Parliament opening the colonial ports upon certain conditions had not been grasped at with sufficient eagerness by an instantaneous conformity to them. At a subsequent period it has been intimated that the new exclusion was in resentment because a prior act of Parliament of 1822 opening certain colonial ports under heavy and burdensome restrictions to vessels of the United States had not been reciprocated by an admission of British vessels from the colonies and their cargoes without any restriction or discrimination what ever. But be the motive for the interdiction what it may the British Government have manifested no disposition either by negotiation or by corresponding legislative enactments to recede from it and we have been given distinctly to understand that neither of the bills which were under the conseration of Congress at their last session would have been deemed sufficient in their concessions to have been rewarded by any relaxation from the British interdict. It is one of the inconveniences inseparably connected with the attempt to adjust by reciprocal legislation interests of this nature that neither party can know what would be satisfactory to the other and that after enacting a statute for the avowed and sincere purpose of conciliation it will generally be found utterly inadequate to the expectation of the other party and will terminate in mutual disappointment. The session of Congress having terminated without any act upon the subject a proclamation was issued on 18270317 conformably to the provisions of the 6th section of the act of 18230301 declaring the fact that the trade and intercourse authorized by the British act of Parliament of 18220624 between the United States and the British enumerated colonial ports had been by the subsequent acts of Parliament of 18250705 and the order of council of 18260727 prohibited. The effect of this proclamation by the terms of the act under which it was issued has been that each and every provision of the act concerning igation of 18180418 and of the act supplementary thereto of 18200515 revived and is in full force. Such then is the present condition of the trade that useful as it is to both parties it can with a single momentary exception be carried on directly by the vessels of neither. That exception itself is found in a proclamation of the governor of the island of St. Christopher and of the Virgin Islands inviting for 3 months from 18270828 the importation of the articles of the produce of the United States which constitute their export portion of this trade in the vessels of all nations. That period having already expired the state of mutual interdiction has again taken place. The British Government have not only declined negotiation upon this subject but by the principle they have assumed with reference to it have precluded even the means of negotiation. It becomes not the self respect of the United States either to solicit gratuitous favors or to accept as the grant of a favor that for which an ample equivalent is exacted. It remains to be determined by the respective Governments whether the trade shall be opened by acts of reciprocal legislation. It is in the mean time satisfactory to know that apart from the inconvenience resulting from a disturbance of the usual channels of trade no loss has been sustained by the commerce the igation or the revenue of the United States and none of magnitude is to be apprehended from this existing state of mutual interdict. With the other maritime and commercial nations of Europe our intercourse continues with little variation. Since the cessation by the convention of 18220624 of all discriminating duties upon the vessels of the United States and of France in either country our trade with that nation has increased and is increasing. A disposition on the part of France has been manifested to renew that negotiation and in acceding to the proposal we have expressed the wish that it might be extended to other subjects upon which a good understanding between the parties would be beneficial to the interests of both. The origin of the political relations between the United States and France is coeval with the first years of our independence. The memory of it is interwoven with that of our arduous struggle for national existence. Weakened as it has occasionally been since that time it can by us never be forgotten and we should hail with exultation the moment which should indicate a recollection equally friendly in spirit on the part of France. A fresh effort has recently been made by the minister of the United States resing at Paris to obtain a conseration of the just claims of citizens of the United States to the reparation of wrongs long since committed many of them frankly acknowledged and all of them entitled upon every principle of justice to a cand examination. The proposal last made to the French Government has been to refer the subject which has formed an obstacle to this conseration to the determination of a sovereign the common friend of both. To this offer no definitive answer has yet been received but the gallant and honorable spirit which has at all times been the pre and glory of France will not ultimately permit the demands of innocent sufferers to be extinguished in the mere consciousness of the power to reject them. A new treaty of amity igation and commerce has been concluded with the Kingdom of Sweden which will be submitted to the Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification. At a more recent date a minister plenipotentiary from the Hanseatic Republics of Hamburg Lubeck and Bremen has been received charged with a special mission for the negotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between that ancient and renowned league and the United States. This negotiation has accordingly been commenced and is now in progress the result of which will if successful be also submitted to the Senate for their conseration. Since the accession of the Emperor Nicholas to the imperial throne of all the Russias the friendly dispositions toward the United States so constantly manifested by his predecessor have continued unabated and have been recently testified by the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to rese at this place. From the interest taken by this Sovereign in behalf of the suffering Greeks and from the spirit with which others of the great European powers are cooperating with him the friends of freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that they will obtain relief from that most unequal of conflicts which they have so long and so gallantly sustained; that they will enjoy the blessing of self government which by their sufferings in the cause of liberty they have richly earned and that their independence will be secured by those liberal institutions of which their country furnished the earliest examples in the history of mankind and which have consecrated to immortal remembrance the very soil for which they are now again profusely pouring forth their blood. The sympathies which the people and Government of the United States have so warmly indulged with their cause have been acknowledged by their Government in a letter of thanks which I have received from their illustrious Present a translation of which is now communicated to Congress the representatives of that nation to whom this tribute of gratitude was intended to be pa and to whom it was justly due. In the American hemisphere the cause of freedom and independence has continued to prevail and if signalized by none of those splend triumphs which had crowned with glory some of the preceding years it has only been from the banishment of all external force against which the struggle had been maintained. The shout of victory has been superseded by the expulsion of the enemy over whom it could have been achieved. Our friendly wishes and cordial good will which have constantly followed the southern nations of America in all the vicissitudes of their war of independence are succeeded by a solicitude equally ardent and cordial that by the wisdom and purity of their institutions they may secure to themselves the choicest blessings of social order and the best rewards of virtuous liberty. Disclaiming alike all right and all intention of interfering in those concerns which it is the prerogative of their independence to regulate as to them shall seem fit we hail with joy every indication of their prosperity of their harmony of their persevering and inflexible homage to those principles of freedom and of equal rights which are alone suited to the genius and temper of the American nations. It has been therefore with some concern that we have observed indications of intestine isions in some of the Republics of the south and appearances of less union with one another than we believe to be the interest of all. Among the results of this state of things has been that the treaties concluded at Panama do not appear to have been ratified by the contracting parties and that the meeting of the congress at Tacubaya has been indefinitely postponed. In accepting the invitations to be represented at this congress while a manifestation was intended on the part of the United States of the most friendly disposition toward the southern Republics by whom it had been proposed it was hoped that it would furnish an opportunity for bringing all the nations of this hemisphere to the common acknowledgment and adoption of the principles in the regulation of their internal relations which would have secured a lasting peace and harmony between them and have promoted the cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe. But as obstacles appear to have arisen to the reassembling of the congress one of the 2 ministers commissioned on the part of the United States has returned to the bosom of his country while the minister charged with the ordinary mission to Mexico remains authorized to attend the conferences of the congress when ever they may be resumed. A hope was for a short time entertained that a treaty of peace actually signed between the Government of Buenos Ayres and of Brazil would supersede all further occasion for those collisions between belligerent pretensions and neutral rights which are so commonly the result of maritime war and which have unfortunately disturbed the harmony of the relations between the United States and the Brazilian Governments. At their last session Congress were informed that some of the al officers of that Empire had advanced and practiced upon principles in relation to ades and to neutral igation which we could not sanction and which our commanders found it necessary to resist. It appears that they have not been sustained by the Government of Brazil itself. Some of the vessels captured under the assumed authority of these erroneous principles have been restored and we trust that our just expectations will be realized that adequate indemnity will be made to all the citizens of the United States who have suffered by the unwarranted captures which the Brazilian tribunals themselves have pronounced unlawful. In the diplomatic discussions at Rio de Janeiro of these wrongs sustained by citizens of the United States and of others which seemed as if emanating immediately from that Government itself the charge' d'affaires of the United States under an impression that his representations in behalf of the rights and interests of his countrymen were totally disregarded and useless deemed it his duty without waiting for instructions to terminate his official s to demand his pass ports and return to the United States. This movement dictated by an honest zeal for the honor and interests of his country  motives which operated exclusively on the mind of the officer who resorted to it  has not been disapproved by me. The Brazilian Government however complained of it as a measure for which no adequate intentional cause had been given by them and upon an explicit assurance through their charge' d'affaires resing here that a successor to the late representative of the United States near that Government the appointment of whom they desired should be received and treated with the respect due to his character and that indemnity should be promptly made for all injuries inflicted on citizens of the United States or their property contrary to the laws of nations a temporary commission as charge' d'affaires to that country has been issued which it is hopes will entirely restore the ordinary diplomatic intercourse between the 2 Governments and the friendly relations between their respective nations. Turning from the momentous concerns of our Union in its intercourse with foreign nations to those of the deepest interest in the administration of our internal affairs we find the revenues of the present year corresponding as nearly as might be expected with the anticipations of the last and presenting an aspect still more favorable in the promise of the next. The balance in the Treasury on 18270101 was $6358686.18. The receipts from that day to 18270930 as near as the returns of them yet received can show amount to $16886581.32. The receipts of the present quarter estimated at $4515000 added to the above form an aggregate of $21400000 of receipts. The expenditures of the year may perhaps amount to $22300000 presenting a small excess over the receipts. But of these $22000000 upward of $6000000 have been applied to the discharge of the principal of the public debt the whole amount of which approaching $74000000 on 18270101 will on 18280101 fall short of $67500000. The balance in the Treasury on 18280101 it is expected will exceed $5450000 a sum exceeding that of 18250101 though falling short of that exhibited on 18270101. It was foreseen that the revenue of the present year 1827 would not equal that of the last which had itself been less than that of the next preceding year. But the hope has been realized which was entertained that these deficiencies would in no wise interrupt the steady operation of the discharge of the public debt by the annual $10000000 devoted to that object by the act of 18170303. The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the commencement of the year until 18270930 is $21226000 and the probably amount of that which will be secured during the remainder of the year is $5774000 forming a sum total of $27000000. With the allowances for drawbacks and contingent deficiencies which may occur though not specifically foreseen we may safely estimate the receipts of the ensuing year at $22300000  a revenue for the next equal to the expenditure of the present year. The deep solicitude felt by our citizens of all es throughout the Union for the total discharge of the public debt will apologize for the earnestness with which I deem it my duty to urge this topic upon the conseration of Congress  of recommending to them again the observance of the strictest economy in the application of the public funds. The depression upon the receipts of the revenue which had commenced with the year 1826 continued with increased severity during the two first quarters of the present year. The returning te began to flow with the third quarter and so far as we can judge from experience may be expected to continue through the course of the ensuing year. In the mean time an alleviation from the burden of the public debt will in the three years have been effected to the amount of nearly $16000000 and the charge of annual interest will have been reduced upward of $1000000. But among the maxims of political economy which the stewards of the public moneys should never suffer without urgent necessity to be transcended is that of keeping the expenditures of the year within the limits of its receipts. The appropriations of the two last years including the yearly $10000000 of the sinking fund have each equaled the promised revenue of the ensuing year. While we foresee with confence that the public coffers will be replenished from the receipts as fast as they will be drained by the expenditures equal in amount to those of the current year it should not be forgotten that they could ill suffer the exhaustion of larger disbursements. The condition of the Army and of all the branches of the public service under the superintendence of the Secretary of War will be seen by the report from that officer and the documents with which it is accompanied. During the last summer a detachment of the Army has been usefully and successfully called to perform their appropriate duties. At the moment when the commissioners appointed for carrying into execution certain provisions of the treaty of 18250819 with various tribes of the NorthWestern Indians were about to arrive at the appointed place of meeting the unprovoked murder of several citizens and other acts of unequivocal hostility committed by a party of the Winnebago tribe one of those associated in the treaty followed by indications of a menacing character among other tribes of the same region rendered necessary an immediate display of the defensive and protective force of the Union in that quarter. It was accordingly exhibited by the immediate and concerted movements of the governors of the State of Illinois and of the Territory of Michigan and competent levies of militia under their authority with a corps of 700 men of United States troops under the command of General Atkinson who at the call of Governor Cass immediately repaired to the scene of danger from their station at St. Louis. Their presence dispelled the alarms of our fellow citizens on those disorders and overawed the hostile purposes of the Indians. The perpetrators of the murders were surrendered to the authority and operation of our laws and every appearance of purposed hostility from those Indian tribes has subsed. Although the present organization of the Army and the administration of its various branches of service are upon the whole satisfactory they are yet susceptible of much improvement in particulars some of which have been heretofore submitted to the conseration of Congress and others are now first presented in the report of the Secretary of War. The expediency of proving for additional numbers of officers in the two corps of engineers will in some degree depend upon the number and extent of the objects of national importance upon which Congress may think it proper that surveys should be made conformably to the act of 18240430. Of the surveys which before the last session of Congress had been made under the authority of that act reports were made  Of the Board of Internal Improvement on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. On the continuation of the national road from Cumberland to the te waters within the District of Columbia. On the continuation of the national road from Canton to Zanesville. On the location of the national road from Zanesville to Columbus. On the continuation of the same to the seat of government in Missouri. On a post road from Baltimore to Philadelphia. Of a survey of Kennebec River (in part). On a national road from Washington to Buffalo. On the survey of Saugatuck Harbor and River. On a canal from Lake PontChartrain to the Mississippi River. On surveys at Edgartown Newburyport and Hyannis Harbor. On survey of La Plaisance Bay in the Territory of Michigan. And reports are now prepared and will be submitted to Congress  On surveys of the peninsula of Flora to ascertain the practicability of a canal to connect the waters of the Atlantic with the Gulf of Mexico across that peninsula; and also of the country between the bays of Mobile and of Pensacola with the  of connecting them together by a canal. On surveys of a route for a canal to connect the waters of James and Great Kenhawa rivers. On the survey of the Swash in Pamlico Sound and that of Cape Fear below the town of Wilmington in North Carolina. On the survey of the Muscle Shoals in the Tennessee River and for a route for a cond communication between the Hiwassee and Coosa rivers in the State of Alabama. Other reports of surveys upon objects pointed out by the several acts of Congress of the last and preceding sessions are in the progress of preparation and most of them may be completed before the close of this session. All the officers of both corps of engineers with several other persons duly qualified have been constantly employed upon these services from the passage of the act of 18240430 to this time. Were no other advantage to accrue to the country from their labors than the fund of topographical knowledge which they have collected and communicated that alone would have been a profit to the Union more than adequate to all the expenditures which have been devoted to the object; but the appropriations for the repair and continuation of the Cumberland road for the construction of various other roads for the removal of obstructions from the rivers and harbors for the erection of light houses beacons piers and buoys and for the completion of canals undertaken by inual associations but needing the assistance of means and resources more comprehensive than inual enterprise can command may be consered rather as treasures la up from the contributions of the present age for the benefit of posterity than as unrequited applications of the accruing revenues of the nation. To such objects of permanent improvement to the condition of the country of real addition to the wealth as well as to the comfort of the people by whose authority and resources they have been effected from $3000000 to $4000000 of the annual income of the nation have by laws enacted at the three most recent sessions of Congress been applied without intrenching upon the necessities of the Treasury without adding a dollar to the taxes or debts of the community without suspending even the steady and regular discharge of the debts contracted in former days which within the same three ye
rs have been diminished by the amount of nearly $16000000. The same observations are in a great degree applicable to the appropriations made for fortifications upon the coasts and harbors of the United States for the maintenance of the Military Academy at West Point and for the various objects under the superintendence of the Department of the Navy. The report from the Secretary of the Navy and those from the subordinate branches of both the military departments exhibit to Congress in minute detail the present condition of the public establishments dependent upon them the execution of the acts of Congress relating to them and the s of the officers engaged in the several branches of the service concerning the improvements which may tend to their perfection. The fortification of the coasts and the gradual increase and improvement of the Navy are parts of a great system of national defense which has been upward of 10 years in progress and which for a series of years to come will continue to claim the constant and persevering protection and superintendence of the legislative authority. Among the measures which have emanated from these principles the act of the last session of Congress for the gradual improvement of the Navy holds a conspicuous place. The collection of timber for the future construction of vessels of war the preservation and reproduction of the species of timber peculiarly adapted to that purpose the construction of dry docks for the use of the Navy the erection of a marine railway for the repair of the public ships and the improvement of the y yards for the preservation of the public property deposited in them have all received from the Executive the attention required by that act and will continue to receive it steadily proceeding toward the execution of all its purposes. The establishment of a al academy furnishing the means of theoretic instruction to the youths who devote their lives to the service of their country upon the ocean still solicits the sanction of the Legislature. Practical seamanship and the art of igation may be acquired on the cruises of the squadrons which from time to time are dispatched to distant seas but a competent knowledge even of the art of ship building the higher mathematics and astronomy; the literature which can place our officers on a level of polished education with the officers of other maritime nations; the knowledge of the laws municipal and national which in their intercourse with foreign states and their governments are continually called into operation and above all that acquaintance with the principles of honor and justice with the higher obligations of morals and of general laws human and ine which constitutes the great distinction between the warriorpatriot and the licensed robber and pirate  these can be systematically taught and eminently acquired only in a permanent school stationed upon the shore and proved with the teachers the instruments and the books conversant with and adapted to the communication of the principles of these respective sciences to the youthful and inquiring mind. The report from the PostMaster General exhibits the condition of that Department as highly satisfactory for the present and still more promising for the future. Its receipts for the year ending 18270701 amounted to $1473551 and exceeded its expenditures by upward of $100000. It can not be an over sanguine estimate to predict that in less than 10 years of which half have elapsed the receipts will have been more than doubled. In the mean time a reduced expenditure upon established routes has kept pace with increased facilities of public accommodation and additional services have been obtained at reduced rates of compensation. Within the last year the transportation of the mail in stages has been greatly augmented. The number of post offices has been increased to 7000 and it may be anticipated that while the facilities of intercourse between fellow citizens in person or by correspondence will soon be carried to the door of every villager in the Union a yearly surplus of revenue will accrue which may be applied as the wisdom of Congress under the exercise of their constitutional powers may devise for the further establishment and improvement of the public roads or by adding still further to the facilities in the transportation of the mails. Of the indications of the prosperous condition of our country none can be more pleasing than those presented by the multiplying relations of personal and intimate intercourse between the citizens of the Union dwelling at the remotest distances from each other. Among the subjects which have heretofore occupied the earnest solicitude and attention of Congress is the management and disposal of that portion of the property of the nation which consists of the public lands. The acquisition of them made at the expense of the whole Union not only in treasury but in blood marks a right of property in them equally extensive. By the report and statements from the General Land Office now communicated it appears that under the present Government of the United States a sum little short of $33000000 has been pa from the common Treasury for that portion of this property which has been purchased from France and Spain and for the extinction of the aboriginal titles. The amount of lands acquired is near 260000000 acres of which on 18260101 about 139000000 acres had been surveyed and little more than 19000000 acres had been sold. The amount pa into the Treasury by the purchasers of the public lands sold is not yet equal to the sums pa for the whole but leaves a small balance to be refunded. The proceeds of the sales of the lands have long been pledged to the creditors of the nation a pledge from which we have reason to hope that they will in a very few years be redeemed. The system upon which this great national interest has been managed was the result of long anxious and persevering deliberation. Matured and modified by the progress of our population and the lessons of experience it has been hitherto eminently successful. More than 9/10 of the lands still remain the common property of the Union the appropriation and disposal of which are sacred trusts in the hands of Congress. Of the lands sold a conserable part were conveyed under extended credits which in the vicissitudes and fluctuations in the value of lands and of their produce became oppressively burdensome to the purchasers. It can never be the interest or the policy of the nation to wring from its own citizens the reasonable profits of their industry and enterprise by holding them to the rigorous import of disastrous engagements. In 182103 a debt of $22000000 due by purchasers of the public lands had accumulated which they were unable to pay. An act of Congress of 18210302 came to their relief and has been succeeded by others the latest being the act of 18260504 the indulgent provisions of which expired on 18270704. The effect of these laws has been to reduce the debt from the purchasers to a remaining balance of about $4300000 due more than 3/5 of which are for lands within the State of Alabama. I recommend to Congress the revival and continuance for a further term of the beneficent accommodations to the public debtors of that statute and submit to their conseration in the same spirit of equity the remission under proper discriminations of the forfeitures of partial payments on account of purchases of the public lands so far as to allow of their application to other payments. There are various other subjects of deep interest to the whole Union which have heretofore been recommended to the conseration of Congress as well by my predecessors as under the impression of the duties devolving upon me by myself. Among these are the debt rather of justice than gratitude to the surviving warriors of the Revolutionary war; the extension of the judicial administration of the Federal Government to those extensive since the organization of the present judiciary establishment now constitute at least 1/3 of its territory power and population; the formation of a more effective and uniform system for the government of the militia and the amelioration in some form or modification of the ersified and often oppressive codes relating to insolvency. Amst the multiplicity of topics of great national concernment which may recommend themselves to the calm and patriotic deliberations of the Legislature it may suffice to say that on these and all other measures which may receive their sanction my hearty cooperation will be given conformably to the duties enjoined upon me and under the sense of all the obligations prescribed by the Constitution. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:I lay before Congress copies of the treaty of peace and amity between the United States and His Britannic Majesty which was signed by the commissioners of both parties at Ghent on the 24th of December 1814 and the ratifications of which have been duly exchanged.While performing this act I congratulate you and our constituents upon an event which is highly honorable to the nation and terminates with peculiar felicity a campaign signalized by the most brilliant successes.The late war although reluctantly declared by Congress had become a necessary resort to assert the rights and independence of the nation. It has been waged with a success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative councils of the patriotism of the people of the public spirit of the militia and of the valor of the military and al forces of the country Peace at all times a blessing is peculiarly wel come therefore at a period when the causes for the war have ceased to operate when the Government has demonstrated the efficiency of its powers of defense and when the nation can re its conduct without regret and without reproach.I recommend to your care and beneficence the gallant men whose achievements in every department of the military ser vice on the land and on the water have so essentially con tributed to the honor of the American name and to the restoration of peace. The feelings of conscious patriotism and worth will animate such men under every change of for tune and pursuit but their country performs a duty to itself when it bestows those testimonials of approbation and  which are at once the reward and the incentive to great actions.The reduction of the public expenditures to the demands of a peace establishment will doubtless engage the immediate attention of Congress There are however important cons erations which forb a sudden and general revocation of the measures that have been produced by the war Experience has taught us that neither the pacific dispositions of the American people nor the pacific character of their political institutions can altogether exempt them from that strife which appears beyond the ordinary lot of nations to be incent to the ac tual period of the world and the same faithful monitor dem onstrates that a certain degree of preparation for war is not only indispensable to avert disasters in the onset but affords also the best security for the continuance of peace The wisdom of Congress will therefore I am confent prove for the maintenance of an adequate regular force for the gradual advancement of the al establishment for improving all the means of harbor defense for adding discipline to the distin guished bravery of the militia and for cultivating the military art in its essential branches under the liberal patronage of Government.The resources of our country were at all times competent to the attainment of every national object but they will now be enriched and invigorated by the activity which peace will introduce into all the scenes of domestic enterprise and labor.The provision that has been made for the public creditors during the present session of Congress must have a decisive effect in the establishment of the public credit both at home and abroad The reviving interests of commerce will claim the legislative attention at the earliest opportunity and such reg ulations will I trust be seasonably devised as shall secure to the United States their just proportion of the igation of the world The most liberal policy toward other nations if met by corresponding dispositions will in this respect be found the most beneficial policy toward ourselves But there is no subject that can enter with greater force and merit into the deliberations of Congress than a conseration of the means to preserve and promote the manufactures which have sprung into existence and attained an unparalleled maturity throughout the United States during the period of the Euro pean wars This source of national independence and wealth I anxiously recommend therefore to the prompt and constant guardianship of Congress.The termination of the legislative sessions will soon sepa rate you fellowcitizens from each other and restore you to your constituents I pray you to bear with you the expressions of my sanguine hope that the peace which has been just declared will not only be the foundation of the most friendly intercourse between the United States and Great Britain but that it will also be productive of happiness and harmony in every section of our beloved country The influence of your precepts and example must be every where powerful and while we accord in grateful acknowledgments for the protec tion which Provence has bestowed upon us let us never cease to inculcate obedience to the laws and felity to the union as constituting the palladium of the national independence and prosperity.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA< A PROCLAMATION< Whereas the Congress of the United States by virtue of the constituted authority vested in them have declared by their act bearing date the 18th day of the present month that war exists between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the dependencies thereof and the United States of America and their Territories:< Now therefore I James Madison Present of the United States of America do hereby proclaim the same to all whom it may concern; and I do specially enjoin on all persons holding offices civil or military under the authority of the United States that they be vigilant and zealous in discharging the duties respectively incent thereto; and I do moreover exhort all the good people of the United States as they love their country as they value the precious heritage derived from the virtue and valor of their fathers as they feel the wrongs which have forced on them the last resort of injured nations and as they consult the best means under the blessing of Divine Provence of abrging its calamities that they exert themselves in preserving order in promoting concord in maintaining the authority and efficacy of the laws and in supporting and invigorating all the measures which may be adopted by the constituted authorities for obtaining a speedy a just and an honorable peace.< In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents. Done at the city of Washington the 19th day of June 1812 and of the Independence of the United States the thirtysixth. By the Present:< JAMES MADISON.< JAMES MONROE< Secretary of State.
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:Agreeably to the request of the House of Representatives communicated in their resolution of the 16th instant I proceed to state under the reserve therein expressed information received touching an illegal combination of private inuals against the peace and safety of the Union and a military expedition planned by them against the territories of a power in amity with the United States with the measures I have pursued for suppressing the same.I had for some time been in the constant expectation of receiving such further information as would have enabled me to lay before the legislature the termination as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity so far it has been acted on the Ohio and its waters. From this the state and safety of the lower country might have been estimated on probable grounds and the delay was indulged the rather because no circumstance had yet made it necessary to call in the a of the legislative s. Information now recently communicated has brought us nearly to the period cond. The mass of what I have received in the course of these transactions is voluminous but little has been given under the sanction of an oath so as to constitute formal and legal evence. It is chiefly in the form of letters often containing such a mixture of rumors conjectures and suspicions as render it difficult to sift out the real facts and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines strengthened by concurrent information or the particular credibility of the relater. In this state of the evence delivered sometimes too under the restriction of private confence neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names except that of the principal actor whose guilt is placed beyond question.Some time in the latter part of September I received intimations that designs were in agitation in the western country unlawful and unfriendly to the peace of the Union; and that the prime mover in these was Aaron Burr heretofore distinguished by the favor of his country. The grounds of these intimations being inconclusive the objects uncertain and the felity of that country known to be firm the only measure taken was to urge the informants to use their best endeavors to get further insight into the designs and proceedings of the suspected persons and to communicate them to me.It was not until the latter part of October that the objects of the conspiracy began to be perceived but still so blended and involved in mystery that nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit. In this state of uncertainty as to the crime cond the acts done and the legal course to be pursued I thought it best to send to the scene where these things were principally in transaction a person in whose integrity understanding and discretion entire confence could be reposed with instructions to investigate the plots going on to enter into conference (for which he had sufficient credentials) with the governors and all other officers civil and military and with their a to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the designs of the conspirators arrest their means bring their persons to punishment and to call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which it should be found they were engaged. By this time it was known that many boats were under preparation stores of provisions collecting and an unusual number of suspicious characters in motion on the Ohio and its waters. Beses despatching the confential agent to that quarter orders were at the same time sent to the governors of the Orleans and Mississippi territories and to the commanders of the land and al forces there to be on their guard against surprise and in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which might be attempted on the vessels posts or other objects under their care; and on the 8th of November instructions were forwarded to General Wilkinson to hasten an accommodation with the Spanish commander on the Sabine and as soon as that was effected to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the Mississippi for the defence of the intersecting points on that river. By a letter received from that officer on the 25th of November but dated October 21st we learn that a confential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him with communications partly written in cipher and partly oral explaining his designs exaggerating his resources and making such offers of emolument and command to engage him and the army in his unlawful enterprise as he had flattered himself would be successful. The general with the honor of a soldier and felity of a good citizen immediately despatched a trusty officer to me with information of what had passed proceeding to establish such an understanding with the Spanish commandant on the Sabine as permitted him to withdraw his force across the Mississippi and to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise.The general's letter which came to hand on the 25th of November as has been mentioned and some other information received a few days earlier when brought together developed Burr's general designs different parts of which only had been revealed to different informants. It appeared that he cond two distinct objects which might be carried on either jointly or separately and either the one or the other first as circumstances should direct. One of these was the severance of the Union of these States by the Alleghany mountains; the other an attack on Mexico. A third object was proved merely ostensible to wit: the settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the Washita claimed by a Baron Bastrop. This was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations an allurement for such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country and a cover under which to retreat in the event of final discomfiture of both branches of his real design.found at once that the attachment of the western country to the present Union was not to be shaken; that its dissolution could not be effected with the consent of its inhabitants and that his resources were inadequate as yet to effect it by force. took his course then at once determined to seize on New Orleans plunder the bank there possess himself of the military and al stores and proceed on his expedition to Mexico; and to this object all his means and preparations were now directed. collected from all the quarters where himself or his agents possessed influence all the ardent restless desperate and disaffected persons who were ready for any enterprise analogous to their characters. seduced good and wellmeaning citizens some by assurances that he possessed the confence of the government and was acting under its secret patronage a pretence which obtained some credit from the state of our differences with Spain; and others by offers of land in Bastrop's claim on the Washita.This was the state of my information of his proceedings about the last of November at which time therefore it was first possible to take specific measures to meet them. The proclamation of November 27 two days after the receipt of General Wilkinson's information was now issued. Orders were despatched to every intersecting point on the Ohio and Mississippi from Pittsburg to New Orleans for the employment of such force either of the regulars or of the militia and of such proceedings also of the civil authorities as might enable them to seize on all the boats and stores proved for the enterprise to arrest the persons concerned and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise. A little before the receipt of these orders in the State of Ohio our confential agent who had been diligently employed in investigating the conspiracy had acquired sufficient information to open himself to the governor of that State and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the State to crush the combination. Governor Tiffin and the legislature with a promptitude an energy and patriotic zeal which entitle them to a distinguished place in the affection of their sister States effected the seizure of all the boats provisions and other preparations within their reach and thus gave a first blow materially disabling the enterprise in its outset.In Kentucky a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice without sufficient evence for his conviction had produced a popular impression in his favor and a general disbelief of his guilt. This gave him an unfortunate opportunity of hastening his equipments. The arrival of the proclamation and orders and the application and information of our confential agent at length awakened the authorities of that State to the truth and then produced the same promptitude and energy of which the neighboring State had set the example. Under an act of their legislature of December 23 militia was instantly ordered to different important points and measures taken for doing whatever could yet be done. Some boats (accounts vary from five to double or treble that number) and persons (differently estimated from one to three hundred) had in the meantime passed the falls of the Ohio to rendezvous at the mouth of the Cumberland with others expected down that river.Not apprized till very late that any boats were building on Cumberland the effect of the proclamation had been trusted to for some time in the State of Tennessee; but on the 19th of December similar communications and instructions with those of the neighboring States were despatched by express to the governor and a general officer of the western ision of the State and on the 23rd of December our confential agent left Frankfort for Nashville to put into activity the means of that State also. But by information received yesterday I learn that on the 22rd of December Mr. Burr descended the Cumberland with two boats merely of accommodation carrying with him from that State no quota toward his unlawful enterprise. Whether after the arrival of the proclamation of the orders or of our agent any exertion which could be made by that State or the orders of the governor of Kentucky for calling out the militia at the mouth of Cumberland would be in time to arrest these boats and those from the falls of the Ohio is still doubtful.On the whole the fugitives from Ohio with their associates from Cumberland or any other place in that quarter cannot threaten serious danger to the city of New Orleans.By the same express of December nineteenth orders were sent to the governors of New Orleans and Mississippi supplementary to those which had been given on the 25th of November to hold the militia of their territories in readiness to cooperate for their defence with the regular troops and armed vessels then under command of General Wilkinson. Great alarm indeed was excited at New Orleans by the exaggerated accounts of Mr. Burr disseminated through his emissaries of the armies and ies he was to assemble there. General Wilkinson had arrived there himself on the 24th of November and had immediately put into activity the resources of the place for the purpose of its defence; and on the tenth of December he was joined by his troops from the Sabine. Great zeal was shown by the inhabitants generally the merchants of the place readily agreeing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for manning the armed vessels with their seamen and the other citizens manifesting unequivocal felity to the Union and a spirit of determined resistance to their expected assailants.Surmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive a from certain foreign powers. But these surmises are without proof or probability. The wisdom of the measures sanctioned by Congress at its last session had placed us in the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with whom we had any differences and nothing has happened since which makes it either their interest or ours to pursue another course. No change of measures has taken place on our part; none ought to take place at this time. With the one friendly arrangement was then proposed and the law deemed necessary on the failure of that was suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue. With the same power negotiation is still preferred and provisional measures only are necessary to meet the event of rupture. While therefore we do not deflect in the slightest degree from the course we then assumed and are still pursuing with mutual consent to restore a good understanding we are not to impute to them practices as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith and changing necessarily the relations of peace and justice between us to those of war. These surmises are therefore to be imputed to the vauntings of the author of this enterprise to multiply his partisans by magnifying the belief of his prospects and support.By letters from General Wilkinson of the 14th and 18th of September which came to hand two days after date of the resolution of the House of Representatives that is to say on the morning of the 18th instant I received the important affavit a copy of which I now communicate with extracts of so much of the letters as come within the scope of the resolution. By these it will be seen that of three of the principal emissaries of Mr. Burr whom the general had caused to be apprehended one had been liberated by <emhabeas corpusem and the two others being those particularly employed in the endeavor to corrupt the general and army of the United States have been embarked by him for our ports in the Atlantic States probably on the conseration that an impartial trial could not be expected during the present agitations of New Orleans and that that city was not as yet a safe place of confinement. As soon as these persons shall arrive they will be delivered to the custody of the law and left to such course of trial both as to place and process as its aries may direct. The presence of the highest judicial authorities to be assembled at this place within a few days the means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere and the a of the executive means should the judges have occasion to use them render it equally desirable for the criminals as for the public that being already removed from the place where they were first apprehended the first regular arrest should take place here and the course of proceedings receive here its proper direction. 
In compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our Federal Constitution and sanctioned by the example of my predecessors in the career upon which I am about to enter I appear my fellowcitizens in your presence and in that of Heaven to bind myself by the solemnities of religious obligation to the faithful performance of the duties allotted to me in the station to which I have been called.  In unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which I shall be governed in the fulfillment of those duties my first resort will be to that Constitution which I shall swear to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend. That revered instrument enumerates the powers and prescribes the duties of the Executive Magistrate and in its first words declares the purposes to which these and the whole action of the Government instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly devotedto form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity prove for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of this Union in their successive generations. Since the adoption of this social compact one of these generations has passed away. It is the work of our forefathers. Administered by some of the most eminent men who contributed to its formation through a most eventful period in the annals of the world and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war incental to the condition of associated man it has not disappointed the hopes and aspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age and nation. It has promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all; it has to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity secured the freedom and happiness of this people. We now receive it as a precious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its establishment doubly bound by the examples which they have left us and by the blessings which we have enjoyed as the fruits of their labors to transmit the same unimpaired to the succeeding generation. In the compass of thirtysix years since this great national covenant was instituted a body of laws enacted under its authority and in conformity with its provisions has unfolded its powers and carried into practical operation its effective energies. Subordinate departments have distributed the executive s in their various relations to foreign affairs to the revenue and expenditures and to the military force of the Union by land and sea. A coordinate department of the judiciary has expounded the Constitution and the laws settling in harmonious coincence with the legislative will numerous weighty questions of construction which the imperfection of human language had rendered uoable. The year of jubilee since the first formation of our Union has just elapsed; that of the declaration of our independence is at hand. The consummation of both was effected by this Constitution. Since that period a population of four millions has multiplied to twelve. A territory bounded by the Mississippi has been extended from sea to sea. New States have been admitted to the Union in numbers nearly equal to those of the first Confederation. Treaties of peace amity and commerce have been concluded with the principal dominions of the earth. The people of other nations inhabitants of regions acquired not by conquest but by compact have been united with us in the participation of our rights and duties of our burdens and blessings. The forest has fallen by the ax of our woodsmen; the soil has been made to teem by the tillage of our farmers; our commerce has whitened every ocean. The dominion of man over physical nature has been extended by the invention of our artists. Liberty and law have marched hand in hand. All the purposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively as under any other government on the globe and at a cost little exceeding in a whole generation the expenditure of other nations in a single year. Such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a Constitution founded upon the republican principle of equal rights. To admit that this picture has its shades is but to say that it is still the condition of men upon earth. From evilphysical moral and politicalit is not our claim to be exempt. We have suffered sometimes by the visitation of Heaven through disease; often by the wrongs and injustice of other nations even to the extremities of war; and lastly by dissensions among ourselvesdissensions perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of freedom but which have more than once appeared to threaten the dissolution of the Union and with it the overthrow of all the enjoyments of our present lot and all our earthly hopes of the future. The causes of these dissensions have been various founded upon differences of speculation in the theory of republican government; upon conflicting s of policy in our relations with foreign nations; upon jealousies of partial and sectional interests aggravated by prejudices and prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to entertain. It is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights has at the close of that generation by which it was formed been crowned with success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders. Union justice tranquillity the common defense the general welfare and the blessings of libertyall have been promoted by the Government under which we have lived. Standing at this point of time looking back to that generation which has gone by and forward to that which is advancing we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheering hope. From the experience of the past we derive instructive lessons for the future. Of the two great political parties which have ed the opinions and feelings of our country the cand and the just will now admit that both have contributed splend talents spotless integrity ardent patriotism and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and administration of this Government and that both have required a liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error. The revolutionary wars of Europe commencing precisely at the moment when the Government of the United States first went into operation under this Constitution excited a collision of sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all the passions and imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was involved in war and the Union was shaken to its center. This time of trial embraced a period of five and twenty years during which the policy of the Union in its relations with Europe constituted the principal basis of our political isions and the most arduous part of the action of our Federal Government. With the catastrophe in which the wars of the French Revolution terminated and our own subsequent peace with Great Britain this baneful weed of party strife was uprooted. From that time no difference of principle connected either with the theory of government or with our intercourse with foreign nations has existed or been called forth in force sufficient to sustain a continued combination of parties or to give more than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate. Our political creed is without a dissenting voice that can be heard that the will of the people is the source and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate government upon earth; that the best security for the beneficence and the best guaranty against the abuse of power consists in the freedom the purity and the frequency of popular elections; that the General Government of the Union and the separate governments of the States are all sovereignties of limited powers fellowservants of the same masters uncontrolled within their respective spheres uncontrollable by encroachments upon each other; that the firmest security of peace is the preparation during peace of the defenses of war; that a rigorous economy and accountability of public expenditures should guard against the aggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation; that the military should be kept in strict subordination to the civil power; that the freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate; that the policy of our country is peace and the ark of our salvation union are articles of faith upon which we are all now agreed. If there have been those who doubted whether a confederated representative democracy were a government competent to the wise and orderly management of the common concerns of a mighty nation those doubts have been dispelled; if there have been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the ruins of the Union they have been scattered to the winds; if there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation and antipathies against another they have been extinguished. Ten years of peace at home and abroad have assuaged the animosities of political contention and blended into harmony the most discordant elements of public opinion. There still remains one effort of magnanimity one sacrifice of prejudice and passion to be made by the inuals throughout the nation who have heretofore followed the standards of political party. It is that of discarding every remnant of rancor against each other of embracing as countrymen and friends and of yielding to talents and virtue alone that confence which in times of contention for principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge of party communion. The collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative opinions or in different s of administrative policy are in their nature transitory. Those which are founded on geographical isions adverse interests of soil climate and modes of domestic life are more permanent and therefore perhaps more dangerous. It is this which gives inestimable value to the character of our Government at once federal and national. It holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each inual State in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that of the Union. Whatsoever is of domestic concernment unconnected with the other members of the Union or with foreign lands belongs exclusively to the administration of the State governments. Whatsoever directly involves the rights and interests of the federative fraternity or of foreign powers is of the resort of this General Government. The duties of both are obvious in the general principle though sometimes perplexed with difficulties in the detail. To respect the rights of the State governments is the inviolable duty of that of the Union; the government of every State will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the whole. The prejudices everywhere too commonly entertained against distant strangers are worn away and the jealousies of jarring interests are allayed by the composition and s of the great national councils annually assembled from all quarters of the Union at this place. Here the distinguished men from every section of our country while meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of those by whom they are deputed learn to estimate the talents and do justice to the virtues of each other. The harmony of the nation is promoted and the whole Union is knit together by the sentiments of mutual respect the habits of social intercourse and the ties of personal friendship formed between the representatives of its several parts in the performance of their service at this metropolis. Passing from this general re of the purposes and injunctions of the Federal Constitution and their results as indicating the first traces of the path of duty in the discharge of my public trust I turn to the Administration of my immediate predecessor as the second. It has passed away in a period of profound peace how much to the satisfaction of our country and to the honor of our country's name is known to you all. The great features of its policy in general concurrence with the will of the Legislature have been to cherish peace while preparing for defensive war; to yield exact justice to other nations and maintain the rights of our own; to cherish the principles of freedom and of equal rights wherever they were proclaimed; to discharge with all possible promptitude the national debt; to reduce within the narrowest limits of efficiency the military force; to improve the organization and discipline of the Army; to prove and sustain a school of military science; to extend equal protection to all the great interests of the nation; to promote the civilization of the Indian tribes and to proceed in the great system of internal improvements within the limits of the constitutional power of the Union. Under the pledge of these promises made by that eminent citizen at the time of his first induction to this office in his career of eight years the internal taxes have been repealed; sixty millions of the public debt have been discharged; provision has been made for the comfort and relief of the aged and indigent among the surviving warriors of the Revolution; the regular armed force has been reduced and its constitution revised and perfected; the accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has been made more effective; the Floras have been peaceably acquired and our boundary has been extended to the Pacific Ocean; the independence of the southern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized and recommended by example and by counsel to the potentates of Europe; progress has been made in the defense of the country by fortifications and the increase of the Navy toward the effectual suppression of the African traffic in slaves; in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the cultivation of the soil and of the mind in exploring the interior regions of the Union and in preparing by scientific researches and surveys for the further application of our national resources to the internal improvement of our country. In this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate predecessor the line of duty for his successor is clearly delineated. To pursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our common condition instituted or recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere of my obligations. To the topic of internal improvement emphatically urged by him at his inauguration I recur with peculiar satisfaction. It is that from which I am convinced that the unborn millions of our posterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the Union; that in which the beneficent action of its Government will be most deeply felt and acknowledged. The magnificence and splendor of their public works are among the imperishable glories of the ancient republics. The roads and aqueducts of Rome have been the admiration of all after ages and have survived thousands of years after all her conquests have been swallowed up in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians. Some ersity of opinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of Congress for legislation upon objects of this nature. The most respectful deference is due to doubts originating in pure patriotism and sustained by venerated authority. But nearly twenty years have passed since the construction of the first national road was commenced. The authority for its construction was then unquestioned. To how many thousands of our countrymen has it proved a benefit? To what single inual has it ever proved an injury? Repeated liberal and cand discussions in the Legislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated the opinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power. I can not but hope that by the same process of friendly patient and persevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed. The extent and limitation of the powers of the General Government in relation to this transcendently important interest will be settled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all and every speculative scruple will be solved by a practical public blessing. Fellowcitizens you are acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of the recent election which have resulted in affording me the opportunity of addressing you at this time. You have heard the exposition of the principles which will direct me in the fulfillment of the high and solemn trust imposed upon me in this station. Less possessed of your confence in advance than any of my predecessors I am deeply conscious of the prospect that I shall stand more and oftener in need of your indulgence. Intentions upright and pure a heart devoted to the welfare of our country and the unceasing application of all the faculties allotted to me to her service are all the pledges that I can give for the faithful performance of the arduous duties I am to undertake. To the guance of the legislative councils to the assistance of the executive and subordinate departments to the friendly cooperation of the respective State governments to the cand and liberal support of the people so far as it may be deserved by honest industry and zeal I shall look for whatever success may attend my public service; and knowing that except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain with fervent supplications for His favor to His overruling provence I commit with humble but fearless confence my own fate and the future destinies of my country. 
< TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:  It would have been a source fellow citizens of much gratification if our last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that the belligerent nations whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce had become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their unrighteous edicts. That no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effect I lost no time in availing myself of the act authorizing a suspension in whole or in part of the several embargo laws. Our ministers at London and Paris were instructed to explain to the respective governments there our disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which the aggressions were originally founded and open a way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all ses had been reluctantly obstructed. As each of those governments had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other it was reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity of their profession and for restoring to the commerce of the United States its legitimate freedom. The instructions to our ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified with reference to their different circumstances and to the condition annexed by law to the executive power of suspension requiring a degree of security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of the decrees of France. Instead of a pledge therefore of a suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such a repeal it was presumed that a sufficient inducement might be found in other conserations and particularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent and a refusal by the other in the relations between the other and the United States. To Great Britain whose power on the ocean is so ascendant it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the United States their trade would be opened with her and remain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decrees also. From France no answer has been received nor any indication that the requisite change in her decrees is cond. The favorable reception of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be doubted as her orders of council had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the United States no longer to be pretended but as the arrangement proposed while it resisted the illegal decrees of France involved moreover substantially the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British orders. The arrangement has nevertheless been rejected. This cand and liberal experiment having thus failed and no other event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive was authorized it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it. We have the satisfaction however to reflect that in return for the privations by the measure and which our fellow citizens in general have borne with patriotism it has had the important effects of saving our mariners and our vast mercantile property as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called for by the occasion. It has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and firmness which govern our councils and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws and the rights of their country and has thus long frustrated those usurpations and spoliations which if resisted involve war; if submitted to sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence.Under a continuance of the belligerent measures which in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals overspread the ocean with danger it will rest with the wisdom of Congress to dece on the course best adapted to such a state of things; and bringing with them as they do from every part of the Union the sentiments of our constituents my confence is strengthened that in forming this decision they will with an unerring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation weigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens if I d not cherish an equal confence that the alternative chosen whatever it may be will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire.The documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce with the instructions given to our ministers at London and Paris are now la before you.The communications made to Congress at their last session explained the posture in which the close of the discussion relating to the attack by a British ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake left a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility. Every  of what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the British government for redressing a wrong which the more it was investigated appeared the more clearly to require what had not been proved for in the special mission. It is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose. On the contrary it will be seen in the documents la before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to; and moreover that it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council. The instructions which had been given to our ministers at London with a  to facilitate if necessary the reparation claimed by the United States are included in the documents communicated.Our relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material changes since your last session. The important negotiations with Spain which had been alternately suspended and resumed necessarily experience a pause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguished her internal situation.With the Barbary powers we continue in harmony with the exception of an unjustifiable proceeding of the dey of Algiers toward our consul to that regency. Its character and circumstances are now la before you and will enable you to dece how far it may either now or hereafter call for any measures not within the limits of the executive authority.With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained. Some instances of inual wrong have as at other times taken place but in nowise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mississippi the Iowas the Sacs and the Alabamas have delivered up for trial and punishment inuals from among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the United States. On this se of the Mississippi the Creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind; and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly persons of their tribe. And generally from a conviction that we conser them as part of ourselves and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily  is extending from the nearer to the more remote and will amply requite us for the justice and friendship practised towards them. Husbandry and household manufacture are advancing among them more raply with the southern than the northern tribes from circumstances of soil and climate; and one of the two great isions of the Cherokee nation have now under conseration to solicit the citizenship of the United States and to be entified with us in laws and government in such progressive manner as we shall think best.In consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for the security of our seaport towns and harbors such works of defence have been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places their relative importance and the scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation. These works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season except at New York and New Orleans where most was to be done; and although a great proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place yet some further s will be submitted by Congress for rendering its security entirely adequate against al enterprise. A  of what has been done at the several places and of what is proposed to be done shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.Of the gunboats authorized by the act of December last it has been thought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year. These with those before possessed are sufficient for the harbors and waters exposed and the resue will require little time for their construction when it is deemed necessary.Under the act of the last session for raising an additional military force so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying on the business of recruiting and in proportion as it advanced others have been added. We have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory although such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present to you a statement of the numbers engaged.I have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call for any general detachments of militia or volunteers under the law passed for that purpose. For the ensuing season however they will require to be in readiness should their services be wanted. Some small and special detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of new recruits. By the a of these and of the armed vessels called into actual service in other quarters the spirit of disobedience and abuse which manifested itself early and with sensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it has been conserably repressed.Consering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country. For a people who are free and who mean to remain so a wellorganized and armed militia is their best security. It is therefore incumbent on us at every meeting to revise the condition of the militia and to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed to invasion. Some of the States have pa a laudable attention to this object; but every degree of neglect is to be found among others. Congress alone have power to produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence; the interests which they so deeply feel in their own and their country's security will present this as among the most important objects of their deliberation.Under the acts of March 11th and April 23d respecting arms the difficulty of procuring them from abroad during the present situation and dispositions of Europe induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal supply. The public factories have therefore been enlarged additional machineries erected and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed their effect already more than doubled may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia. The annual sums appropriated by the latter act have been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms and contracts have been entered into with inual undertakers to nearly the amount of the first year's appropriation.The suspension of our foreign commerce produced by the injustice of the belligerent powers and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens are subjects of just concern. The situation into which we have thus been forced has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufactures and improvements. The extent of this conversion is daily increasing and little doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming will  under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence the freedom of labor from taxation with us and of protecting duties and prohibitions  become permanent. The commerce with the Indians too within our own boundaries is likely to receive abundant aliment from the same internal source and will secure to them peace and the progress of civilization undisturbed by practices hostile to both.The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending on the 30th day of September last being not yet made up a correct statement will hereafter be transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen millions of dollars which with the eight millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting the current demands and interest incurred to pay two millions three hundred thousand dollars of the principal of our funded debt and left us in the treasury on that day near fourteen millions of dollars. Of these five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary to pay what will be due on the first day of January next which will complete the reimbursement of the eight per cent. stock. These payments with those made in the six years and a half preceding will have extinguished thirtythree millions five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the funded debt being the whole which could be pa or purchased within the limits of the law and our contracts; and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from about two millions of dollars of interest and added that sum annually to the disposable surplus. The probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public debt whenever the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restored merits the conseration of Congress. Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the revenue be reduced? Or shall it rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads canals rivers education and other great foundations of prosperity and union under the powers which Congress may already possess or such amendment of the constitution as may be approved by the States? While uncertain of the course of things the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement should that be thought best.Availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing the two houses of the legislature at their meeting I cannot omit the expression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confence manifested to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration and the many indulgences experienced at their hands. The same grateful acknowledgments are due to my fellow citizens generally whose support has been my great encouragement under all embarrassments. In the transaction of their business I cannot have escaped error. It is incent to our imperfect nature. But I may say with truth my errors have been of the understanding not of intention; and that the advancement of their rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure. On these conserations I solicit their indulgence. Looking forward with anxiety to their future destinies I trust that in their steady character unshaken by difficulties in their love of liberty obedience to law and support of the public authorities I see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our republic; and retiring from the charge of their affairs I carry with me the consolation of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our beloved country long ages to come of prosperity and happiness.
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:   In calling you together fellow citizens at an earlier day than was cond by the act of the last session of Congress I have not been insensible to the personal inconveniences necessarily resulting from an unexpected change in your arrangements. But matters of great public concernment have rendered this call necessary and the interest you feel in these will supersede in your minds all private conserations.  Congress witnessed at their last session the extraordinary agitation produced in the public mind by the suspension of our right of deposit at the port of New Orleans no assignment of another place having been made according to treaty. They were sensible that the continuance of that privation would be more injurious to our nation than any consequences which could flow from any mode of redress but reposing just confence in the good faith of the government whose officer had committed the wrong friendly and reasonable representations were resorted to and the right of deposit was restored. Previous however to this period we had not been unaware of the danger to which our peace would be perpetually exposed while so important a key to the commerce of the western country remained under foreign power. Difficulties too were presenting themselves as to the igation of other streams which arising within our territories pass through those adjacent. Propositions had therefore been authorized for obtaining on fair conditions the sovereignty of New Orleans and of other possessions in that quarter interesting to our quiet to such extent as was deemed practicable; and the provisional appropriation of two millions of dollars to be applied and accounted for by the present of the United States intended as part of the price was consered as conveying the sanction of Congress to the acquisition proposed. The enlightened government of France saw with just discernment the importance to both nations of such liberal arrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace friendship and interests of both; and the property and sovereignty of all Louisiana which had been restored to them have on certain conditions been transferred to the United States by instruments bearing date the 30th of April last. When these shall have received the constitutional sanction of the senate they will without delay be communicated to the representatives also for the exercise of their s as to those conditions which are within the powers vested by the constitution in Congress. While the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the western States and an uncontrolled igation through their whole course free from collision with other powers and the dangers to our peace from that source the fertility of the country its climate and extent promise in due season important as to our treasury an ample provision for our posterity and a wespread field for the blessings of freedom and equal laws. With the wisdom of Congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures which may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary government of the country; for its incorporation into our Union; for rendering the change of government a blessing to our newlyadopted brethren; for securing to them the rights of conscience and of property: for confirming to the Indian inhabitants their occupancy and selfgovernment establishing friendly and commercial relations with them and for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired. Such materials for your information relative to its affairs in general as the short space of time has permitted me to collect will be la before you when the subject shall be in a state for your conseration. Another important acquisition of territory has also been made since the last session of Congress. The friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians with which we have never had a difference reduced by the wars and wants of savage life to a few inuals unable to defend themselves against the neighboring tribes has transferred its country to the United States reserving only for its members what is sufficient to maintain them in an agricultural way. The conserations stipulated are that we shall extend to them our patronage and protection and give them certain annual as in money in implements of agriculture and other articles of their choice. This country among the most fertile within our limits extending along the Mississippi from the mouth of the Illinois to and up the Ohio though not so necessary as a barrier since the acquisition of the other bank may yet be well worthy of being la open to immediate settlement as its inhabitants may descend with rapity in support of the lower country should future circumstances expose that to foreign enterprise. As the stipulations in this treaty also involve matters within the competence of both houses only it will be la before Congress as soon as the senate shall have advised its ratification. With many other Indian tribes improvements in agriculture and household manufacture are advancing and with all our peace and friendship are established on grounds much firmer than heretofore. The measure adopted of establishing trading houses among them and of furnishing them necessaries in exchange for their commodities at such moderated prices as leave no gain but cover us from loss has the most conciliatory and useful effect upon them and is that which will best secure their peace and good will. The small vessels authorized by Congress with a  to the Mediterranean service have been sent into that sea and will be able more effectually to confine the Tripoline cruisers within their harbors and supersede the necessity of convoy to our commerce in that quarter. They will sensibly lessen the expenses of that service the ensuing year. A further knowledge of the ground in the northeastern and northwestern angles of the United States has evinced that the boundaries established by the treaty of Paris between the British territories and ours in those parts were too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution. It has therefore been thought worthy of attention for preserving and cherishing the harmony and useful intercourse subsisting between the two nations to remove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incents might otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding. A convention has therefore been entered into which proves for a practicable demarkation of those limits to the satisfaction of both parties. An account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending 30th September last with the estimates for the service of the ensuing year will be la before you by the secretary of the treasury so soon as the receipts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more distant States. It is already ascertained that the amount pa into the treasury for that year has been between eleven and twelve millions of dollars and that the revenue accrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on as sufficient for our current expenses and to extinguish the public debt within the period heretofore proposed. The amount of debt pa for the same year is about three millions one hundred thousand dollars exclusive of interest and making with the payment of the preceding year a discharge of more than eight millions and a half of dollars of the principal of that debt beses the accruing interest; and there remain in the treasury nearly six millions of dollars. Of these eight hundred and eighty thousand have been reserved for payment of the first instalment due under the British convention of January 8th 1802 and two millions are what have been before mentioned as placed by Congress under the power and accountability of the present toward the price of New Orleans and other territories acquired which remaining untouched are still applicable to that object and go in diminution of the sum to be funded for it. Should the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and carried into effect a sum of nearly thirteen millions of dollars will then be added to our public debt most of which is payable after fifteen years; before which term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the established operation of the sinking fund. When we con the ordinary annual augmentation of imposts from increasing population and wealth the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new acquisition and the economies which may still be introduced into our public expenditures I cannot but hope that Congress in reing their resources will find means to meet the intermediate interests of this additional debt without recurring to new taxes and applying to this object only the ordinary progression of our revenue. Its extraordinary increase in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund for any measures of safety or precaution which that state of things may render necessary in our neutral position. Remittances for the instalments of our foreign debt having been found impracticable without loss it has not been thought expedient to use the power given by a former act of Congress of continuing them by reloans and of redeeming instead thereof equal sums of domestic debt although no difficulty was found in obtaining that accommodation. The sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress for proving gunboats remains unexpended. The favorable and peaceful turn of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary and time was desirable in order that the institution of that branch of our force might begin on models the most approved by experience. The same issue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of a million and a half of dollars cond for purposes which were effected by happier means. We have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again in Europe and nations with which we have the most friendly and useful relations engaged in mutual destruction. While we regret the miseries in which we see others involved let us bow with gratitude to that kind Provence which inspiring with wisdom and moderation our late legislative councils while placed under the urgency of the greatest wrongs guarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary contest and left us only to look on and to pity its ravages. These will be heaviest on those immediately engaged. Yet the nations pursuing peace will not be exempt from all evil. In the course of this conflict let it be our endeavor as it is our interest and desire to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nations by every act of justice and of incessant kindness; to receive their armed vessels with hospitality from the distresses of the sea but to administer the means of annoyance to none; to establish in our harbors such a police as may maintain law and order; to restrain our citizens from embarking inually in a war in which their country takes no part; to punish severely those persons citizen or alien who shall usurp the cover of our flag for vessels not entitled to it infecting thereby with suspicion those of real Americans and committing us into controversies for the redress of wrongs not our own; to exact from every nation the observance toward our vessels and citizens of those principles and practices which all civilized people acknowledge; to merit the character of a just nation and maintain that of an independent one preferring every consequence to insult and habitual wrong. Congress will conser whether the existing laws enable us efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens in all places and with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction and will give them the new modifications necessary for these objects. Some contraventions of right have already taken place both within our jurisdictional limits and on the high seas. The friendly disposition of the governments from whose agents they have proceeded as well as their wisdom and regard for justice leave us in reasonable expectation that they will be rectified and prevented in future; and that no act will be countenanced by them which threatens to disturb our friendly intercourse. Separated by a we ocean from the nations of Europe and from the political interests which entangle them together with productions and wants which render our commerce and friendship useful to them and theirs to us it cannot be the interest of any to assail us nor ours to disturb them. We should be most unwise indeed were we to cast away the singular blessings of the position in which nature has placed us the opportunity she has endowed us with of pursuing at a distance from foreign contentions the paths of industry peace and happiness; of cultivating general friendship and of bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force. How desirable then must it be in a government like ours to see its citizens adopt inually the s the interests and the conduct which their country should pursue esting themselves of those passions and partialities which tend to lessen useful friendships and to embarrass and embroil us in the calamitous scenes of Europe. Confent fellow citizens that you will duly estimate the importance of neutral dispositions toward the observance of neutral conduct that you will be sensible how much it is our duty to look on the bloody arena spread before us with commiseration indeed but with no other wish than to see it closed I am persuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions in all discussions among yourselves and in all communications with your constituents; and I anticipate with satisfaction the measures of wisdom which the great interests now committed to _you_ will give you an opportunity of proving and _myself_ that of approving and carrying into execution with the felity I owe to my country. 
Fellow citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:The assemblage of the representatives of our Union in both Houses of the Congress at this time occurs under circumstances calling for the renewed homage of our grateful acknowledgments to the Giver of All Good. With the exceptions incental to the most felicitous condition of human existence we continue to be highly favored in all the elements which contribute to inual comfort and to national prosperity. In the survey of our extensive country we have generally to observe abodes of health and regions of plenty. In our civil and political relations we have peace without and tranquillity within our borders. We are as a people increasing with unabated rapity in population wealth and national resources and whatever differences of opinion exist among us with regard to the mode and the means by which we shall turn the beneficence of Heaven to the improvement of our own condition there is yet a spirit animating us all which will not suffer the bounties of Provence to be showered upon us in vain but will receive them with grateful hearts and apply them with unwearied hands to the advancement of the general good.Of the subjects recommended to Congress at their last session some were then definitively acted upon. Others left unfinished but partly matured will recur to your attention without needing a renewal of notice from me. The purpose of this communication will be to present to your  the general aspect of our public affairs at this moment and the measures which have been taken to carry into effect the intentions of the legislature as signified by the laws then and heretofore enacted.In our intercourse with the other nations of the earth we have still the happiness of enjoying peace and a general good understanding qualified however in several important instances by collisions of interest and by unsatisfied claims of justice to the settlement of which the constitutional interposition of the legislative authority may become ultimately indispensable.By the decease of the Emperor Alexander of Russia which occurred contemporaneously with the commencement of the last session of Congress the United States have been deprived of a long tried steady and faithful friend. Born to the inheritance of absolute power and trained in the school of adversity from which no power on earth however absolute is exempt that monarch from his youth had been taught to feel the force and value of public opinion and to be sensible that the interests of his own government would best be promoted by a frank and friendly intercourse with this Republic as those of his people would be advanced by a liberal intercourse with our country. A cand and confential interchange of sentiments between him and the government of the U.S. upon the affairs of Southern America took place at a period not long preceding his demise and contributed to fix that course of policy which left to the other governments of Europe no alternative but that of sooner or later recognizing the independence of our southern neighbors of which the example had by the United States already been set.The ordinary diplomatic communications between his successor the Emperor Nicholas and the United States have suffered some interruption by the illness departure and subsequent decease of his minister resing here who enjoyed as he merited the entire confence of his new sovereign as he had eminently responded to that of his predecessor. But we have had the most satisfactory assurances that the sentiments of the reigning Emperor toward the United States are altogether conformable to those which had so long and constantly animated his imperial brother and we have reason to hope that they will serve to cement that harmony and good understanding between the two nations which founded in congenial interests can not but result in the advancement of the welfare and prosperity of both.Our relations of commerce and igation with France are by the operation of the convention of 18220624 with that nation in a state of gradual and progressive improvement. Convinced by all our experience no less than by the principles of fair and liberal reciprocity which the United States have constantly tendered to all the nations of the earth as the rule of commercial intercourse which they would universally prefer that fair and equal competition is most conducive to the interests of both parties the United States in the negotiation of that convention earnestly contended for a mutual renunciation of discriminating duties and charges in the ports of the two countries. Unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this principle in its full extent after reducing the duties of discrimination so far as was found attainable it was agreed that at the expiration of two years from 18221001 when the convention was to go into effect unless a notice of six months on either se should be given to the other that the convention itself must terminate those duties should be reduced onefourth and that this reducation should be yearly repeated until all discrimination should cease while the convention itself should continue in force. By the effect of this stipulation threefourths of the discriminating duties which had been levied by each party upon the vessels of the other in its ports have already been removed; and on the first of next October should the convention be still in force the remaining onefourth will be discontinued. French vessels laden with French produce will be received in our ports on the same terms as our own and ours in return will enjoy the same advantages in the ports of France.By these approximations to an equality of duties and of charges not only has the commerce between the two countries prospered but friendly dispositions have been on both ses encouraged and promoted. They will continue to be cherished and cultivated on the part of the United States. It would have been gratifying to have had it in my power to add that the claims upon the justice of the French government involving the property and the comfortable subsistence of many of our fellow citizens and which have been so long and so earnestly urged were in a more promising train of adjustment than at your last meeting; but their condition remains unaltered.With the government of the Netherlands the mutual abandonment of discriminating duties had been regulated by legislative acts on both ses. The act of Congress of 18180420 abolished all discriminating duties of impost and tonnage upon the vessels and produce of the Netherlands in the ports of the United States upon the assurance given by the government of the Netherlands that all such duties operating against the shipping and commerce of the United States in that Kingdom had been abolished. These reciprocal regulations had continued in force several years when the discriminating principle was resumed by the Netherlands in a new and indirect form by a bounty of 10 percent in the shape of a return of duties to their national vessels and in which those of the United States are not permitted to participate. By the act of Congress of 18240107 all discriminating duties in the United States were again suspended so far as related to the vessels and produce of the Netherlands so long as the reciprocal exemption should be extended to the vessels and produce of the United States in the Netherlands. But the same act proves that in the event of a restoration of discriminating duties to operate against the shipping and commerce of the United States in any of the foreign countries referred to therein the suspension of discriminating duties in favor of the igation of such foreign country should cease and all the provisions of the acts imposing discriminating foreign tonnage and impost duties in the United States should revive and be in full force with regard to that nation.In the correspondence with the government of the Netherlands upon this subject they have contended that the favor shown to their own shipping by this bounty upon their tonnage is not to be consered a discriminating duty; but it can not be denied that it produces all the same effects. Had the mutual abolition been stipulated by treaty such a bounty upon the national vessels could scarcely have been granted consistent with good faith. Yet as the act of Congress of 18240107 has not expressly authorized the Executive authority to determine what shall be consered as a revival of discriminating duties by a foreign government to the disadvantage of the United States and as the retaliatory measure on our part however just and necessary may tend rather to that conflict of legislation which we deprecate than to that concert to which we invite all commercial nations as most conducive to their interest and our own I have thought it more consistent with the spirit of our institutions to refer to the subject again to the paramount authority of the Legislature to dece what measure the emergency may require than abruptly by proclamation to carry into effect the minatory provisions of the act of 1824.During the last session of Congress treaties of amity igation and commerce were negotiated and signed at this place with the government of Denmark in Europe and with the federation of Central America in this hemisphere. These treaties then received the constitutional sanction of the Senate by the advice and consent to their ratification. They were accordingly ratified on the part of the U.S. and during the recess of Congress have been also ratified by the other respective contracting parties. The ratifications have been exchanged and they have been published by proclamations copies of which are herewith communicated to Congress.These treaties have established between the contracting parties the principles of equality and reciprocity in their broadest and most liberal extent each party admitting the vessels of the other into its ports laden with cargoes the produce or manufacture of any quarter of the globe upon the payment of the same duties of tonnage and impost that are chargeable upon their own. They have further stipulated that the parties shall hereafter grant no favor of igation or commerce to any other nation which shall not upon the same terms be granted to each other and that neither party will impose upon articles of merchandise the produce or manufacture of the other any other or higher duties than upon the like articles being the produce or manufacture of any other country. To these principles there is in the convention with Denmark an exception with regard to the colonies of that Kingdom in the arctic seas but none with regard to her colonies in the West Indies.In the course of the last summer the term to which our last commercial treaty with Sweden was limited has expired. A continuation of it is in the contemplation of the Swedish government and is believed to be desirable on the part of the United States. It has been proposed by the King of Sweden that pending the negotiation of renewal the expired treaty should be mutually consered as still in force a measure which will require the sanction of Congress to be carried into effect on our part and which I therefore recommend to your conseration.With Prussia Spain Portugal and in general all the European powers between whom and the United States relations of friendly intercourse have existed their condition has not materially varied since the last session of Congress. I regret not to be able to say the same of our commercial intercourse with the colonial possessions of Great Britain in America. Negotiations of the highest importance to our common interests have been for several years in discussion between the two governments and on the part of the United States have been invariably pursued in the spirit of candor and conciliation. Interests of great magnitude and delicacy had been adjusted by the conventions of 1815 and 1818 while that of 1822 mediated by the late Emperor Alexander had promised a satisfactory compromise of claims which the government of the U.S. in justice to the rights of a numerous  of their citizens was bound to sustain.But with regard to the commercial intercourse between the United States and the British colonies in America it has been hitherto found impracticable to bring the parties to an understanding satisfactory to both. The relative geographical position and the respective products of nature cultivated by human industry had constituted the elements of a commercial intercourse between the United States and British America insular and continental important to the inhabitants of both countries; but it had been interdicted by Great Britain upon a principle heretofore practiced upon by the colonizing nations of Europe of holding the trade of their colonies each in exclusive monopoly to herself.After the termination of the late war this interdiction had been revived and the British government declined including this portion of our intercourse with her possessions in the negotiation of the convention of 1815. The trade was then carried on exclusively in British vessels 'til the act of Congress concerning igation of 1818 and the supplemental act of 1820 met the interdict by a corresponding measure on the part of the United States. These measures not of retaliation but of necessary self defense were soon succeeded by an act of Parliament opening certain colonial ports to the vessels of the United States coming directly from them and to the importation from them of certain articles of our produce burdened with heavy duties and excluding some of the most valuable articles of our exports. The United States opened their ports to British vessels from the colonies upon terms as exactly corresponding with those of the act of Parliament as in the relative position of the parties could be made and a negotiation was commenced by mutual consent with the hope on our part that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common sentiment of the importance of the trade to the interests of the inhabitants of the two countries between whom it must be carried on would ultimately bring the parties to a compromise with which both might be satisfied. With this  the government of the United States had determined to sacrifice something of that entire reciprocity which in all commercial arrangements with foreign powers they are entitled to demand and to acquiesce in some inequalities disadvantageous to ourselves rather than to forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this interest to the satisfaction of Great Britain herself. The negotiation repeatedly suspended by accental circumstances was however by mutual agreement and express assent consered as pending and to be speedily resumed.In the mean time another act of Parliament so doubtful and ambiguous in its import as to have been misunderstood by the officers in the colonies who were to carry it into execution opens again certain colonial ports upon new conditions and terms with a threat to close them against any nation which may not accept those terms as prescribed by the British government. This act passed 1825–07 not communicated to the government of the U.S. not understood by the British officers of the customs in the colonies where it was to be enforced was never the less submitted to the conseration of Congress at their last session. With the knowledge that a negotiation upon the subject had long been in progress and pledges given of its resumption at an early day it was deemed expedient to await the result of that negotiation rather than to subscribe implicitly to terms the import of which was not clear and which the British authorities themselves in this hemisphere were not prepared to explain.Immediately after the close of the last session of Congress one of our most distinguished citizens was dispatched as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Great Britain furnished with instructions which we could not doubt would lead to a conclusion of this long controverted interest upon terms acceptable to Great Britain. Upon his arrival and before he had delivered his letters of credence he was bet by an order of the British council excluding from and after the first of December now current the vessels of the United States from all the colonial British ports excepting those immediately bordering on our territories. In answer to his expostulations upon a measure thus unexpected he is informed that according to the ancient maxims of policy of European nations having colonies their trade is an exclusive possession of the mother country; that all participation in it by other nations is a boon or favor not forming a subject of negotiation but to be regulated by the legislative acts of the power owning the colony; that the British government therefore declines negotiating concerning it and that as the U.S. d not forthwith accept purely and simply the terms offered by the act of Parliament of 1825–07 Great Britain would not now admit the vessels of the United States even upon the terms on which she has opened them to the igation of other nations.We have been accustomed to conser the trade which we have enjoyed with the British colonies rather as an interchange of mutual benefits than as a mere favor received; that under every circumstance we have given an ample equivalent. We have seen every other nation holding colonies negotiate with other nations and grant them freely admission to the colonies by treaty and so far are the other colonizing nations of Europe now from refusing to negotiate for trade with their colonies that we ourselves have secured access to the colonies of more than one of them by treaty. The refusal however of Great Britain to negotiate leaves to the United States no other alternative than that of regulating or interdicting altogether the trade on their part according as either measure may effect the interests of our own country and with that exclusive object I would recommend the whole subject to your calm and cand deliberations.It is hoped that our uailing exertions to accomplish a cordial good understanding on this interest will not have an unpropitious effect upon the other great topics of discussion between the two governments. Our northeastern and northwestern boundaries are still unadjusted. The commissioners under the seventh article of the Treaty of Ghent have nearly come to the close of their labors; nor can we renounce the expectation enfeebled as it is that they may agree upon their report to the satisfaction or acquiescence of both parties. The commission for liquating the claims for indemnity for slaves carried away after the close of the war has been sitting with doubtful prospects of success. Propositions of compromise have however passed between the two governments the result of which we flatter ourselves may yet prove unsatisfactory. Our own dispositions and purposes toward Great Britain are all friendly and conciliatory; nor can we abandon but with strong reluctance the belief that they will ultimately meet a return not of favors which we neither as nor desire but of equal reciprocity and good will.With the American governments of this hemisphere we continue to maintain an intercourse altogether friendly and between their nations and ours that commercial interchange of which mutual benefit is the source of mutual comfort and harmony the result is in a continual state of improvement. The war between Spain and them since the total expulsion of the Spanish military force from their continental territories has been little more than nominal and their internal tranquillity though occasionally menaced by the agitations which civil wars never fail to leave behind them has not been affected by any serious calamity.The congress of ministers from several of those nations which assembled at Panama after a short session there adjourned to meet again at a more favorable season in the neighborhood of Mexico. The decease of one of our ministers on his way to the Isthmus and the impediments of the season which delayed the departure of the other deprived United States of the advantage of being represented at the first meeting of the Congress. There is however no reason to believe that any transactions of the congress were of a nature to affect injuriously the interests of the United States or to require the interposition of our ministers had they been present. Their absence has indeed deprived United States of the opportunity of possessing precise and authentic information of the treaties which were concluded at Panama; and the whole result has confirmed me in the conviction of the expediency to the United States of being represented at the congress. The surviving member of the mission appointed during your last session has accordingly proceeded to his destination and a successor to his distinguished and lamented associate will be nominated to the Senate. A treaty of amity igation and commerce has in the course of the last summer been concluded by our minister plenipotentiary at Mexico with the united states of that Confederacy which will also be la before the Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification.In adverting to the present condition of our fiscal concerns and to the prospects of our revenue the first remark that calls our attention is that they are less exuberantly prosperous than they were at the corresponding period of the last year. The severe shock so extensively sustained by the commercial and manufacturing interests in Great Britain has not been without a perceptible recoil upon ourselves. A reduced importation from abroad is necessarily succeeded by a reduced return to the Treasury at home. The net revenue of the present year will not equal that of the last and the receipts of that which is to come will fall short of those in the current year. The diminution however is in part attributable to the flourishing condition of some of our domestic manufactures and so far is compensated by an equivalent more profitable to the nation.It is also highly gratifying to perceive that the deficiency in the revenue while it scarcely exceeds the anticipations of the last year's estimate from the Treasury has not interrupted the application of more than $11 million during the present year to the discharge of the principal and interest of the debt nor the reduction of upward of $7000000 of the capital of the debt itself. The balance in the Treasury on the first of January last was $5201650.43; the receipts from that time to the 30th of September last were $19585932.50; the receipts of the current quarter estimated at $6000000 yield with the sums already received a revenue of about $25500000 for the year; the expenditures for the first three quarters of the year have amounted to $18714226.66; the expenditures of the current quarter are expected including the $2000000 of the principal of the debt to be pa to balance the receipts; so that the expense of the year amounting to upward of $1000000 less than its income will leave a proportionally increased balance in the Treasury on 18270101 over that of the first of January last; instead of $5200000 there will be $6400000.The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the commence of the year 'til September 30 is estimated at $21250000 and the amount that will probably accrue during the present quarter is estimated at $4250000 making for the whole year $25500000 from which the drawbacks being deducted will leave a clear revenue from the customs receivable in the year 1827 of about $20400000 which with the sums to be received from the proceeds of public lands the bank ends and other incental receipts will form an aggregate of about $23000000 a sum falling short of the whole expenses of the present year little more than the portion of those expenditures applied to the discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of $10000000 by the act of 18170303. At the passage of that act the public debt amounted to $123500000. On the first of January next it will be short of $74000000. In the lapse of these 10 years $50000000 of public debt with the annual charge of upward of $3000000 of interest upon them have been extinguished. At the passage of tat act of the annual appropriation of $10000000 $7000000 were absorbed in the payment of interest and not more than $3000000 went to reduce the capital of the debt. Of the same $10000000 at this time scarcely $4000000 are applicable to the interest and upward of $6000000 are effective in melting down the capital.Yet our experience has proved that a revenue consisting so largely of imposts and tonnage ebbs and flows to an extraordinary extent with all the fluctuations incent to the general commerce of the world. It is within our recollection that even in the compass of the same last 10 years the receipts of the Treasury were not adequate to the expenditures of the year and that in two successive years it was found necessary to resort to loans to meet the engagements of the nation. The returning tes of the succeeding years replenished the public coffers until they have again begun to feel the vicissitude of a decline. To produce these alternations of fullness and exhaustion the relative operation of abundant or unfruitful seasons the regulations of foreign governments political revolutions the prosperous or decaying condition of manufactures commercial speculations and many other causes not always to be traced variously combine.We have found the alternate swells and diminutions embracing periods of from two to three years. The last period of depression to United States was from 1819 to 1822. The corresponding revival was from 1823 to the commencement of the present year. Still we have no cause to apprehend a depression comparable to that of the former period or even to anticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to apply the annual $10 million to the reduction of the debt. It is well for us however to be admonished of the necessity of abing by the maxims of the most vigilant economy and of resorting to all honorable and useful expedients for pursuing with steady and inflexible perseverance the total discharge of the debt.Beses the $7000000 of the loans of 1813 which will have been discharged in the course of the present year there are $9000000 which by the terms of the contracts would have been and are now redeemable. $13000000 more of the loan of 1814 will become redeemable from and after the expiration of the present month and $9000000 other from and after the close of the ensuing year. They constitute a mass of $31000000 all bearing an interest of 6 percent more than $20000000 of which will be immediately redeemable and the rest within little more than a year. Leaving of this amount $15000000 to continue at the interest of 6 percent but to be pa off as far as shall be found practicable in the years 1827 and 1828 there is scarcely a doubt that the remaining $16000000 might within a few months be discharged by a loan at not exceeding 5 percent redeemable in the years 1829 and 1830. By this operation a sum of nearly $500000 may be saved to the nation and the discharge of the whole $31000000 within the four years may be greatly facilitated if not wholly accomplished.By an act of Congress of 18350303 a loan for the purpose now referred to or a subscription to stock was authorized at an interest not exceeding 4.5 percent. But at that time so large a portion of the floating capital of the country was absorbed in commercial speculations and so little was left for investment in the stocks that the measure was but partially successful. At the last session of Congress the condition of the funds was still unpropitious to the measure; but the change so soon afterwards occurred that had the authority existed to redeem the $9 million now redeemable by an exchange of stocks or a loan at 5 percent it is morally certain that it might have been effected and with it a yearly saving of $90000.With regard to the collection of the revenue of imposts certain occurrences have within the last year been disclosed in one or two of our principal ports which engaged the attention of Congress at their last session and may hereafter require further conseration. Until within a very few years the execution of the laws for raising the revenue like that of all our other laws has been insured more by the moral sense of the community than by the rigors of a jealous precaution or by penal sanction. Confing in the exemplary punctuality and unsullied integrity of our importing merchants a gradual relaxation from the provisions of the collection laws a close adherence to which have caused inconvenience and expense to them had long become habitual and indulgences had been extended universally because they had never been abused. It may be worthy of your serious conseration whether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come in a of this state of unguarded security.From the reports herewith communicated of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy with the subsiary documents annexed to them will be discovered the present condition and administration of our military establishment on the land and on the sea. The organization of the Army having undergone no change since its reduction to the present peace establishment in 1821 it remains only to observe that it is yet found adequate to all the purposes for which a permanent armed force in time of peace can be needed or useful. It may be proper to add that from a difference of opinion between the late Present of the United States and the Senate with regard to the construction of the act of Congress of 18210302 to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of the U.S. it remains hitherto so far without execution that no colonel has been appointed to command one of the regiments of artillery. A supplementary or explanatory act of the legislature appears to be the only expedient practicable for removing the difficulty of this appointment.In a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military establishment forms but a very inconserable portion of the duties devolving upon the administration of the Department of War. It will be seen by the returns from the subordinate departments of the Army that every branch of the service is marked with order regularity and discipline; that from the commanding general through all the gradations of superintendence the officers feel themselves to have been citizens before they were soldiers and that the glory of a republican army must consist in the spirit of freedom by which it is animated and of patriotism by which it is impelled. It may be confently stated that the moral character of the Army is in a state of continual improvement and that all the arrangements for the disposal of its parts have a constant reference to that end.But to the War Department are attributed other duties having indeed relation to a future possible condition of war but being purely defensive and in their tendency contributing rather to the security and permanency of peace—the erection of the fortifications proved for by Congress and adapted to secure our shores from hostile invasion; the distribution of the fund of public gratitude and justice to the pensioners of the Revolutionary war; the maintenance of our relations of peace and protection with the Indian tribes and the internal improvements and surveys for the location of roads and canals which during the last three sessions of Congress have engaged so much of their attention and may engross so large a share of their future benefactions to our country.By the act of 18240430 suggested and approved by my predecessor the sum of $30000 was appropriated for the purpose of causing to be made the necessary surveys plans and estimates of the routes of such roads and canals as the Present of the United States might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of  or necessary for the transportation of the public mail. The surveys plans and estimates for each when completed will be la before Congress.In execution of this act a board of engineers was immediately instituted and have been since most assuously and constantly occupied in carrying it into effect. The first object to which their labors were directed by order of the late Present was the examination of the country between the te waters of the Potomac the Ohio and Lake Erie to ascertain the practicability of a communication between them to designate the most suitable route for the same and to form plans and estimates in detail of the expense of execution.On 18250203 they made their first report which was immediately communicated to Congress and in which they declared that having maturely conse
ed the circumstances observed by them personally and carefully studied the results of such of the preliminary surveys as were then completed they were decedly of opinion that the communication was practicable.At the last session of Congress before the board of engineers were enabled to make up their second report containing a general plan and preparatory estimate for the work the Committee of the House of Representatives upon Roads and Canals closed the session with a report expressing the hope that the plan and estimate of the board of engineers might at this time be prepared and that the subject be referred to the early and favorable conseration of Congress at their present session. That expected report of the board of engineers is prepared and will forthwith be la before you.Under the resolution of Congress authorizing the Secretary of War to have prepared a complete system of cavalry tactics and a system of exercise and instruction of field artillery for the use of the militia of the U.S. to be reported to Congress at the present session a board of distinguished officers of the Army and of the militia has been convened whose report will be submitted to you with that of the Secretary of War. The occasion was thought favorable for consulting the same board aed by the results of a correspondence with the governors of the several states and territories and other citizens of intelligence and experience upon the acknowledged defective condition of our militia system and of the improvements of which it is susceptible. The report of the board upon this subject is also submitted for your conseration.In the estimates of appropriations for the ensuing year upward of $5 million will be submitted for the expenditures to be pa from the Department of War. Less than two fifths of this will be applicable to the maintenance and support of the Army. $1500000 in the form of pensions goes as a scarcely adequate tribute to the services and sacrifices of a former age and a more than equal sum invested in fortifications or for the preparations of internal improvement proves for the quiet the comfort and happier existence of the ages to come. The appropriations to indemnify those unfortunate remnants of another race unable alike to share in the enjoyments and to exist in the presence of civilization though swelling in recent years to a magnitude burdensome to the Treasury are generally not without their equivalents in profitable value or serve to discharge the Union from engagements more burdensome than debt.In like manner the estimate of appropriations for the Navy Department will present an aggregate sum of upward of $3 million. About half of these however covers the current expenditures of the Navy in actual service and half constitutes a fund of national property the pledge of our future glory and defense. It was scarcely one short year after the close of the late war and when the burden of its expenses and charges was weighing heaviest upon the country that Congress by the act of 18160429 appropriated $1 million annually for eight years to the <emgradual increase of the Navyem. At a subsequent period this annual appropriation was reduced to $0500000 for six years of which the present year is the last. A yet more recent appropriation the last two years for building 10 sloops of war has nearly restored the original appropriation of 1816 of $1 million for every year.The result is before United States all. We have 12 lineofbattle ships 20 frigates and sloops of war in proportion which with a few months preparation may present a line of floating fortifications along the whole range of our coast ready to meet any invader who might attempt to set foot upon our shores. Combining with a system of fortifications upon the shores themselves commenced about the same time under the auspices of my immediate predecessor and hitherto systematically pursued it has placed in our possession the most effective sinews of war and has left us at once an example and a lesson from which our own duties may be inferred.The gradual increase of the Navy was the principle of which the act of 18160429 was the first development. It was the introduction of a system to act upon the character and history of our country for an indefinite series of ages. It was a declaration of that Congress to their constituents and to posterity that it was the destiny and the duty of these confederated states to become in regular process of time and by no petty advances a great al power. That which they proposed to accomplish in eight years is rather to be consered as the measure of their means that the limitation of their design. They looked forward for a term of years sufficient for the accomplishment of a definite portion of their purpose and they left to their successors to fill up the canvas of which they had traced the large and prophetic outline. The ships of the line and frigates which they had in contemplation will be shortly completed. The time which they had allotted for the accomplishment of the work has more than elapsed. It remains for your conseration how their successors may contribute their portion of toil and of treasure for the benefit of the succeeding age in the gradual increase of our Navy.There is perhaps no part of the exercise of the constitutional powers of the federal government which has given more general satisfaction to the people of the Union than this. The system has not been thus vigorously introduced and hitherto sustained to be now departed from or abandoned. In continuing to prove for the gradual increase of the Navy it may not be necessary or expedient to add for the present any more to the number of our ships; but should you deem it advisable to continue the yearly appropriation of $0.5 million to the same objects it may be profitably expended in a proving a supply of timber to be seasoned and other materials for future use in the construction of docks or in laying the foundations of a school for al education as to the wisdom of Congress either of those measures may appear to claim the preference.Of the small portions of this Navy engaged in actual service during the peace squadrons have continued to be maintained in the Pacific Ocean in the West India seas and in the Mediterranean to which has been added a small armament to cruise on the eastern coast of South America. In all they have afforded protection to our commerce have contributed to make our country advantageously known to foreign nations have honorably employed multitudes of our sea men in the service of their country and have inured numbers of youths of the rising generation to lives of manly hardihood and of nautical experience and skill.The piracies with which the West India seas were for several years infested have been totally suppressed but in the Mediterranean they have increased in a manner afflictive to other nations and but for the continued presence of our squadron would probably have been distressing to our own.The war which has unfortunately broken out between the republic of Buenos Aires and the Brazilian government has given rise to very great irregularities among the al officers of the latter by whom principles in relation to ades and to neutral igation have been brought forward to which we can not subscribe and which our own commanders have found it necessary to resist. From the friendly disposition toward the United States constantly manifested by the Emperor of Brazil and the very useful and friendly commercial intercourse between the United States and his dominions we have reason to believe that the just reparation demanded for the injuries sustained by several of our citizens from some of his officers will not be withheld. Abstracts from the recent dispatches of the commanders of our several squadrons are communicated with the report of the Secretary of the Navy to Congress.A report from the Postmaster General is likewise communicated presenting in a highly satisfactory manner the result of a vigorous efficient and economical administration of that department. The revenue of the office even of the year including the latter half of 1824 and the first half of 1825 had exceeded its expenditures by a sum of more than $45000. That of the succeeding year has been still more productive. The increase of the receipts in the year preceding the first of July last over that of the year before exceeds $136000 and the excess of the receipts over the expenditures of the year has swollen from $45000 to yearly $80000.During the same period contracts for additional transportation of the mail in stages for about 260000 miles have been made and for 70000 miles annually on horse back. 714 new post offices have been established within the year and the increase of revenue within the last three years as well as the augmentation of the transportation by mail is more than equal to the whole amount of receipts and of mail conveyance at the commencement of the present century when the seat of the general government was removed to this place. When we reflect that the objects effected by the transportation of the mail are among the choicest comforts and enjoyments of social life it is pleasing to observe that the dissemination of them to every corner of our country has outstripped in their increase even the rap march of our population.By the treaties with France and Spain respectively ceding Louisiana and the Floras to the United States provision was made for the security of land titles derived from the governments of those nations. Some progress has been made under the authority of various acts of Congress in the ascertainment and establishment of those titles but claims to a very large extent remain unadjusted. The public faith no less than the just rights of inuals and the interest of the community itself appears to require further provision for the speedy settlement of those claims which I therefore recommend to the care and attention of the Legislature.In conformity with the provisions of the act of 18250520 to prove for erecting a penitentiary in the District of Columbia and for other purposes three commissioners were appointed to select a site for the erection of a penitentiary for the District and also a site in the county of Alexandria for a county jail both of which objects have been effected. The building of the penitentiary has been commenced and is in such a degree of forwardness as to promise that it will be completed before the meeting of the next Congress. This conseration points to the expediency of maturing at the present session a system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary and of defining a system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary and of defining the  of offenses which shall be punishable by confinement in this edifice.In closing this communication I trust that it will not be deemed inappropriate to the occasion and purposes upon which we are here assembled to indulge a momentary retrospect combining in a single glance the period of our origin as a national confederation with that of our present existence at the precise interval of half a century from each other. Since your last meeting at this place the 50th anniversary of the day when our independence was declared has been celebrated throughout our land and on that day while every heart was bounding with joy and every voice was tuned to gratulation am the blessings of freedom and independence which the sires of a former age had handed down to their children two of the principal actors in that solemn scene—the hand that penned the ever memorable Declaration and the voice that sustained it in debate—were by one summons at the distance of 700 miles from each other called before the Judge of All to account for their deeds done upon earth. They departed cheered by the benedictions of their country to whom they left the inheritance of their fame and the memory of their bright example.If we turn our thoughts to the condition of their country in the contrast of the first and last day of that half century how resplendent and sublime is the transition from gloom to glory! Then glancing through the same lapse of time in the condition of the inuals we see the first day marked with the fullness and vigor of youth in the pledge of their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to the cause of freedom and of mankind; and on the last extended on the bed of death with but sense and sensibility left to breathe a last aspiration to Heaven of blessing upon their country may we not humbly hope that to them too it was a pledge of transition from gloom to glory and that while their mortal vestments were sinking into the clod of the valley their emancipated spirits were ascending to the bosom of their God! 
Fellow citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:At no period of our political existence had we so much cause to felicitate ourselves at the prosperous and happy condition of our country. The abundant fruits of the earth have filled it with plenty. An extensive and profitable commerce has greatly augmented our revenue. The public credit has attained an extraordinary elevation. Our preparations for defense in case of future wars from which by the experience of all nations we ought not to expect to be exempted are advancing under a welldigested system with all the dispatch which so important a work will admit. Our free government founded on the interest and affections of the people has gained and is daily gaining strength. Local jealousies are raply yielding to more generous enlarged and enlightened s of national policy. For advantages so numerous and highly important it is our duty to unite in grateful acknowledgements to that Omnipotent Being from whom they are derived and in unceasing prayer that will endow us with virtue and strength to maintain and hand them down in their utmost purity to our latest posterity.I have the satisfaction to inform you that an arrangement which had been commenced by my predecessor with the British government for the reduction of the al force by Great Britain and the United States on the lakes has been concluded by which it is proved that neither party shall keep in service on Lake Champlain more than one vessel on Lake Ontario more than one and on Lake Erie and the upper lakes more than two to be armed each with one cannon only and that all the other armed vessels of both parties of which an exact list is interchanged shall be dismantled. It is also agreed that the force retained shall be restricted in its duty to the internal purposes of each party and that the arrangement shall remain in force until six months shall have expired after notice given by one of the parties to the other of its desire that it should terminate. By this arrangement useless expense on both ses and what is of still greater importance the danger of collision between armed vessels in those inland waters which was great is prevented.I have the satisfaction also to state that the commissioners under the fourth article of the Treaty of Ghent to whom it was referred to dece to which party the several islands in the bay of Passamaquoddy belonged under the treaty of 1783 have agreed in a report by which all the islands in the possession of each party before the late war have been decreed to it. The commissioners acting under the other articles of the Treaty of Ghent for the settlement of boundaries have also been engaged in the discharge of their respective duties but have not yet completed them.The difference which arose between the two governments under that treaty respecting the right of the U.S. to take and cure fish on the coast of the British provinces north of our limits which had been secured by the treaty of 1783 is still in negotiation. The proposition made by this government to extend to the colonies of GB the principle of the convention of London by which the commerce between the ports of the United States and British ports in Europe had been placed on a footing of equality has been declined by the British government. This subject having been thus amicably discussed between the two governments and it appearing that the British government is unwilling to depart from its present regulations it remains for Congress to dece whether they will make any other regulations in consequence thereof for the protection and improvement of our igation.The negotiation with Spain for spoliations on our commerce and the settlement of boundaries remains essentially in the state it held by the communications that were made to Congress by my predecessor. It has been evently the policy of the Spanish government to keep the negotiation suspended and in this the United States have acquiesced from an amicable disposition toward Spain and in the expectation that her government would from a sense of justice finally accede to such an arrangement as would be equal between the parties. A disposition has been lately shown by the Spanish government to move in the negotiation which has been met by this government and should the conciliatory and friendly policy which has invariably gued our councils be reciprocated a just and satisfactory arrangement may be expected. It is proper however to remark that no proposition has yet been made from which such a result can be presumed.It was anticipated at an early stage that the contest between Spain and the colonies would become highly interesting to the United States. It was natural that our citizens should sympathize in events which affected their neighbors. It seemed probable also that the prosecution of the conflict along our coast and in contiguous countries would occasionally interrupt our commerce and otherwise affect the persons and property of our citizens. These anticipations have been realized. Such injuries have been received from persons acting under authority of both the parties and for which redress has in most instances been withheld.Through every stage of the conflict the United States have maintained an impartial neutrality giving a to neither of the parties in men money ships or munitions of war. They have regarded the contest not in the light of an ordinary insurrection or rebellion but as a civil war between parties nearly equal having as to neutral powers equal rights. Our ports have been open to both and every article the fruit of our soil or of the industry of our citizens which either was permitted to take has been equally free to the other. Should the colonies establish their independence it is proper now to state that this government neither seeks nor would accept from them any advantage in commerce or otherwise which will not be equally open to all other nations. The colonies will in that event become independent states free from any obligation to or connection with us which it may not then be their interest to form on the basis of a fair reciprocity.In the summer of the present year an expedition was set on foot against East Flora by persons claiming to act under the authority of some of the colonies who took possession of Amelia Island at the mouth of the St. Marys River near the boundary of the State of Georgia. As this Province lies eastward of the Mississippi and is bounded by the United States and the ocean on every se and has been a subject of negotiation with the government of Spain as an indemnity for losses by spoliation or in exchange for territory of equal value westward of the Mississippi a fact well known to the world it excited surprise that any countenance should be given to this measure by any of the colonies.As it would be difficult to reconcile it with the friendly relations existing between the United States and the colonies a doubt was entertained whether it had been authorized by them or any of them. This doubt has gained strength by the circumstances which have unfolded themselves in the prosecution of the enterprise which have marked it as a mere private unauthorized adventure. Projected and commenced with an incompetent force reliance seems to have been placed on what might be drawn in defiance of our laws from within our limits; and of late as their resources have failed it has assumed a more marked character of unfriendliness to us the island being made a channel for the illicit introduction of slaves from Africa into the United States an asylum for fugitive slaves from the neighboring states and a port for smuggling of every kind.A similar establishment was made at an earlier period by persons of the same description in the Gulf of Mexico at a place called Galvezton within the limits of the United States as we contend under the cession of Louisiana. This enterprise has been marked in a more signal manner by all the objectionable circumstances which characterized the other and more particularly by the equipment of privateers which have annoyed our commerce and by smuggling. These establishments if ever sanctioned by any authority whatever which is not believed have abused their trust and forfeited all claim to conseration. A just regard for the rights and interests of the United States required that they should be suppressed and orders have been accordingly issued to that effect. The imperious conserations which produced this measure will be explained to the parties whom it may in any degree concern.To obtain correct information on every subject in which the United States are interested; to inspire just sentiments in all persons in authority on either se of our friendly disposition so far as it may comport with an impartial neutrality and to secure proper respect to our commerce in every port and from every flag it has been thought proper to send a ship of war with three distinguished citizens along the southern coast with these purpose. With the existing authorities with those in the possession of and exercising the sovereignty must the communication be held; from them alone can redress for past injuries committed by persons acting under them be obtained; by them alone can the commission of the like in future be prevented.Our relations with the other powers of Europe have experienced no essential change since the last session. In our intercourse with each due attention continues to be pa to the protection of our commerce and to every other object in which the United States are interested. A strong hope is entertained that by adhering to the maxims of a just a cand and friendly policy we may long preserve amicable relations with all the powers of Europe on conditions advantageous and honorable to our country.With the Barbary states and the Indian tribes our pacific relations have been preserved.In calling your attention to the internal concerns of our country the  which they exhibit is peculiarly gratifying. The payments which have been made into the Treasury show the very productive state of the public revenue. After satisfying the appropriations made by law for the support of the civil government and of the military and al establishments embracing suitable provision for fortifications and for the gradual increase of the Navy paying the interest of the public debt and extinguishing more than $18 million of the principal within the present year it is estimated that a balance of more than $6 million will remain in the Treasury on the first day of January applicable to the current service of the ensuing year.The payments into the Treasury during the year 1818 on account of imposts and tonnage resulting principally from duties which have accrued in the present year may be fairly estimated at $20 million; the internal revenues at $2.5 million; the public lands at $1.5 million; bank ends and incental receipts at $500000; making in the whole $24.5 million.The annual permanent expenditure for the support of the civil government and of the Army and Navy as now established by law amounts to $11.8 million and for the sinking fund to $10 million making in the whole $21.8 million leaving an annual excess of revenue beyond the expenditure of $2.7 million exclusive of the balance estimated to be in the Treasury on the first day of January 1818.In the present state of the Treasury the whole of the Louisiana debt may be redeemed in the year 1819 after which if the public debt continues as it now is above par there will be annually about $5 million of the sinking fund unexpended until the year 1825 when the loan of 1812 and the stock created by funding Treasury notes will be redeemable.It is also estimated that the Mississippi stock will be discharged during the year 1819 from the proceeds of the public lands assigned to that object after which the receipts from those lands will annually add to the public revenue the sum of $1.5 million making the permanent annual revenue amount to $26 million and leaving an annual excess of revenue after the year 1819 beyond the permanent authorized expenditure of more than $4 million.By the last returns to the Department of War the militia force of the several states may be estimated at 800000 men—infantry artillery and cavalry. Great part of this force is armed and measures are taken to arm the whole. An improvement in the organization and discipline of the militia is one of the great objects which claims the unremitted attention of Congress.The regular force amounts nearly to the number required by law and is stationed along the Atlantic and inland frontiers.Of the al force it has been necessary to maintain strong squadrons in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico.From several of the Indian tribes inhabiting the country bordering on Lake Erie purchases have been made of lands on conditions very favorable to the United States and as it is presumed not less so to the tribes themselves.By these purchases the Indian title with moderate reservations has been extinguished to the whole of the land within the limits of the state of Ohio and to a part of that in the Michigan Territory and of the state of Indiana. From the Cherokee tribe a tract has been purchased in the state of Georgia and an arrangement made by which in exchange for lands beyond the Mississippi a great part if not the whole of the land belonging to that tribe eastward of that river in the states of North Carolina Georgia and Tennessee and in the Alabama Territory will soon be acquired. By these acquisitions and others that may reasonably be expected soon to follow we shall be enabled to extend our settlements from the inhabited parts of the state of Ohio along Lake Erie into the Michigan Territory and to connect our settlements by degrees through the state of Indiana and the Illinois Territory to that of Missouri. A similar and equally advantageous effect will soon be produced to the south through the whole extent of the states and territory which border on the waters emptying into the Mississippi and the Mobile.In this progress which the rights of nature demand and nothing can prevent marking a growth rap and gigantic it is our duty to make new efforts for the preservation improvement and civilization of the native inhabitants. The hunter state can exist only in the vast uncultivated desert. It yields to the more dense and compact form and greater force of civilized population; and of right it ought to yield for the earth was given to mankind to support the greatest number of which it is capable and no tribe or people have a right to withhold from the wants of others more than is necessary for their own support and comfort.It is gratifying to know that the reservations of land made by the treaties with the tribes on Lake Erie were made with a  to inual ownership among them and to the cultivation of the soil by all and that an annual stipend has been pledged to supply their other wants. It will merit the conseration of Congress whether other provision not stipulated by treaty ought to be made for these tribes and for the advancement of the liberal and humane policy of the United States toward all the tribes within our limits and more particularly for their improvement in the arts of civilized life.Among the advantages incent to these purchases and to those which have preceded the security which may thereby be afforded to our inland frontiers is peculiarly important. With a strong barrier consisting of our own people thus planted on the Lakes the Mississippi and the Mobile with the protection to be derived from the regular force Indian hostilities if they do not altogether cease will henceforth lose their terror. Fortifications in those quarters to any extent will not be necessary and the expense of attending them may be saved. A people accustomed to the use of firearms only as the Indian tribes are will shun even moderate works which are defended by cannon. Great fortifications will therefore be requisite only in future along the coast and at some points in the interior connected with it. On these will the safety of our towns and the commerce of our great rivers from the Bay of Fundy to the Mississippi depend. On these therefore should the utmost attention skill and labor be bestowed.A conserable and rap augmentation in the value of all the public lands proceeding from these and other obvious cases may henceforward be expected. The difficulties attending early emigrations will be dissipated even in the most remote parts. Several new states have been admitted into our Union to the west and south and territorial governments happily organized established over every other portion in which there is vacant land for sale. In terminating Indian hostilities as must soon be done in a formable shape at least the emigration which has heretofore been great will probably increase and the demand for land and the augmentation in its value be in like proportion.The great increase of our population throughout the union will alone produce an important effect and in no quarter will it be so sensibly felt as in those in contemplation. The public lands are a public stock which ought to be disposed of to the best advantage for the nation. The nation should therefore derive the profit proceeding from the continual rise in their value. Every encouragement should be given to the emigrants consistent with a fair competition between them but that competition should operate in the first sale to the advantage of the nation rather than of inuals.Great capitalists will derive the benefit incent to their superior wealth under any mode of sale which may be adopted but if looking forward to the rise in the value of the public lands they should have the opportunity of amassing at a low price vast bodies in their hands the profit will accrue to them and not to the public. They would also have the power in that degree to control the emigration and settlement in such a manner as their opinion of their respective interests might dictate. I submit this subject to the conseration of Congress that such further provision may be made in the sale of the public lands with a  to the public interest should any be deemed expedient as in their judgment may be best adapted to the object.When we conser the vast extent of territory within the United States the great amount and value of its productions the connection of its parts and other circumstances on which their prosperity and happiness depend we can not fail to entertain a high sense of the advantage to be derived from the facility which may be afforded in the intercourse between them by means of good roads and canals. Never d a country of such vast extent offer equal inducements to improvements of this kind nor ever were consequences of such magnitude involved in them. As this subject was acted on by Congress at the last session and there may be a disposition to revive it at the present I have brought it into  for the purpose of communicating my sentiments on a very important circumstance connected with it with that freedom and candor which a regard for the public interest and a proper respect for Congress require.A difference of opinion has existed from the first formation of our Constitution to the present time among our most enlightened and virtuous citizens respecting the right of Congress to establish such a system of improvement. Taking into  the trust with which I am now honored it would be improper after what has passed that this discussion should be revived with an uncertainty of my opinion respecting the right. Disregarding early impressions I have bestowed on the subject all the deliberation which its great importance and a just sense of my duty required and the result is a settled conviction in my mind that Congress do not possess the right. It is not contained in any of the specified powers granted to Congress nor can I conser it incental to or a necessary means ed on the most liberal scale for carrying into effect any of the powers which are specifically granted.In communicating this result I can not resist the obligation which I feel to suggest to Congress the propriety of recommending to the states the adoption of an amendment to the Constitution which shall give to Congress the right in question. In cases of doubtful construction especially of such vital interest it comports with the nature and origin of our institutions and will contribute much to preserve them to apply to our constituents for an explicit grant of the power. We may confently rely that if it appears to their satisfaction that the power is necessary it will always be granted.In this case I am happy to observe that experience has afforded the most ample proof of its utility and that the benign spirit of conciliation and harmony which now manifests itself throughout our Union promises to such a recommendation the most prompt and favorable result. I think proper to suggest also in case this measure is adopted that it be recommended to the states to include in the amendment sought a right in Congress to institute likewise seminaries of learning for the allimportant purpose of diffusing knowledge among our fellow citizens throughout the United States.Our manufactories will require the continued attention of Congress. The capital employed in them is conserable and the knowledge acquired in the machinery and fabric of all the most useful manufactures is of great value. Their preservation which depends on due encouragement is connected with the high interests of the nation.Although the progress of the public buildings has been as favorable as circumstances have permitted it is to be regretted that the Capitol is not yet in a state to receive you. There is good cause to presume that the two wings the only parts as yet commenced will be prepared for that purpose at the next session. The time seems now to have arrived when this subject may be deemed worthy the attention of Congress on a scale adequate to national purposes. The completion of the mdle building will be necessary to the convenient accommodation of Congress of the committees and various offices belonging to it.It is event that the other public buildings are altogether insufficient for the accommodation of the several executive departments some of whom are much crowded and even subjected to the necessity of obtaining it in private buildings at some distance from the head of the department and with inconvenience to the management of the public business.Most nations have taken an interest and a pre in the improvement and ornament of their metropolis and none were more conspicuous in that respect than the ancient republics. The policy which dictated the establishment of a permanent resence for the national government and the spirit in which it was commenced and has been prosecuted show that such improvement was thought worthy the attention of this nation. Its central position between the northern and southern extremes of our union and its approach to the west at the head of a great igable river which interlocks with the Western waters prove the wisdom of the councils which established it.Nothing appears to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient accommodation should be proved on a welldigested plan for the heads of the several departments and for the Attorney General and it is believed that the public ground in the city applied to these objects will be found amply sufficient. I submit this subject to the conseration of Congress that such further provision may be made in it as to them may seem proper.It is contemplating the happy situation of the United States our attention is drawn with peculiar interest to the surviving officers and soldiers of our Revolutionary army who so eminently contributed by their services to lay its foundation. Most of those very meritorious citizens have pa the debt of nature and gone to repose. It is believed that among the survivors there are some not proved for by existing laws who are reduced to indigence and even to real distress. These man have a claim on the gratitude of their country and it will do honor to their country to prove for them. The lapse of a few years more and the opportunity will be forever lost; indeed so long already has been the interval that the number to be benefitted by any provision which may be made will not be great.It appearing in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arising from imposts and tonnage and from the sale of the public lands will be fully adequate to the support of the civil government of the present military and al establishments including the annual augmentation of the latter to the extent proved for to the payment of the interest of the public debt and to the extinguishment of it at the times authorized without the a of the internal taxes I conser it my duty to recommend to Congress their repeal.To impose taxes when the public exigencies require them is an obligation of the most sacred character especially with a free people. The faithful fulfillment of it is among the highest proofs of their value and capacity for selfgovernment. To dispense with taxes when it may be done with perfect safety is equally the duty of their representatives.In this instance we have the satisfaction to know that they were imposed when the demand was imperious and have been sustained with exemplary felity. I have to add that however gratifying it may be to me regarding the prosperous and happy condition of our country to recommend the repeal of these taxes at this time I shall nevertheless be attentive to events and should any future emergency occur be not less prompt to suggest such measures and burdens as may then be requisite and proper. 
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:  It would have given me fellow citizens great satisfaction to announce in the moment of your meeting that the difficulties in our foreign relations existing at the time of your last separation had been amicably and justly terminated. I lost no time in taking those measures which were most likely to bring them to such a termination by special missions charged with such powers and instructions as in the event of failure could leave no imputation on either our moderation or forbearance. The delays which have since taken place in our negotiations with the British government appears to have proceeded from causes which do not forb the expectation that during the course of the session I may be enabled to lay before you their final issue. What will be that of the negotiations for settling our differences with Spain nothing which had taken place at the date of the last despatches enables us to pronounce. On the western se of the Mississippi she advanced in conserable force and took post at the settlement of Bayou Pierre on the Red river. This village was originally settled by France was held by her as long as she held Louisiana and was delivered to Spain only as a part of Louisiana. Being small insulated and distant it was not observed at the moment of redelivery to France and the United States that she continued a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed there. A proposition however having been lately made by our commanderinchief to assume the Sabine river as a temporary line of separation between the troops of the two nations until the issue of our negotiations shall be known; this has been referred by the Spanish commandant to his superior and in the meantime he has withdrawn his force to the western se of the Sabine river. The correspondence on this subject now communicated will exhibit more particularly the present state of things in that quarter. The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted infantry. In order therefore that the commanding officer might be enabled to act with effect I had authorized him to call on the governors of Orleans and Mississippi for a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry. The temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary. But I inform you with great pleasure of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of those territories have tendered their services in defence of their country. It has done honor to themselves entitled them to the confence of their fellowcitizens in every part of the Union and must strengthen the general determination to protect them efficaciously under all circumstances which may occur.Having received information that in another part of the United States a great number of private inuals were combining together arming and organizing themselves contrary to law to carry on military expeditions against the territories of Spain I thought it necessary by proclamations as well as by special orders to take measures for preventing and suppressing this enterprise for seizing the vessels arms and other means proved for it and for arresting and bringing to justice its authors and abettors. It was due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transactions; it was due to good order and regular government that while the public force was acting strictly on the defensive and merely to protect our citizens from aggression the criminal attempts of private inuals to dece for their country the question of peace or war by commencing active and unauthorized hostilities should be promptly and efficaciously suppressed.Whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will depend on the result of our negotiation with Spain; but as it is uncertain when that result will be known the provisional measures requisite for that and to meet any pressure intervening in that quarter will be a subject for your early conseration.The possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a single point the defence of that river its waters and the country adjacent it becomes highly necessary to prove for that point a more adequate security. Some position above its mouth commanding the passage of the river should be rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessels which may be stationed there for defence and in conjunction with them to present an insuperable obstacle to any force attempting to pass. The approaches to the city of New Orleans from the eastern quarter also will require to be examined and more effectually guarded. For the internal support of the country the encouragement of a strong settlement on the western se of the Mississippi within reach of New Orleans will be worthy the conseration of the legislature.The gunboats authorized by an act of the last session are so advanced that they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances permitted us to allow the time necessary for their more sol construction. As a much larger number will still be wanting to place our seaport towns and waters in that state of defence to which we are competent and they entitled a similar appropriation for a further provision for them is recommended for the ensuing year.A further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications already established and the erection of such works as may have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our seaport towns or their remaining before them.In a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people directly expressed by their free suffrages; where the principal executive aries and those of the legislature are renewed by them at short periods; where under the characters of jurors they exercise in person the greatest portion of the judiciary powers; where the laws are consequently so formed and administered as to bear with equal weight and favor on all restraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry and securing to every one the property which that acquires it would not be supposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection or enterprise on the public peace or authority. The laws however aware that these should not be trusted to moral restraints only have wisely proved punishments for these crimes when committed. But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission? Where an enterprise is meditated by private inuals against a foreign nation in amity with the United States powers of prevention to a certain extent are given by the laws; would they not be as reasonable and useful were the enterprise preparing against the United States? While adverting to this branch of the law it is proper to observe that in enterprises meditated against foreign nations the ordinary process of binding to the observance of the peace and good behavior could it be extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the United States would be effectual in some cases where the offender is able to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on him the exercise of the powers now given by law.The states on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to respect our peace and friendship; with Tunis alone some uncertainty remains. Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on equal terms or not at all I propose to send in due time a reinforcement into the Mediterranean unless previous information shall show it to be unnecessary.We continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian neighbors and of their disposition to place all their interests under the patronage of the United States. These dispositions are inspired by their confence in our justice and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare; and as long as we discharge these high and honorable s with the integrity and good faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance we may expect to reap the just reward in their peace and friendship.The expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke for exploring the river Missouri and the best communication from that to the Pacific ocean has had all the success which could have been expected. They have traced the Missouri nearly to its source descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across our continent learned the character of the country of its commerce and inhabitants; and it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis and Clarke and their brave companions have by this arduous service deserved well of their country.The attempt to explore the Red river under the direction of Mr. Freeman though conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation has not been equally successful. After proceeding up it about six hundred miles nearly as far as the French settlements had extended while the country was in their possession our geographers were obliged to return without completing their work.Very useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the Mississippi by Lieutenant Pike who has ascended to its source and whose journal and map giving the details of the journey will shortly be ready for communication to both houses of Congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke and Freeman will require further time to be digested and prepared. These important surveys in addition to those before possessed furnish materials for commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi and its western waters. Some principal rivers however remain still to be explored toward which the authorization of Congress by moderate appropriations will be requisite.I congratulate you fellowcitizens on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa and which the morality the reputation and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent by timely notice expeditions which cannot be completed before that day.The receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last have amounted to near fifteen millions of dollars which have enabled us after meeting the current demands to pay two millions seven hundred thousand dollars of the American claims in part of the price of Louisiana; to pay of the funded debt upward of three millions of principal and nearly four of interest; and in addition to reimburse in the course of the present month near two millions of five and a half per cent. stock. These payments and reimbursements of the funded debt with those which have been made in the four years and a half preceding will at the close of the present year have extinguished upwards of twentythree millions of principal.The duties composing the Mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of the present season. Consering however that they are levied chiefly on luxuries and that we have an impost on salt a necessary of life the free use of which otherwise is so important I recommend to your conseration the suppression of the duties on salt and the continuation of the Mediterranean fund instead thereof for a short time after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation.When both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be relinquished there will still ere long be an accumulation of moneys in the treasury beyond the instalments of public debt which we are permitted by contract to pay. They cannot then without a modification assented to by the public creditors be applied to the extinguishment of this debt and the complete liberation of our revenues  the most desirable of all objects; nor if our peace continues will they be wanting for any other existing purpose. The question therefore now comes forward  to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them? Shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures? On a few articles of more general and necessary use the suppression in due season will doubtless be right but the great mass of the articles on which impost is pa is foreign luxuries purchased by those only who are rich enough to afford themselves the use of them. Their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers. By these operations new channels of communication will be opened between the States; the lines of separation will disappear their interests will be entified and their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Education is here placed among the articles of public care not that it would be proposed to take its ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprise which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal; but a public institution can alone supply those sciences which though rarely called for are yet necessary to complete the circle all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the country and some of them to its preservation. The subject is now proposed for the conseration of Congress because if approved by the time the State legislatures shall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts and the laws shall be passed and other arrangements made for their execution the necessary funds will be on hand and without employment. I suppose an amendment to the constitution by consent of the States necessary because the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution and to which it permits the public moneys to be applied.The present conseration of a national establishment for education particularly is rendered proper by this circumstance also that if Congress approving the proposition shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the advantage of being independent on war which may suspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes the resources destined for them.This fellow citizens is the state of the public interest at the present moment and according to the information now possessed. But such is the situation of the nations of Europe and such too the predicament in which we stand with some of them that we cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affairs that may change from moment to moment during the course of your session or after you shall have separated. Our duty is therefore to act upon things as they are and to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be. Were armies to be raised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon we never should have been without them. Our resources would have been exhausted on dangers which have never happened instead of being reserved for what is really to take place. A steady perhaps a quickened pace in preparations for the defence of our seaport towns and waters; an early settlement of the most exposed and vulnerable parts of our country; a militia so organized that its effective portions can be called to any point in the Union or volunteers instead of them to serve a sufficient time are means which may always be ready yet never preying on our resources until actually called into use. They will maintain the public interests while a more permanent force shall be in course of preparation. But much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be brought into activity. If war be forced upon us in spite of our long and vain appeals to the justice of nations rap and vigorous movements in its outset will go far toward securing us in its course and issue and toward throwing its burdens on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force.The result of our negotiations or such incents in their course as may enable us to infer their probable issue; such further movements also on our western frontiers as may show whether war is to be pressed there while negotiation is protracted elsewhere shall be communicated to you from time to time as they become known to me with whatever other information I possess or may receive which may a your deliberations on the great national interests committed to your charge. 
Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:The  which I have now to present to you of our affairs foreign and domestic realizes the most sanguine anticipations which have been entertained of the public prosperity. If we look to the whole our growth as a nation continues to be rap beyond example; if to the states which compose it the same gratifying spectacle is exhibited. Our expansion over the vast territory within our limits has been great without indicating any decline in those sections from which the emigration has been most conspicuous. We have daily gained strength by a native population in every quarter—a population devoted to our happy system of government and cherishing the bond of union with internal affection.Experience has already shewn that the difference of climate and of industry proceeding from that cause inseparable from such vast domains and which under other systems might have a repulsive tendency can not fail to produce with us under wise regulations the opposite effect. What one portion wants the other may supply; and this will be most sensibly felt by the parts most distant from each other forming thereby a domestic market and an active intercourse between the extremes and throughout every portion of our Union.Thus by a happy distribution of power between the national and state governments governments which rest exclusively on the sovereignty of the people and are fully adequate to the great purposes for which they were respectively instituted causes which might otherwise lead to dismemberment operate powerfully to draw us closer together.In every other circumstance a correct  of the actual state of our union must be equally gratifying to our constituents.Our relations with foreign powers are of a friendly character although certain interesting differences remain unsettled with some. Our revenue under the mild system of impost and tonnage continues to be adequate to all the purposes of the government. Our agriculture commerce manufactures and igation flourish. Our fortifications are advancing in the degree authorized by existing appropriations to maturity and due progress is made in the augmentation of the Navy to the limit prescribed for it by law. For these blessings we owe to Almighty God from whom we derive them and with profound reverence our most grateful and unceasing acknowledgments. In adverting to our relations with foreign powers which are always an object of the highest importance I have to remark that of the subjects which have been brought into discussion with them during the present administration some have been satisfactorily terminated others have been suspended to be resumed hereafter under circumstances more favorable to success and others are still in negotiation with the hope that they may be adjusted with mutual accommodation to the interests and to the satisfaction of the respective parties. It has been the invariable object of this government to cherish the most friendly relations with every power and on principles and conditions which might make them permanent. A systematic effort has been made to place our commerce with each power on a footing of perfect reciprocity to settle with each in a spirit of candor and liberality all existing differences and to anticipate and remove so far as it might be practicable all causes of future variance.It having been stipulated by the seventh article of the convention of igation and commerce which was concluded on [18220624] between the United States and France that the sa convention should continue in force for two years from the first of October of that year and for an indefinite term afterwards unless one of the parties should declare its intention to renounce it in which event it should cease to operate at the end of six months from such declaration and no such intention having been announced the convention having been found advantageous to both parties it has since remained and still remains in force.At the time when that convention was concluded many interesting subjects were left unsettled and particularly our claim to indemnity for spoliations which were committed on our commerce in the late wars. For these interests and claims it was in the contemplation of the parties to make provision at a subsequent day by a more comprehensive and definitive treaty. The object has been duly attended to since by the executive but as yet it has not been accomplished.It is hoped that a favorable opportunity will present itself for opening a negotiation which may embrace and arrange all existing differences and every other concern in which they have a common interest upon the accession of the present King of France an event which has occurred since the close of the last session of Congress.With Great Britain our commercial intercourse rests on the same footing that it d at the last session. by the convention of 1815 the commerce between the United States and the British dominions in Europe and the East Indies was arranged on a principle of reciprocity. That convention was confirmed and continued in force with slight exceptions by a subsequent treaty for the term of 10 years from [18181020] the date of the latter.The trade with the British colonies in the West Indies has not as yet been arranged by treaty or otherwise to our satisfaction. An approach to that result has been made by legislative acts whereby many serious impediments which had been raised by the parties in defense of their respective claims were removed. An earnest desire exists and has been manifested on the part of this government to place the commerce with the colonies likewise on a footing of reciprocal advantage and it is hoped that the British government seeing the justice of the proposal and its importance to the colonies will ere long accede to it.The commissioners who were appointed for the adjustment of the boundary between the territories of the United States and those of Great Britain specified in the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent having disagreed in their decision and both governments having agreed to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation between them it is hoped that it may be satisfactorily adjusted in that mode. The boundary specified by the sixth article has been established by the decision of the commissioners. From the progress made in that proved for by the seventh according to a report recently received there is good cause to presume that it will be settled in the course of the ensuing year.It is a cause of serious regret that no arrangement has yet been finally concluded between the two governments to secure by joint cooperation the suppression of the slave trade. It was the object of the British government in the early stages of the negotiation to adopt a plan for the suppression which should include the concession of the mutual right of search by the ships of war of each party of the vessels of the other for suspected offenders. This was objected to by this government on the principle that as the right of search was a right of war of a belligerent toward a neutral power it might have an ill effect to extend it by treaty to an offense which had been made comparatively mild to a time of peace.Anxious however for the suppression of this trade it was thought advisable in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives founded on an act of Congress to propose to the British government an expedient which should be free from that objection and more effectual for the object by making it piratical. In that mode the enormity of the crime would place the offenders out of the protection of their government and involve no question of search or other question between the parties touching their respective rights. It was believed also that it would completely suppress the trade in the vessels of both parties and by their respective citizens and subjects in those of other powers with whom it was hoped that the odium which would thereby be attached to it would produce a corresponding arrangement and by means thereof its entire extirpation forever.A convention to this effect was concluded and signed in London on [18240313] by plenipotentiaries duly authorized by both governments to the ratification of which certain obstacles have arisen which are not yet entirely removed. The difference between the parties still remaining has been reduced to a point not of sufficient magnitude as is presumed to be permitted to defeat an object so near to the heart of both nations and so desirable to the friends of humanity throughout the world. As objections however to the principle recommended by the House of Representatives or at least to the consequences inseparable from it and which are understood to apply to the law have been raised which may deserve a reconseration of the whole subject I have thought it proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the definitive sentiments of Congress may be ascertained. The documents relating to the negotiation are with that intent submitted to your conseration.Our commerce with Sweden has been placed on a footing of perfect reciprocity by treaty and with Russia the Netherlands Prussia the free Hanseatic cities the Dukedom of Oldenburg and Sardinia by internal regulations on each se founded on mutual agreement between the respective governments.The principles upon which the commercial policy of the United States is founded are to be traced to an early period. They are essentially connected with those upon which their independence was declared and owe their origin to the enlightened men who took the lead in our affairs at that important epoch. They are developed in their first treaty of commerce with France of [17780206] and by a formal commission which was instituted immediately after the conclusion of their Revolutionary struggle for the purpose of negotiating treaties of commerce with every European power. The first treaty of the United States with Prussia which was negotiated by that commission affords a signal illustration of those principles. The act of Congress of [18150303] adopted immediately after the return of a general peace was a new overture to foreign nations to establish our commercial relations with them on the basis of free and equal reciprocity. That principle has pervaded all the acts of Congress and all the negotiations of the executive on the subject.A convention for the settlement of important questions in relation to the North West coast of this continent and its adjoining seas was concluded and signed at St. Petersburg on the 5th day of April last by the minister plenipotentiary of the United States and plenipotentiaries of the Imperial government of Russia. It will immediately be la before the Senate for the exercise of the constitutional authority of that body with reference to its ratification. It is proper to add that the manner in which this negotiation was invited and conducted on the part of the Emperor has been very satisfactory.The great and extraordinary changes which have happened in the governments of Spain and Portugal within the last two years without seriously affecting the friendly relations which under all of them have been maintained with those powers by the United States have been obstacles to the adjustment of the particular subjects of discussion which have arisen with each. A resolution of the Senate adopted at their last session called for information as to the effect produced upon our relations with Spain by the recognition on the part of the United States of the independent South American governments. The papers containing that information are now communicated to Congress.A charge' d'affaires has been received from the independent government of Brazil. That country heretofore a colonial possession of Portugal had some years since been proclaimed by the Sovereign of Portugal himself an independent Kingdom. Since his return to Lisbon a revolution in Brazil has established a new government there with an imperial title at the head of which is placed a prince in whom the regency had been vested by the King at the time of his departure. There is reason to expect that by amicable negotiation the independence of Brazil will ere long be recognized by Portugal herself.With the remaining powers of Europe with those on the coast of Barbary and with all the new South American states our relations are of a friendly character. We have ministers plenipotentiary resing with the Republics of Colombia and Chile and have received ministers of the same rank from Columbia Guatemala Buenos Aires and Mexico. Our commercial relations with all those states are mutually beneficial and increasing. With the Republic of Colombia a treaty of commerce has been formed of which a copy is received and the original daily expected. A negotiation for a like treaty would have been commenced with Buenos Aires had it not been prevented by the indisposition and lamented decease of Mr. Rodney our minister there and to whose memory the most respectful attention has been shewn by the government of that Republic. An advantageous alteration in our treaty with Tunis has been obtained by our consular agent resing there the official document of which when received will be la before the Senate.The attention of the government has been drawn with great solicitude to other subjects and particularly to that relating to a state of maritime war involving the relative rights of neutral and belligerent in such wars. Most of the difficulties which we have experienced and of the losses which we have sustained since the establishment of our independence have proceeded from the unsettled state of those rights and the extent to which the belligerent claim has been carried against the neutral party.It is impossible to look back on the occurrences of the late wars in Europe and to behold the disregard which was pa to our rights as a neutral power and the waste which was made of our commerce by the parties to those wars by various acts of their respective governments and under the pretext by each that the other had set the example without great mortification and a fixed purpose never to submit to the like in future. An attempt to remove those causes of possible variance by friendly negotiation and on just principles which should be applicable to all parties could it was presumed be ed by none other than as a proof of an earnest desire to preserve those relations with every power.In the late war between France and Spain a crisis occurred in which it seemed probable that all controvertible principles involved in such wars might be brought into discussion and settled to the satisfaction of all parties. Propositions having this object in  have been made to the governments of Great Britain France Russia and of other powers which have been received in a friendly manner by all but as yet no treaty has been formed with either for its accomplishment. The policy will it is presumed be persevered in and in the hope that it may be successful.It will always be recollected that with one of the parties to those wars and from whom we received those injuries we sought redress by war. From the other by whose then reigning government our vessels were seized in port as well as at sea and their cargoes confiscated indemnity has been expected but has not yet been rendered. It was under the influence of the latter that our vessels were likewise seized by the governments of Spain Holland Denmark Sweden and Naples and from whom indemnity has been claimed and is still expected with the exception of Spain by whom it has been rendered.With both parties we had abundant cause of war but we had no alternative but to resist that which was most powerful at sea and pressed us nearest at home. With this all differences were settled by a treaty founded on conditions fair and honorable to both and which has been so far executed with perfect good faith. It has been earnestly hoped that the other would of its own accord and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation make to our citizens the indemnity to which they are entitled and thereby remove from our relations any just cause of discontent on our se.It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the current year exclusive of loans will exceed $18.5 million which with the sum remaining in the Treasury at the end of the last year amounting to $9463922.81 will after discharging the current disbursements of the year the interest on the public debt and upward of $11633011.52 of the principal leave a balance of more than $3 million in the Treasury on the first day of January next.A larger amount of the debt contracted during the late war bearing an interest of 6 percent becoming redeemable in the course of the ensuing year than could be discharged by the ordinary revenue the act of the 26th of May authorized a loan of $5 million at 4.5 percent to meet the same. By this arrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public of $75000.Under the act of the 24th of May last a loan of $5 million was authorized in order to meet the awards under the Flora treaty which was negotiated at par with the Bank of the United States at 4.5 percent the limit of interest fixed by the act. By this provision the claims of our citizens who had sustained so great a loss by spoliations and from whom indemnity had been so long withheld were promptly pa. For these advances the public will be amply repa at no distant day by the sale of the lands in Flora. Of the great advantages resulting from the acquisition of the territory in other respects too high an estimate can not be formed.It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the year 1825 will be sufficient to meet the disbursements of the year including the sum of $10 million which is annually appropriated by the act of constituting the sinking fund to the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt.The whole amount of the public debt on the first of January next may be estimated at $86 million inclusive of $2.5 million of the loan authorized by the act of the 26th of May last. In this estimate is included a stock of $7 million issued for the purchase of that amount of the capital stock of the Bank of the United States and which as the stock of the bank still held by the government will at least be fully equal to its reimbursement ought not to be consered as constituting a part of the public debt.Estimating then the whole amount of the public debt at $79 million and regarding the annual receipts and expenditures of the government a wellfounded hope may be entertained that should no unexpected event occur the whole of the public debt may be discharged in the course of 10 years and the government be left at liberty thereafter to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expenses to such other objects as may be most conducive to the public security and welfare. That the sums applicable to these objects will be very conserable may be fairly concluded when it is recollected that a large amount of the public revenue has been applied since the late war to the construction of the public buildings in this city; to the erection of fortifications along the coast and of arsenals in different parts of the Union; to the augmentation of the Navy; to the extinguishment of the Indian title to large tracts of fertile territory; to the acquisition of Flora; to pensions to Revolutionary officers and soldiers and to invals of the late war.On many of these objects the expense will annually be diminished and cease at no distant period on most of them.On the [19170101] the public debt amounted to $123491965.16 and notwithstanding the large sums which have been applied to these objects it has been reduced since that period $37446961.78. The last portion of the public debt will be redeemable on [18350101] and while there is the best reason to believe that the resources of the government will be continually adequate to such portions of it as may become due in the interval it is recommended to Congress to seize every opportunity which may present itself to reduce the rate of interest on every part thereof. The high state of the public credit and the great abundance of money are at this time very favorable to such a result. It must be very gratifying to our fellow citizens to witness this flourishing state of the public finances when it is recollected that no burthen whatever has been imposed upon them.The military establishment in all its branches in the performance of the various duties assigned to each justifies the favorable  which was presented of the efficiency of its organization at the last session. All the appropriations have been regularly applied to the objects intended by Congress and so far as the disbursements have been made the accounts have been rendered and settled without loss to the public.The condition of the Army itself as relates to the officers and men in science and discipline is highly respectable. The military academy on which the Army essentially rests and to which it is much indebted for this state of improvement has attained in comparison with any other institution of a like kind a high degree of perfection.Experience however has shewn that the dispersed condition of the corps of artillery is unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch of the military establishment. To remedy this inconvenience eleven companies have been assembled at the fortification erected at Old Point Comfort as a school for artillery instruction with intention as they shall be perfected in the various duties of that service to order them to other posts and to supply their places with other companies for instruction in like manner. In this mode a complete knowledge of the science and duties of this arm will be extended throughout the whole corps of artillery. But to carry this object fully into effect will require the a of Congress to obtain which the subject is now submitted to your conseration.Of the progress which has been made in the construction of fortifications for the permanent defense of our maritime frontier according to the plan deced on and to the extent of the existing appropriations the report of the Secretary of War which is herewith communicated will give a detailed account. Their final completion can not fail to give great additional security to that frontier and to diminish proportionably the expense of defending it in the event of war.The provisions in several acts of Congress of the last session for the improvement of the igation of the Mississippi and the Ohio of the harbor of Presqu'isle on Lake Erie and the repair of the Plymouth beach are in a course of regular execution; and there is reason to believe that the appropriation in each instance will be adequate to the object. To carry these improvements fully into effect the superintendence of them has been assigned to officers of the Corps of Engineers.Under the act of 30th April last authorizing the Present to cause a survey to be made with the necessary plans and estimates of such roads and canals as he might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of  or for the transportation of the mail a board has been instituted consisting of two distinguished officers of the Corps of Engineers and a distinguished civil engineer with assistants who have been actively employed in carrying into effect the object of the act. They have carefully examined the route between the Potomac and the Ohio rivers; between the latter and Lake Erie; between the Alleghany and the Susquehannah; and the routes between the Delaware and the Raritan Barnstable and Buzzards Bay and between Boston Harbor and Narraganset Bay. Such portion of the Corps of Topographical Engineers as could be spared from the survey of the coast has been employed in surveying the very important route between the Potomac and the Ohio. Conserable progress has been made in it but the survey can not be completed until the next season. It is gratifying to add from the  already taken that there is good cause to believe that this great national object may be fully accomplished.It is cond to commence early in the next season the execution of the other branch of the act—that which relates to roads—and with the survey of a route from this city through the Southern states to New Orleans the importance of which can not be too highly estimated. All the officers of both the corps of engineers who could be spared from other services have been employed in exploring and surveying the routes for canals. to digest a plan for both objects for the great purposes specified will require a thorough knowledge of every part of our Union and of the relation of each part to the others and of all to the seat of the general government. For such a digest it will be necessary that the information be full minute and precise.With a  to these important objects I submit to the conseration of the Congress the propriety of enlarging both the corps of engineers—the military and topographical. It need scarcely be remarked that the more extensively these corps are engaged in the improvement of their country in the execution of the powers of Congress and in a of the states in such improvements as lie beyond that limit when such a is desired the happier the effect will be in many s of which the subject is perceptible. By profiting of their science the works will always be well executed and by giving to the officers such employment our Union will derive all the advantage in peace as well as in war from their talents and services which they can afford. In this mode also the military will be incorporated with the civil and unfounded and injurious distinctions and prejudices of every kind be done away. To the corps themselves this service can not fail to be equally useful since by the knowledge they would thus acquire they would be eminently better qualified in the event of war for the great purposes for which they were instituted.Our relations with the Indian tribes within our limits have not been materially changed during the year. The hostile disposition evinced by certain tribes on the Missouri during the last year still continues and has extended in some degree to those on the Upper Mississippi and the Upper Lakes. Several parties of our citizens have been plundered and murdered by those tribes. In order to establish relations of friendship with them Congress at the last session made an appropriation for treaties with them and for the employment of a suitable military escort to accompany and attend the commissioners at the places appointed for the negotiations. This object has not been effected. The season was too far advanced when the appropriation was made and the distance too great to permit it but measures have been taken and all the preparations will be completed to accomplish it at an early period in the next season.Believing that the hostility of the tribes particularly on the Upper Mississippi and the Lakes is in no small degree owing to the wars which are carried on between the tribes resing in that quarter measures have been taken to bring about a general peace among them which if successful will not only tend to the security of our citizens but be of great advantage to the Indians themselves.With the exception of the tribes referred to our relations with all the others are on the same friendly footing and it affords me great satisfaction to add that they are making steady advances in civilization and the improvement of their condition. Many of the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized life. This desirable result has been brought about by the humane and persevering policy of the government and particularly by means of the appropriation for the civilization of the Indians. There have been established under the provisions of this act 32 schools containing 916 scholars who are well instructed in several branches of literature and likewise in agriculture and the ordinary arts of life.Under the appropriation to authorize treaties with the Creeks and Quaupaw Indians commissioners have been appointed and negotiations are now pending but the result is not yet known.For more full information respecting the principle which has been adopted for carrying into effect the act of Congress authorizing surveys with plans and estimates for canals and roads and on every other branch of duty incent to the Department of War I refer you to the report of the Secretary.The squadron in the Mediterranean has been maintained in the extent which was proposed in the report of the Secretary of the Navy of the last year and has afforded to our commerce the necessary protection in that sea. Apprehending however that the unfriendly relations which have existed between Algiers and some of the powers of Europe might be extended to us it has been thought expedient to augment the force there and in consequence the North Carolina a ship of the line has been prepared and will sail in a few days to join it.The force employed in the Gulf of Mexico and in the neighboring seas for the suppression of piracy has likewise been preserved essentially in the state in which it was during the last year. A persevering effort has been made for the accomplishment of that object and much protection has thereby been afforded to our commerce but still the practice is far from being suppressed. From every  which has been taken of the subject it is thought that it will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish our force in that quarter.There is reason to believe that the piracies now complained of are committed by bands of robbers who inhabit the land and who by preserving good intelligence with the towns and seizing favorable opportunities rush forth and fall on unprotected merchant vessels of which they make an easy prey. The pillage thus taken they carry to their lurking places and dispose of afterwards at prices tending to seduce the neighboring population.This combination is understood to be of great extent and is the more to be deprecated because the crime of piracy is often attended with the murder of the crews these robbers knowing if any survived their lurking places would be exposed and they be caught and punished. That this atrocious practice should be carried to such extent is cause of equal surprise and regret. It is presumed that it must be attributed to the relaxed and feeble state of the local governments since it is not doubted from the high character of the governor of Cuba who is well known and much respected here that if he had the power he would promptly suppress it. Whether those robbers should be pursued on the land the local authorities be made responsible for these atrocities or any other measure be resorted to to suppress them is submitted to the conseration of Congress.In execution of the laws for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel has been occasionally sent from that squadron to the coast of Africa with orders to return thence by the usual track of the slave ships and to seize any of our vessels which might be engaged in that trade. None have been found and it is believed that none are thus employed. It is well known however that the trade still exists under other flags.The health of our squadron while at Thompsons Island has been much better during the present than it was the last season. Some improvements have been made and others are cond there which it is believed will have a very salutary effect.On the Pacific our commerce has much increased and on that coast as well as on that sea the United States have many important interests which require attention and protection. It is thought that all the conserations which suggested the expediency of placing a squadron on that sea operate with augmented force for maintaining it there at least in equal extent.For detailed information respecting the state of our maritime force on each sea the improvement necessary to be made on either in the organization of the al establishment generally and of the laws for its better government I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy which is herewith communicated.The revenue of the Post Office Department has received a conserable augmentation in the present year. The current receipts will exceed the expenditures although the transportation of the mail within the year has been much increased. A report of the Postmaster General which is transmitted will furnish in detail the necessary information respecting the administration and present state of this department.In conformity with a resolution of Congress of the last session an invitation was given to General Lafayette to visit the United States with an assurance t
at a ship of war should attend at any port of France which he might designate to receive and convey him across the Atlantic whenever it might be convenient for him to sail. declined the offer of the public ship from motives of delicacy but assured me that he had long intended and would certainly visit our Union in the course of the present year.In August last he arrived at New York where he was received with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which his very important and disinterested services and sacrifices in our Revolutionary struggle so eminently entitled him. A corresponding sentiment has since been manifested in his favor throughout every portion of our Union and affectionate invitations have been given him to extend his visits to them. To these he has yielded all the accommodation in his power. At every designated point of rendezvous the whole population of the neighboring country has been assembled to greet him among whom it has excited in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all to behold the surviving members of our Revolutionary contest civil and military who had shared with him in the toils and dangers of the war many of them in a decrepit state. A more interesting spectacle it is believed was never witnessed because none could be founded on purer principles none proceed from higher or more disinterested motives. That the feelings of those who had fought and bled with him in a common cause should have been much excited was natural.There are however circumstances attending these inters which pervaded the whole community and touched the breasts of every age even the youngest among us. There was not an inual present who had not some relative who had not partaken in those scenes nor an infant who had not heard the relation of them. But the circumstance which was most sensibly felt and which his presence brought forcibly to the recollection of all was the great cause in which we were engaged and the blessings which we have derived from our success in it.The struggle was for independence and liberty public and personal and in this we succeeded. The meeting with one who had borne so distinguished a part in that great struggle and from such lofty and disinterested motives could not fail to affect profoundly every inual and of every age. It is natural that we should all take a deep interest in his future welfare as we do. His high claims on our union are felt and the sentiment universal that they should be met in a generous spirit. Under these impressions I invite your attention to the subject with a  that regarding his very important services losses and sacrifices a provision may be made and tendered to him which shall correspond with the sentiments and be worthy the character of the American people.In turning our attention to the condition of the civilized world in which the United States have always taken a deep interest it is gratifying to see how large a portion of it is blessed with peace. The only wars which now exist within that limit are those between Turkey and Greece in Europe and between Spain and the new governments our neighbors in this hemisphere. In both these wars the cause of independence of liberty and humanity continues to prevail.The success of Greece when the relative population of the contending parties is consered commands our admiration and  and that it has had a similar effect with the neighboring powers is obvious. The feeling of the whole civilized world is excited in a high degree in their favor. May we not hope that these sentiments winning on the hearts of their respective governments may lead to a more decisive result; that they may produce an accord among them to replace Greece on the ground which she formerly held and to which her heroic exertions at this day so eminently entitle her?With respect to the contest to which our neighbors are a party it is event that Spain as a power is scarcely felt in it. These new states had completely achieved their independence before it was acknowledged by the United States and they have since maintained it with little foreign pressure. The disturbances which have appeared in certain portions of that vast territory have proceeded from internal causes which had their origin in their former governments and have not yet been thoroughly removed.It is manifest that these causes are daily losing their effect and that these new states are settling down under governments elective and representative in every branch similar to our own. In this course we ardently wish them to persevere under a firm conviction that it will promote their happiness. In this their career however we have not interfered believing that every people have a right to institute for themselves the government which in their judgment may suit them best.Our example is before them of the good effect of which being our neighbors they are competent judges and to their judgment we leave it in the expectation that other powers will pursue the same policy. The deep interest which we take in their independence which we have acknowledged and in their enjoyment of all the rights incent thereto especially in the very important one of instituting their own governments has been declared and is known to the world.Separated as we are from Europe by the great Atlantic Ocean we can have no concern in the wars of the European governments nor in the causes which produce them. The balance of power between them into whichever scale it may turn in its various vibrations can not affect us. It is the interest of the United States to preserve the most friendly relations with every power and on conditions fair equal and applicable to all.But in regard to our neighbors our situation is different. It is impossible for the European governments to interfere in their concerns especially in those alluded to which are vital without affecting us; indeed the motive which might induce such interference in the present state of the war between the parties if a war it may be called would appear to be equally applicable to us. It is gratifying to know that some of the powers with whom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse and to whom these s have been communicated have appeared to acquiesce in them.The augmentation of our population with the expansion of our union and increased number of states have produced effects in certain branches of our system which merit the attention of Congress. Some of our arrangements and particularly the judiciary establishment were made with a  to the original 13 states only. Since then the United States have acquired a vast extent of territory; eleven new states have been admitted into the Union and territories have been la off for three others which will likewise be admitted at no distant day.An organization of the Supreme Court which assigns the judges any portion of the duties which belong to the inferior requiring their passage over so vast a space under any distribution of the states that may now be made if not impracticable in the execution must render it impossible for them to discharge the duties of either branch with advantage to the Union. The duties of the Supreme Court would be of great importance if its decisions were confined to the ordinary limits of other tribunals but when it is consered that this court deces and in the last resort on all the great questions which arise under our Constitution involving those between the United states inually between the states and the United States and between the latter and foreign powers too high an estimate of their importance can not be formed. The great interests of the nation seem to require that the judges of the Supreme Court should be exempted from every other duty than those which are incent to that high trust. The organization of the inferior courts would of course be adapted to circumstances. It is presumed that such an one might be formed as would secure an able and faithful discharge of their duties and without any material augmentation of expense.The condition of the aborigines within our limits and especially those who are within the limits of any of the states merits likewise particular attention. Experience has shown that unless the tribes be civilized they can never be incorporated into our system in any form whatever. it has likewise shown that in the regular augmentation of our population with the extension of our settlements their situation will become deplorable if their extinction is not menaced.Some welldigested plan which will rescue them from such calamities is due to their rights to the rights of humanity and to the honor of the nation. Their civilization is indispensable to their safety and this can be accomplished only by degrees. The process must commence with the infant state through whom some effect may be wrought on the parental. Difficulties of the most serious character present themselves to the attainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which they now rese. To remove them from it by force even with a  to their own security and happiness would be revolting to humanity and utterly unjustifiable. Between the limits of our present states and territories and the Rocky Mountains and Mexico there is a vast territory to which they might be invited with inducements which might be successful. It is thought if that territory should be ed into districts by previous agreement with the tribes now resing there and civil governments be established in each with schools for every branch of instruction in literature and the arts of civilized life that all the tribes now within our limits might gradually be drawn there. The execution of this plan would necessarily be attended with expense and that not inconserable but it is doubted whether any other can be devised which would be less liable to that objection or more likely to succeed.In looking to the interests which the United States have on the Pacific Ocean and on the western coast of this continent the propriety of establishing a military post at the mouth of the Columbia River or at some other point in that quarter within our acknowledged limits is submitted to the conseration of Congress. Our commerce and fisheries on that sea and along the coast have much increased and are increasing. It is thought that a military post to which our ships of war might resort would afford protection to every interest and have a tendency to conciliate the tribes to the Northwest with whom our trade is extensive. It is thought also that by the establishment of such a post the intercourse between our Western states and territories and the Pacific and our trade with the tribes resing in the interior on each se of the Rocky Mountains would be essentially promoted. To carry this object into effect the appropriation of an adequate sum to authorize the employment of a frigate with an officer of the Corps of Engineers to explore the mouth of the Columbia River and the coast contiguous thereto to enable the executive to make such establishment at the most suitable point is recommended to Congress.It is thought that attention is also due to the improvement of this city. The communication between the public buildings and in various other parts and the grounds around those buildings require it. It is presumed also that the completion of the canal from the Tiber to the Eastern Branch would have a very salutary effect. Great exertions have been made and expenses incurred by the citizens in improvements of various kinds; but those which are suggested belong exclusively to the government or are of a nature to require expenditures beyond their resources. The public lots which are still for sale would it is not doubted be more than adequate for these purposes.From the  above presented it is manifest that the situation of the United States is in the highest degree prosperous and happy. There is no object which as a people we can desire which we do not possess or which is not within our reach. Blessed with governments the happiest which the world ever knew with no distinct orders in society or ed interests in any portion of the vast territory over which their dominion extends we have every motive to cling together which can animate a virtuous and enlightened people. The great object is to preserve these blessings and to hand them down to the latest posterity.Our experience ought to satisfy us that our progress under the most correct and provent policy will not be exempt from danger. Our institutions form an important epoch in the history of the civilized world. On their preservation and in their utmost purity everything will depend. Extending as our interests do to every part of the inhabited globe and to every sea to which our citizens are carried by their industry and enterprise to which they are invited by the wants of others and have a right to go we must either protect them in the enjoyment of their rights or abandon them in certain events to waste and desolation.Our attitude is highly interesting as relates to other powers and particularly to our southern neighbors. We have duties to perform WRT all to which we must be faithful. To every kind of danger we should pay the most vigilant and unceasing attention remove the cause where it may be practicable and be prepared to meet it when inevitable.Against foreign danger the policy of the government seems to be already settled. The events of the late war admonished us to make our maritime frontier impregnable by a welldigested chain of fortifications and to give efficient protection to our commerce by augmenting our Navy to a certain extent which has been steadily pursued and which it is incumbent upon us to complete as soon as circumstances will permit. In the event of war it is on the maritime frontier that we shall be assailed. It is in that quarter therefore that we should be prepared to meet the attack. It is there that our whole force will be called into action to prevent the destruction of our towns and the desolation and pillage of the interior.To give full effect to this policy great improvements will be indispensable. Access to those works by every practicable communication should be made easy and in every direction. The intercourse between every part of our union should also be promoted and facilitated by the exercise of those powers which may comport with a faithful regard to the great principles of our Constitution. With respect to internal causes those great principles point out with equal certainty the policy to be pursued.Resting on the people as our governments do state and national with welldefined powers it is of the highest importance that they severally keep within the limits prescribed to them. Fulfilling that sacred duty it is of equal importance that the movement between them be harmonious and in case of any disagreement should any such occur a calm appeal be made to the people and that their voice be heard and promptly obeyed. Both governments being instituted for the common good we can not fail to prosper while those who made them are attentive to the conduct of their representatives and control their measures. In the pursuit of these great objects let a generous spirit and national s and feelings be indulged and let every part recollect that by cherishing that spirit and improving the condition of the others in what relates to their welfare the general interest will not only be promoted but the local advantage be reciprocated by all.I can not conclude this communication the last of the kind which I shall have to make without recollecting with great sensibility and heart felt gratitude the many instances of the public confence and the generous support which I have received from my fellow citizens in the various trusts with which I have been honored. Having commenced my service in early youth and continued it since with few and short intervals I have witnessed the great difficulties to which our union has been surmounted. From the present prosperous and happy state I derive a gratification which I can not express. That these blessings may be preserved and perpetuated will be the object of my fervent and unceasing prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe. 
Having examined and consered the Bill entitled An Act incorporating the protestant Episcopal Church in the Town of Alexandria in the District of Columbia I now return the Bill to the House of Representatives in which it originated with the following objections.Because the Bill exceeds the rightful authority to which Governments are limited by the essential distinction between Civil and Religious s and violates in particular the Article of the Constitution of the United States which declares that Congress shall make no law respecting a Religious establishment. The Bill enacts into and establishes by law sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to the organization and polity of the Church incorporated and comprehending even the election and removal of the Minister of the same so that no change could be made therein by the particular Society or by the General Church of which it is a member and whose authority it recognizes. This particular Church therefore would so far be a religious establishment by law a legal force and sanction being given to certain articles in its constitution and administration. Nor can it be consered that the articles thus established are to be taken as the descriptive criteria only of the corporate entity of the Society in as much as this entity must depend on other characteristics as the regulations established are generally unessential and alterable according to the principles and cannons by which Churches of that denomination govern themselves and as the injunctions &amp; prohibitions contained in the regulations would be enforced by the penal consequences applicable to a violation of them according to the local law.Because the Bill vests in the sa incorporated Church an authority to prove for the support of the poor and the education of poor children of the same an authority which being altogether superfluous if the provision is to be the result of pious charity would be a precent for giving to religious Societies as such a legal agency in carrying into effect a public and civil duty.
Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:Many causes unite to make your present meeting peculiarly interesting to out constituents. The operation of our laws on the various subjects to which they apply with the amendments which they occasionally require imposes annually an important duty on the representatives of a free people.Our system has happily advanced to such maturity that I am not aware that your cares in that respect will be augmented. Other causes exist which are highly interesting to the whole civilized world and to no portion of it more so in certain s than to the United States. Of these causes and of their bearing on the interests of our union I shall communicate the sentiments which I have formed with that freedom which a sense of duty dictates. It is proper however to invite your attention in the first instance to those concerns respecting which legislative provision is thought to be particularly urgent.On the 24th of June last a convention of igation and commerce was concluded in this city between the United States and France by ministers duly authorized for the purpose. The sanction of the executive having been given to this convention under a conviction that taking all its stipulations into  it rested essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage I deemed it my duty in compliance with the authority vested in the executive by the second section of the act of the last session of the 6th of May concerning igation to suspend by proclamation until the end of the next session of Congress the operation of the act entitled An act to impose a new tonnage duty on French ships and vessels and for other purposes and to suspend likewise all other duties on French vessels or the goods imported in them which exceeded the duties on American vessels and on similar goods imported in them. I shall submit this convention forthwith to the Senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification.Since your last session the prohibition which had been imposed on the commerce between the United States and the British colonies in the West Indies and on this continent has likewise been removed. Satisfactory evence having been adduced that the ports of those colonies had been opened to the vessels of the United States by an act of the British Parliament bearing date on the 24th of June last on the conditions specified therein I deemed it proper in compliance with the provision of the first section of the act of the last session above recited to declare by proclamation bearing date on the 24th of August last that the ports of the United States should thenceforward and until the end of the next session of Congress be opened to the vessels of Great Britain employed in that trade under the limitation specified in that proclamation.A doubt was entertained whether the act of Congress applied to the British colonies on this continent as well as to those in the West Indies but as the act of Parliament opened the intercourse equally with both and it was the manifest intention of Congress as well as the obvious policy of the United States that the provisions of the act of Parliament should be met in equal extent on the part of the United States and as also the act of Congress was supposed to vest in the Present some discretion in the execution of it I thought it advisable to give it a corresponding construction.Should the constitutional sanction of the Senate be given to the ratification of the convention with France legislative provisions will be necessary to carry it fully into effect as it likewise will be to continue in force on such conditions as may be deemed just and proper the intercourse which has been opened between the United States and the British colonies. Every light in the possession of the executive will in due time be communicated on both subjects.Resting essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage it has been the object of the executive in transactions with other powers to meet the propositions of each with a liberal spirit believing that thereby the interest of our country would be most effectually promoted. This course has been systematically pursued in the late occurrences with France and Great Britain and in strict accord with the s of the legislature. A confent hope is entertained that by the arrangement thus commenced with each all differences respecting igation and commerce with the dominions in question will be adjusted and a sol foundation be la for an active and permanent intercourse which will prove equally advantageous to both parties.The decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia on the question submitted to him by the United States and Great Britain concerning the construction of the first article of the Treaty of Ghent has been received. A convention has since been concluded between the parties under the mediation of His Imperial Majesty to prescribe the mode by which that article shall be carried into effect in conformity with that decision. I shall submit this convention to the Senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification and if obtained shall immediately bring the subject before Congress for such provisions as may require the interposition of the legislature.In compliance with an act of the last session a territorial government has been established in Flora on the principles of our system. By this act the inhabitants are secured in the full enjoyment of their rights and liberties and to admission into the Union with equal participation in the government with the original states on the conditions heretofore prescribed to other territories. By a clause in the ninth article of the treaty with Spain by which that territory was ceded to the United States it is stipulated that satisfaction shall be made for the injuries if any which by process of law shall be established to have been suffered by the Spanish officers and inual Spanish inhabitants by the late operations of our troops in Flora. No provision having yet been made to carry that stipulation into effect it is submitted to the conseration of Congress whether it will not be proper to vest the competent power in the district court at Pensacola or in some tribunal to be specially organized for the purpose.The fiscal operations of the year have been more successful than had been anticipated at the commencement of the last session of Congress.The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded the sum of $14.745 million. The payments made at the Treasury during the same period have exceeded $12.279 million leaving the Treasury on the 30th day of September last including $1168592.24 which were in the Treasury on the first day of January last a sum exceeding $4.128 million.Beses discharging all demands for the current service of the year including the interest and reimbursement of the public debt the 6 percent stock of 1796 amounting to $80000 has been redeemed. It is estimated that after defraying the current expenses of the present quarter and redeeming the $2 million of 6 percent stock of 1820 there will remain in the Treasury on the first of January next nearly $3 million. It is estimated that the gross amount of duties which have been secured from the first of January to the 30th of September last has exceeded $19.5 million and the amount for the whole year will probably not fall short of $23 million.Of the actual force in service under the present military establishment the posts at which it is stationed and the condition of each post a report from the Secretary of War which is now communicated will give a distinct ea. By like reports the state of the academy at West Point will be seen as will be the progress which has been made on the fortifications along the coast and at the national armories and arsenals.The organization of the several corps composing the Army is such as to admit its expansion to a great extent in case of emergency the officers carrying with them all the light which they possess to the new corps to which they might be appointed.With the organization of the staff there is equal cause to be satisfied. By the concentration of every branch with its chief in this city in the presence of the department and with a grade in the chief military station to keep alive and cherish a military spirit the greatest promptitude in the execution of orders with the greatest economy and efficiency are secured. The same  is taken of the military academy. Good order is preserved in it and the youth are well instructed in every science connected with the great objects of the institution. They are also well trained and disciplined in the practical parts of the profession. It has been always found difficult to control the ardor inseparable from that early age in such manner as to give it a proper direction. The rights of manhood are too often claimed prematurely in pressing which too far the respect which is due to age and the obedience necessary to a course of study and instruction in every such institution are sometimes lost sight of. The great object to be accomplished is the restraint of that ardor by such wise regulations and government as by directing all the energies of the youthful mind to the attainment of useful knowledge will keep it within a just subordination and at the same time elevate it to the highest purposes. This object seems to be essentially obtained in this institution and with great advantage to the union.The military academy forms the basis in regard to science on which the military establishment rests. It furnishes annually after due examination and on the report of the academic staff many wellinformed youths to fill the vacancies which occur in the several corps of the Army while others who retire to private life carry with them such attainments as under the right reserved to the several states to appoint the officers and to train the militia will enable them by affording a wer field for selection to promote the great object of the power vested in Congress of proving for the organizing arming and disciplining the militia. Thus by the mutual and harmonious cooperation of the two governments in the execution of a power ed between them an object always to be cherished the attainment of a great result on which our liberties may depend can not fail to be secured. I have to add that in proportion as our regular force is small should the instruction and discipline of the militia the great resource on which we rely be pushed to the utmost extent that circumstances will admit.A report from the Secretary of the Navy will communicate the progress which has been made in the construction of vessels of war with other interesting details respecting the actual state of the affairs of that department. It has been found necessary for the protection of our commerce to maintain the usual squadrons on the Mediterranean the Pacific and along the Atlantic coast extending the cruises of the latter into the West Indies where piracy organized into a system has preyed on the commerce of every country trading thither. A cruise has also been maintained on the coast of Africa when the season would permit for the suppression of the slave trade and orders have been given to the commanders of all our public ships to seize our own vessels should they find any engaging in that trade and to bring them in for adjudication.In the West Indies piracy is of recent date which may explain the cause why other powers have not combined against it. By the documents communicated it will be seen that the efforts of the United States to suppress it have had a very salutary effect. The benevolent provision of the act under which the protection has been extended alike to the commerce of other nations can not fail to be duly appreciated by them.In compliance with the act of the last session entitled An act to abolish the United States trading establishments agents were immediately appointed and instructed under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury to close the business of the trading houses among the Indian tribes and to settle the accounts of the factors and subfactors engaged in that trade and to execute in all other respects the injunction of that act in the mode prescribed therein. A final report of their proceedings shall be communicated to Congress as soon as it is received.It is with great regret I have to state that a serious malady has deprived us of many valuable citizens of Pensacola and checked the progress of some of those arrangements which are important to the territory. This effect has been sensibly felt in respect to the Indians who inhabit that territory consisting of the remnants of the several tribes who occupy the mdle ground between St. Augustine and Pensacola with extensive claims but undefined boundaries. Although peace is preserved with those Indians yet their position and claims tend essentially to interrupt the intercourse between the eastern and western parts of the territory on which our inhabitants are principally settled. It is essential to the growth and prosperity of the territory as well as to the interests of the Union that those Indians should be removed by special compact with them to some other position or concentration within narrower limits where they are. With the limited means in the power of the executive instructions were given to the Governor to accomplish this object so far as it might be practicable which was prevented by the distressing malady referred to. To carry it fully into effect in either mode additional funds will be necessary to the provision of which the powers of Congress are competent. With a  to such provision as may be deemed proper the subject is submitted to your conseration and in the interim further proceedings are suspended.It appearing that so much of the act entitled An act regulating the staff of the Army which passed on [18180414] as relates to the commissariat will expire in April next and the practical operation of that department having evinced its great utility the propriety of its renewal is submitted to your conseration.The  which has been taken of the probable productiveness of the lead mines connected with the importance of the material to the public defense makes it expedient that they should be managed with peculiar care. It is therefore suggested whether it will not comport with the public interest to prove by law for the appointment of an agent skilled in mineralogy to superintend them under the direction of the proper department.It is understood that the Cumberland road which was constructed at great expense has already suffered from the want of that regular superintendence and of those repairs which are indispensable to the preservation of such a work. This road is of incalculable advantage in facilitating the intercourse between the Western and the Atlantic states. Through the whole country from the northern extremity of Lake Erie to the Mississippi and from all the waters which empty into each finds and easy and direct communication to the seat of government and thence to the Atlantic. The facility which it affords to all military and commercial operations and also to those of the Post Office Department can not be estimated too highly. This great work is likewise an ornament and an honor to the nation.Believing that a competent power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement has not been granted to Congress but that such a power confined to great national purposes and with proper limitations would be productive of eminent advantage to our union I have thought it advisable that an amendment of the Constitution to that effect should be recommended to the several states.A bill which assumed the right to adopt and execute such a system having been presented for my signature at the last session I was compelled from the  which I had taken of the powers of the general government to negative it on which occasion I thought it proper to communicate the sentiments which I had formed on mature conseration on the whole subject. To that communication in all the s in which the great interest to which it relates may be supposed to merit your attention I have now to refer. Should Congress however deem it improper to recommend such an amendment they have according to my judgment the right to keep the road in repair by proving for the superintendence of it and appropriating the money necessary for repairs. Surely if they had the right to appropriate money to make the road they have a right to appropriate it to preserve the road from ruin. From the exercise of this power no danger is to be apprehended.Under our happy system the people are the sole and exclusive fountain of power. Each government originates from them and to them alone each to its proper constituents are they respectively and solely responsible for the faithful discharge of their duties within their constitutional limits; and that the people will confine their public agents of every station to the strict line of their constitutional duties there is no cause of doubt.Having however communicated my sentiments to Congress at the last session fully in the document to which I have referred respecting the right of appropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory in question I deem it improper to enlarge on the subject here.From the best information I have been able to obtain it appears that our manufactures though depressed immediately after the peace have conserably increased and are still increasing under the encouragement given them by the tariff of 1816 and by subsequent laws. Satisfied I am whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce proved all nations would concur in it and it was not liable to be interrupted by war which has never occurred and can not be expected that there are other strong reasons applicable to our situation and relations with other countries which impose on us the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures.Satisfied however I likewise am that the interest of every part of our Union even of those most benefitted by manufactures requires that this subject should be touched with the greatest caution and a critical knowledge of the effect to be produced by the slightest change. On full conseration of the subject in all its relations I am persuaded that a further augmentation may now be made of the duties on certain foreign articles in favor of our own and without affecting injuriously any other interest. For more precise details I refer you to the communications which were made to Congress during the last session.So great was the amount of accounts for moneys advanced during the late war in addition to others of a previous date which in the regular operations of the government necessarily remained unsettled that it required a conserable length of time for their adjustment. By a report from the first Comptroller of the Treasury it appears that on [18170304] the accounts then unsettled amounted to $103068876.41 of which on [19220930] $93175396.56 had been settled leaving on that day a balance unsettled of $9893479.85. That there have been drawn from the Treasury in paying the public debt and sustaining the government in all its operations and disbursements since [18170304] $157199380.96 the accounts for which have been settled to the amount of $137501451.12 leaving a balance unsettled of $19697929.84. for precise details respecting each of these balances I refer to the report of the Comptroller and the documents which accompany it.From this  it appears that our commercial differences with France and Great Britain have been placed in a train of amicable arrangement on conditions fair and honorable in both instances to each party; that our finances are in a very productive state our revenue being at present fully competent to all the demands upon it; that our military force is well organized in all its branches and capable of rendering the most important service in case of emergency that its number will admit of; that due progress has been made under existing appropriations in the construction of fortifications and in the operations of the Ordnance Department; that due progress has in like manner been made in the construction of ships of war; that our Navy is in the best condition felt and respected in every sea in which it is employed for the protection of our commerce; that our manufactures have augmented in amount and improved in quality; that great progress has been made in the settlement of accounts and in the recovery of the balances due by inuals and that the utmost economy is secured and observed in every department of the administration. Other objects will likewise claim your attention because from the station which the United States hold as a member of the great community of nations they have rights to maintain duties to perform and dangers to encounter.A strong hope was entertained that peace would ere this have been concluded between Spain and the independent governments south of the United States in this hemisphere. Long experience having evinced the competency of those governments to maintain the independence which they had declared it was presumed that the conserations which induced their recognition by the United States would have had equal weight with other powers and that Spain herself yielding to those magnanimous feelings of which her history furnishes so many examples would have terminated on that basis a controversy so uailing and at the same time so destructive. We still cherish the hope that this result will not long be postponed.Sustaining our neutral position and allowing to each party while the war continues equal rights it is incumbent on the United States to claim of each with equal rigor the faithful observance of our rights according to the wellknown law of nations. From each therefore a like cooperation is expected in the suppression of the piratical practice which has grown out of this war and of ades of extensive coasts on both seas which consering the small force employed to sustain them have not the slightest foundation to rest on.Europe is still unsettled and although the war long menaced between Russia and Turkey has not broken out there is no certainty that the differences between those powers will be amicably adjusted. It is impossible to look to the oppressions of the country respecting which those differences arose without being deeply affected. The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feelings of which our nature is susceptible. Superior skill and refinement in the arts heroic gallantry in action disinterested patriotism enthusiastic zeal and devotion in favor of public and personal liberty are associated with our recollections of ancient Greece. That such a country should have been overwhelmed and so long hden as it were from the world under a gloomy despotism has been a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous minds for ages past. It was natural therefore that the reappearance of those people in their original character contending in favor of their liberties should produce that great excitement and sympathy in their favor which have been so signally displayed throughout the United States. A strong hope is entertained that these people will recover their independence and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth.A great effort has been made in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the people and it must be very consoling to all benevolent minds to see the extraordinary moderation with which it has been conducted. That it may promote the happiness of both nations is the ardent wish of this whole people to the expression of which we confine ourselves; for whatever may be the feelings or sentiments which every inual under our government has a right to indulge and express it is nevertheless a sacred maxim equally with the government and people that the destiny of every independent nation in what relates to such improvements of right belongs and ought to be left exclusively to themselves.Whether we reason from the late wars or from those menacing symptoms which now appear in Europe it is manifest that if a convulsion should take place in any of those countries it will proceed from causes which have no existence and are utterly unknown in these states in which there is but one order that of the people to whom the sovereignty exclusively belongs.Should war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread? Exempt as we are from these causes our internal tranquillity is secure; and distant as we are from the troubled scene and faithful to first principles in regard to other powers we might reasonably presume that we should not be molested by them. This however ought not to be calculated on as certain. Unprovoked injuries are often inflicted and even the peculiar felicity of our situation might with some be a cause for excitement and aggression.The history of the late wars in Europe furnishes a complete demonstration that no system of conduct however correct in principle can protect neutral powers from injury from any party; that a defenseless position and distinguished love of peace are the surest invitations to war and that there is no way to avo it other than by being always prepared and willing for just cause to meet it. If there be a people on earth whose more especial duty it is to be at all times prepared to defend the rights with which they are blessed and to surpass all others in sustaining the necessary burthens and in submitting to sacrifices to make such preparations it is undoubtedly the people of these states.When we see that a civil war of the most frightful character rages from the Adriatic to the Black Sea; that strong symptoms of war appear in other parts proceeding from causes which should it break out may become general and be of long duration; that the war still continues between Spain and the independent governments her late provinces in this hemisphere; that it is likewise menaced between Portugal and Brazil in consequence of the attempt of the latter to dismember itself from the former and that a system of piracy of great extent is maintained in the neighboring seas which will require equal vigilance and decision to suppress it the reasons for sustaining the attitude which we now hold and for pushing forward all our measures of defense with the utmost vigor appear to me to acquire new force.The United States owe to the world a great example and by means thereof to the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support. They have so far succeeded to the satisfaction of the virtuous and enlightened of every country. There is no reason to doubt that their whole movement will be regulated by a sacred regard to principle all our institutions being founded on that basis. The ability to support our own cause under any trial to which it may be exposed is the great point on which the public solicitude rests.It has been often charged against free governments that they have neither the foresight nor the virtue to prove at the proper season for great emergencies; that their course is improvent and expensive; that war will always find them unprepared and whatever may be its calamities that its terrible warnings will be disregarded and forgotten as soon as peace returns.I have full confence that this charge so far as relates to the United States will be shewn to be utterly destitute of truth. 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: At a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion and arming against each other and when those with whom we have principle intercourse are engaged in the general contest and when the countenance of some of them toward our peaceable country threatens that even that may not be affected by what is passing on the general theater a meeting of the representatives of the nation in both Houses of Congress has become more than usually desirable. Coming from every section of our country they bring with them the sentiments and the information of the whole And will be enabled to give direction to the public affairs which the will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.In taking a  of the state of our country we in the first place notice the late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times has occasionally visited our shores. Provence in His goodness gave it an early termination on this occasion and lessened the number of victims which have usually fallen before it. In the course of the several visitations by this disease it has appeared that it is strictly local incent to cities and on the te waters only incommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease or by goods carried from diseased places; that its access is with the autumn and it disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions within narrow limits of time and space give security even to our maritime cities three fourths of the year and to the country always. Although from these facts it appears unnecessary yet to satisfy the fears of foreign nations and cautions on their part not to be complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them I have strictly enjoined on the officers at the head of customs to certify with exact truth for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of health respecting this fever which prevails at the place from which she sails.. Under every motive from character and duty to certify the truth I have no doubt they have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real injury has however been sustained from a propensity to entify with this endemic and to call by the same name fevers of very different kinds which have been placed among those deemed contagious. As we advance in our knowledge of this disease as facts develop the source from which inuals receive it the State authorities charged with the care of the public health and Congress with that of the general commerce will become able to regulate with effect their respective s in these departments. The burthen of quarantines is felt at home as well as abroad; their efficacy merits examination. Although the health laws of the States should be found to need no present revisal by Congress yet commerce claims that their attention be ever awake to them.Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has conserably changed. Our coasts have been infested and our harbors watched by private armed vessels some of them without commissions some with illegal commissions others with those legal form. But committing piratical acts beyond the authority of their commissions. They have captured in the very entrance of our harbors  as well as on the high seas not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade with us but our own also. They have carried them off under pretense of legal adjudication but not daring to approach a court of justice they have plundered and sunk them by the way or in obscure places where no evence could arise against them maltreated the crews and abandoned them in boats in the open sea or on desert shores without food or covering. These enormities appearing to be unreached by any control of their sovereigns I found it necessary to equip a force to cruise within our own seas to arrest all vessels of these descriptions found hovering on our coasts within the limits of the Gulf Stream and to bring the offenders in for trial as pirates.The same system of hovering on our coasts and harbors under color of seeking enemies has been also carried on by public armed ships to the great annoyance and oppression of our commerce. New principles too have been interpolated into the law of nations founded neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment of nations. According to these belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its own enemy which it denies to a neutral on the ground of its aing that enemy in the war; but reason revolts at such an inconsistency and the neutral having equal right with the belligerent to dece the question the interests of our constituents and the duty of maintaining the authority of reason the only umpire between just nations impose on us the obligation of proving an effectual and determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable nations. Indeed the confence we ought to have in the justice of others still countenances the hope that a sounder  of those rights will of itself induce from every belligerent a more correct observance of them.With Spain our negotiations for a settlement of differences have not had a satisfactory issue. Spoliations during a former war for which she had formally acknowledged herself responsible have been refused to be compensated but on conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them. Yet the same practices are renewed in the present war and are already of great amount. On the Mobile our commerce passing through that river continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches. Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries of Louisana have not been acceded to. While however the right is unsettled we have avoed changing the state of things by taking new posts or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories in the hope that the other power would not by contrary conduct oblige us to meet their example and endanger conflicts of authority the issue of which may not be easily controlled. But in this hope we have now reason to lessen our confence. Inroads have been recently made into the Territories of Orleans and the Mississippi our citizens have been seized and their property plundered in the very parts of the former which had been actually delivered up by Spain and this by the regular officers and soldiers of that Government. I have therefore found it necessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect our citizens and to repel by arms any similar aggressions in future. Other details necessary for your full information of the state of things between this country and that shall be the subject of another communication.In reing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers the moderation the firmness and the wisdom of the Legislature will all be called into action. We ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as well as of character will produce the justice we are bound to expect. But should any nation deceive itself by false calculations and disappointment that expectation we must join in unprofitable contest of trying which party can do the other the most harm. Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. Where that is competent it is always the most desirable. But some of them are of a nature to be met by force only and all of them may lead to it. I can not therefore but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for. The first object is to place our seaport town out of danger of insult. Measures have been already taken for furnishing them with heavy cannon for the service of such land batteries as may make apart of their defense against armed vessels approaching them. In a of these it is desirable we should have a competent number of gunboats and the number to be competent must be conserable. If immediately begun they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season. Whether it will be necessary to augment our land forces will be deced buy occurrences probably in the course of your session. In the meantime you will conser whether it would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as war so to organize or  the militia as would enable us on any sudden emergency to call for the services of the younger portions unencumbered with the old and those having families. Upward of 300000 ablebodied men between the ages of 18 and 26 years which the last census shews we may now count within our limits will furnish a competent number for offense or defense in any point where they may be wanted and will give time for raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall become certain; and the reducing to the early period of life all its active service can not but be desirable to our younger citizens of the present as well as future times inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their families. I can not then but earnestly recommend to your early conseration the expediency of so modifying our militia system as by a separation of the more active part from that which is less so we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for real and active service and to be called to it in regular rotation.Conserable provision has been made under former authorities from Congress of materials for the construction of ships of war of 74 guns. These materials are on hand subject to the further will of the Legislature.Turning from these unpleasant s of violence and wrong I congratulate you on the liberation of our fellowcitizens who were stranded on the coast of Tripoli and made prisoners of war. In a government bottomed on the will of all the life and liberty of every inual citizen become interesting to all. In the treaty therefore which has concluded our warefare with that State an article for the ransom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land by a small band of our countrymen and others engaged for the occasion in conjunction with the troops of the exBashaw of that county gallantly conducted by our late consul Eaton and their successful enterprise on the city of Derne contributed doubtless to the impression which produced peace and the concluison of this prevented opportunities of which the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli would have availed themselves to emulate the acts of valor exhibited by their brethren in the attack of last year. Reflecting with high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions permitted in the late Mediterranean service I think it would be an useful encouragement as well as a just reward to make an opening for some present promotion by enlarging our peace establishment of captains and lieutenants.With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently explained but friendly discussions with their ambassador recently arrived and a mutual disposition to do whatever is just and reasonable can not fail of dissipating these so that we may conser our peace on that coast generally to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that sea.The law proving for a al peace establishment fixes the number of frigates which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace and prescribes that they shall be manned by not more than twothirds of their complement of seamen and ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may be trusted to twothirds only of her proper complement of men must depend on the nature of the service on which she is ordered; that may sometimes for her safety as well as to insure her object require her fullest complement. In adverting to this subject Congress will perhaps conser whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion in this case would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the whole service rather than by the number of the vessels. Occasions oftener arise for the employment of small than of large vessels and it would lessen risk as well as expense to be authorized to employ them of preference. The limitation suggested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of vessels best adapted to the service.Our Indian neighbors are advancing many of them with spirit and others beginning to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and household manufacture. They are becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labor and more certainty than the forest and find it their interest from time e to time to dispose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the means of improving those they occupy and of subsisting their families while they are preparing their farms. Since your last session the Northern tribes have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut Reserve and the former Indian boundary and those on the Ohio rom the same boundary to the raps and for a conserable depth inland. The Chickasaws and Cherokees have sold us the country between and adjacent to the two districts of Tennessee and the Creeks the resue of their lands in the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Olcofauhatche. The three former purchases are important inasmuch as they consolate disjoined parts of our settled country and render their intercourse secure; and the second particularly so as  with the small point on the river which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws it completes our possession of the whole of both banks of the Ohio from its source to near its mouth and the igation of that river is thereby rendered forever safe to our citizens settled and settling on its extensive waters. The purchase from the Creeks too has been for some time particularly interesting to the State of Georgia.The several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both houses of Congress for the exercise of their respective s.Deputations now on their way to the seat of Government from various nations of Indians inhabiting the Missouri and other parts beyond the Mississippi come charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which they are placed with us of their dispositions to cultivate our peace and friendship and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse with us. A state of our progress in exploring the principle rivers of that country and of the information respecting them hitherto obtained will be communicated so soon as we shall receive some further relations which we have reason shortly to expect.The receipts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of September last have exceeded the sum 13000000 which  with not quite five millions in the Treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting other demands to pay nearly two millions of the debt contracted under the British treaty and convention upward of four millions of principle of the public debt and four millions of interest. These payments with those which had been made in three years and a half preceding have extinguished of the funded debt nearly eighteen millions of principle. Congress by their act of November 10 1803 authorized us to borrow $1750000 toward meeting the claims of our citizens assumed by the convention with France. We have not however made use o this authority because the sum of four millions and a half which remained in the Treasury on the same 30th day of September last with receipts which we may calculate on for the ensuing year beses paying the annual sum of $8000000 appropriated to the funded debt and meeting all the current demands which may be expected will enable us to pay the whole sum of $3750000 assumed by the French convention and still leave us a surplus of nearly $1000000 at our free disposal. Should you concur in the provisions of arms and armed vessels recommended by the circumstances of the times this surplus will furnish the means of doing so.On this first occasion of addressing Congress since by the choice of my constituents I have entered on a second term of administration I embrace the opportunity to give this public assurance that I will exert my best endeavors to administer faithfully the executive department and will zealously cooperate with you in every measure which may tend to secure the liberty property and personal safety of our fellowcitizens and to consolate the republican forms and principles of our Government.In the course of your session you shall receive all the a which I can give for the dispatch of public business and all the information necessary for your deliberations of which the interests of our own country and the confence reposed in us by others will admit a communication.
FellowCitizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: At an early day after the close of the last session of Congress an offer was formally communicated from His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia of his mediation as the common friend of the United States and Great Britain for the purpose of facilitating a peace between them. The high character of the Emperor Alexander being a satisfactory pledge for the sincerity and impartiality of his offer it was immediately accepted and as a further proof of the disposition on the part of the United States to meet their adversary in honorable experiments for terminating the war it was determined to avo intermediate delays incent to the distance of the parties by a definitive provision for the cond negotiation. Three of our eminent citizens were accordingly commissioned with the requisite powers to conclude a treaty of peace with persons clothed with like powers on the part of Great Britain. They are authorized also to enter into such conventional regulations of the commerce between the two countries as may be mutually advantageous. The two envoys who where in the United States at the time of their appointment have proceeded to join their colleague already at St. Petersburg.The envoys have received another commission authorizing them to conclude with Russia a treaty of commerce with a  to strengthen the amicable relations and improve the beneficial intercourse between the two countries.The issue of this friendly interposition of the Russian Emperor and this pacific manifestation on the part of the United States time only can dece. That the sentiments of Great Britain toward that Sovereign will have produced an acceptance of his offered mediation must be presumed. That no adequate motives exist to prefer a continuance of war with the United States to the terms on which they are willing to close it is certain. The British cabinet also must be sensible that with respect to the important question of impressment on which the war so essentially turns a search for or seizure of British persons or property on board neutral vessels on the high seas is not a belligerent right derived from the law of nations and it is obvious that no visit or search or use of force for any purpose on board the vessels of one independent power on the high seas can in war or peace be sanctioned by the laws or authority of another power. It is equally obvious that for the purpose of preserving to each State its seafaring members by excluding them from the vessels of the other the mode heretofore proposed by the United States and now enacted by them as an article of municipal policy can not for a moment be compared with the mode practiced by Great Britain without a conviction of its title to preference inasmuch as the latter leaves the discrimination between the mariners of the two nations to officers exposed by uoable bias as well as by a defect of evence to a wrong decision under circumstances precluding for the most part the enforcement of controlling penalties and where a wrong decision beses the irreparable violation of the sacred rights of persons might frustrate the plans and profits of entire voyages; whereas the mode assumed by the United States guards with studied fairness and efficacy against errors in such cases and avos the effect of casual errors on the safety of igation and the success of mercantile expeditions.If the reasonableness of expectations drawn from these conserations could guarantee their fulfillment a just peace would not be distant. But it becomes the wisdom of the National Legislature to keep in mind the true policy or rather the indispensable obligation of adapting its measures to the supposition that the only course to that happy event is in the vigorous employment of the resources of war. And painful as the reflection is this duty is particularly enforced by the spirit and manner in which the war continues to be waged by the enemy who uninfluenced by the unvaried examples of humanity set them are adding to the savage fury of it on one frontier a system of plunder and conflagration on the other equally forbden by respect for national character and by the established rules of civilized warfare.As an encouragement to persevering and invigorated exertions to bring the contest to a happy result I have the satisfaction of being able to appeal to the auspicious progress of our arms both by land and on the water.In continuation of the brilliant achievements of our infant Navy a signal triumph has been gained by Captain Lawrence and his companions in the Hornet sloop of war which destroyed a British sloop of war with a celerity so unexampled and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the loss in the Hornet as to claim for the conquerors the highest praise and the full recompense proved by Congress in preceding cases. Our public ships of war in general as well as the private armed vessels have continued also their activity and success against the commerce of the enemy and by their vigilance and address have greatly frustrated the efforts of the hostile squadrons distributed along our coasts to intercept them in returning into port and resuming their cruises.The augmentation of our al force as authorized at the last session of Congress is in progress. On the Lakes our superiority is near at hand where it is not already established.The events of the campaign so far as they are known to us furnish matter of congratulation and show that under a wise organization and efficient direction the Army is destined to a glory not less brilliant than that which already encircles the Navy. The attack and capture of York is in that quarter a presage of future and greater victories while on the western frontier the issue of the late siege of Fort Meigs leaves us nothing to regret but a single act of inconserate valor.The provisions last made for filling the ranks and enlarging the staff of the Army have had the best effects. It will be for the conseration of Congress whether other provisions depending on their authority may not still further improve the military establishment and the means of defense.The sudden death of the distinguished citizen who represented the United States in France without any special arrangements by him for such a contingency has left us without the expected sequel to his last communications nor has the French Government taken any measures for bringing the depending negotiations to a conclusion through its representative in the United States. This failure adds to delays before so unreasonably spun out. A successor to our deceased minister has been appointed and is ready to proceed on his mission. The course which he will pursue in fulfilling it is that prescribed by a steady regard to the true interests of the United States which equally avos an abandonment of their just demands and a connection of their fortunes with the systems of other powers.The receipts in the Treasury from the 1st of October to the 31st day of March last including the sums received on account of Treasury notes and of the loans authorized by the acts of the last and the preceding sessions of Congress have amounted to $15412000. The expenditures during the same period amounted to $15920000 and left in the Treasury on the 1st of April the sum of $1857000. The loan of $16000000 authorized by the act of the 8th of February last has been contracted for. Of that sum more than $1000000 had been pa into the Treasury prior to the 1st of April and formed a part of the receipts as above stated. The remainder of that loan amounting to near $15000000 with the sum of $5000000 authorized to be issued in Treasury notes and the estimated receipts from the customs and the sales of public lands amounting to $9300000 and making in the whole $29300000 to be received during the last nine months of the present year will be necessary to meet the expenditures already authorized and the engagements contracted in relation to the public debt. These engagements amount during that period to $10500000 which with near one million for the civil miscellaneous and diplomatic expenses both foreign and domestic and $17800000 for the military and al expenditures including the ships of war building and to be built will leave a sum in the Treasury at the end of the present year equal to that on the 1st of April last. A part of this sum may be consered as a resource for defraying any extraordinary expenses already authorized by law beyond the sums above estimated and a further resource for any emergency may be found in the sum of $1000000 the loan of which to the United States has been authorized by the State of Pennsylvania but which has not yet been brought into effect.This  of our finances whilst it shows that due provision has been made for the expenses of the current year shows at the same time by the limited amount of the actual revenue and the dependence on loans the necessity of proving more adequately for the future supplies of the Treasury. This can be best done by a welldigested system of internal revenue in a of existing sources which will have the effect both of abrging the amount of necessary loans and on that account as well as by placing the public credit on a more satisfactory basis of improving the terms on which loans may be obtained. The loan of sixteen millions was not contracted for at a less interest than about 7 1/2 per cent and although other causes may have had an agency it can not be doubted that with the advantage of a more extended and less precarious revenue a lower rate of interest might have sufficed. A longer postponement of this advantage could not fail to have a still greater influence on future loans.In recommending to the National Legislature this resort to additional taxes I feel great satisfaction in the assurance that our constituents who have already displayed so much zeal and firmness in the cause of their country will cheerfully give any other proof of their patriotism which it calls for. Happily no people with local and transitory exceptions never to be wholly avoed are more able than the people of the United States to spare for the public wants a portion of their private means whether regard be had to the ordinary profits of industry or the ordinary price of subsistence in our country compared with those in any other. And in no case could stronger reasons be felt for yielding the requisite contributions. By rendering the public resources certain and commensurate to the public exigencies the constituted authorities will be able to prosecute the war the more raply to its proper issue; every hostile hope founded on a calculated failure of our resources will be cut off and by adding to the evence of bravery and skill in combats on the ocean and the land and alacrity in supplying the treasure necessary to give them their fullest effect and demonstrating to the world the public energy which our political institutions combine with the personal liberty distinguishing them the best security will be proved against future enterprises on the rights or the peace of the nation.The contest in which the United States are engaged appeals for its support to every motive that can animate an uncorrupted and enlightened peopleto the love of country; to the pre of liberty; to an emulation of the glorious founders of their independence by a successful vindication of its violated attributes; to the gratitude and sympathy which demand security from the most degrading wrongs of a  of citizens who have proved themselves so worthy the protection of their country by their heroic zeal in its defense; and finally to the sacred obligation of transmitting entire to future generations that precious patrimony of national rights and independence which is held in trust by the present from the goodness of Divine Provence.Being aware of the inconveniences to which a protracted session at this season would be liable I limit the present communication to objects of primary importance. In special messages which may ensue regard will be had to the same conseration.JAMES MADISON.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: In calling you together sooner than a separation from your homes would otherwise have been required I yielded to conserations drawn from the posture of our foreign affairs and in fixing the present for the time of your meeting regard was had to the probability of further developments of the policy of the belligerent powers toward this country which might the more unite the national councils in the measures to be pursued.  At the close of the last session of Congress it was hoped that the successive confirmations of the extinction of the French decrees so far as they violated our neutral commerce would have induced the Government of Great Britain to repeal its orders in council and thereby authorize a removal of the existing obstructions to her commerce with the United States.  Instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the two nations the orders were at a moment when least to have been expected put into more rigorous execution; and it was communicated through the British envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the edicts of France as officially made known to the British Government was denied to have taken place it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the British orders that commerce should restored to a footing that would admit the productions and manufactures of Great Britain when owned by neutrals into markets shut against them by her enemy the United States being given to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their nonimportation act would lead to measures of retaliation.  At a later date it has indeed appeared that a communication to the British Government of fresh evence of the repeal of the French decrees against our neutral trade was followed by an intimation that it had been transmitted to the British plenipotentiary here in order that it might receive full conseration in the depending discussions. This communication appears not to have been received; but the transmission of it hither instead of founding on it an actual repeal of the orders or assurances that the repeal would ensue will not permit us to rely on any effective change in the British cabinet. To be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory proofs of such a change and to proceed in the mean time in adapting our measures to the s which have been disclosed through that minister will best consult our whole duty.  In the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures indemnity and redress for other wrongs have continued to be withheld and our coasts and the mouths of our harbors have again witnessed scenes not less derogatory to the dearest of our national rights than vexation to the regular course of our trade.  Among the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships of war hovering on our coasts was an encounter between 1 of them and the American frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers rendered uoable on the part of the latter by a fire commenced without cause by the former whose commander is therefore alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining the honor of the American flag. The proceedings of a court of inquiry requested by Captain Rodgers are communicated together with the correspondence relating to the occurrence between the Secretary of State and His Britannic Majesty's envoy. To these are added the several correspondences which have passed on the subject of the British orders in council and to both the correspondence relating to the Floras in which Congress will be made acquainted with the interposition which the Government of Great Britain has thought proper to make against the proceeding of the United States.  The justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the United States toward France both before and since the revocation of her decrees authorized an expectation that her Government would have followed up that measure by all such others as were due to our reasonable claims as well s dictated by its amicable professions. No proof however is yet given of an intention to repair the other wrongs done to the United States and particularly to restore the great amount of American property seized and condemned under edicts which though not affecting our neutral relations and therefore not entering into questions between the United States and other belligerents were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles that the reparation ought to have been prompt and ample.  In addition to this and other demands of strict right on that nation the United States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and unexpected restrictions to which their trade with the French dominions has been subjected and which if not discontinued will require at least corresponding restrictions on importations from France into the United States.  On all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary lately sent to Paris has carried with him the necessary instructions the result of which will be communicated to you by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the French Government toward the United States will enable you to adapt to it that of the United States toward France. Our other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes. With Russia they are on the best footing of friendship. The ports of Sweden have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions toward our commerce in the councils of that nation also and the information from our special minister to Denmark shews that the mission had been attended with valuable effects to our citizens whose property had been so extensively violated and endangered by cruisers under the Danish flag.  Under the ominous indications which commanded attention it became a duty to exert the means committed to the executive department in proving for the general security. The works of defense on our maritime frontier have accordingly been prosecuted with an activity leaving little to be added for the completion of the most important ones and as particularly suited for cooperation in emergencies a portion of the gun boats have in particular harbors been ordered into use. The ships of war before in commission with the addition of a frigate have been chiefly employed as a cruising guard to the rights of our coast and such a disposition has been made of our land forces as was thought to promise the services most appropriate and important.  In this disposition is included a force consisting of regulars and militia embodied in the Indiana Territory and marched toward our northwestern frontier. This measure was made requisite by several murders and depredations committed by Indians but more especially by the menacing preparations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash under the influence and direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With these exceptions the Indian tribes retain their peaceable dispositions toward us and their usual pursuits. I must now add that the period is arrived which claims from the legislative guardians of the national rights a system of more ample provisions for maintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous justice the protracted moderation and the multiplied efforts on the part of the United States to substitute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the 2 countries all the mutual advantages of reestablished friendship and confence we have seen that the British cabinet perseveres not only in withholding a remedy for other wrongs so long and so loudly calling for it but in the execution brought home to the threshold of our territory of measures which under existing circumstances have the character as well as the effect of war on our lawful commerce.  With this evence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which no independent nation can relinquish Congress will feel the duty of putting the United States into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis and corresponding with the national spirit and expectations.  I recommend accordingly that adequate provisions be made for filling the ranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops; for an auxiliary force to be engaged for a more limited term; for the acceptance of volunteer corps whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in urgent services; for detachments as they may be wanted of other portions of the militia and for such a preparation of the great body as will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the importance of those military seminaries which in every event will form a valuable and frugal part of our military establishment.  The manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success and the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions are adequate to emergencies. It will not be inexpedient however for Congress to authorize an enlargement of them.  Your attention will of course be drawn to such provisions on the subject of our al force as may be required for the services to which it may be best adapted. I submit to Congress the seasonableness also of an authority to augment the stock of such materials as are imperishable in their nature or may not at once be attainable. In contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous epoch and estimating their claims to our attention it is impossible to overlook those developing themselves among the great communities which occupy the southern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood. An enlarged philanthropy and an enlightened forecast concur in imposing on the national councils an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will to regard the progress of events and not to be unprepared for whatever order of things may be ultimately established. Under another aspect of our situation the early attention of Congress will be due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and infractions of our commercial laws. The practice of smuggling which is odious everywhere and particularly criminal in free governments where the laws being made by all for the good of all a fraud is committed on every inual as well as on the state attains its utmost guilt when it blends with a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency in the transgressors to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country. It is them that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enabled to manifest itself through the regular animadversions of the most competent laws.  To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag and to the honest interests which it covers it is expedient also that it be made punishable in our citizens to accepts licenses from foreign governments for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other American citizens or to trade under false colors or papers of any sort.  A prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance by our citizens of special licenses to be used in a trade with the United States and against the admission into particular ports of the United States of vessels from foreign countries authorized to trade with particular ports only. Although other subjects will press more immediately on your deliberations a portion of them can not but be well bestowed on the just and sound policy of securing to our manufactures the success they have attained and are still attaining in some degree under the impulse of causes not permanent and to our igation the fair extent of which is at present abrged by the unequal regulations of foreign governments.  Beses the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sacrifices which a change of circumstances might bring on them the national interest requires that WRT such articles at least as belong to our defense and our primary wants we should not be left in unnecessary dependence on external supplies. And whilst foreign governments adhere to the existing discriminations in their ports against our igation and an equality or lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their igation in our ports the effect can not be mistaken because it has been seriously felt by our shipping interests; and in proportion as this takes place the advantages of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign markets and of a growing body of mariners trained by their occupations for the service of their country in times of danger must be diminished.  The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of September last have exceeded $13.5M and have enabled us to defray the current expenses including the interest on the public debt and to reimburse more than $5M of the principal without recurring to the loan authorized by the act of the last session. The temporary loan obtained in the latter end of the year 1810 has also been reimbursed and is not included in that amount.  The decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce and the extraordinary expenses which have and may become necessary must be taken into  in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year; and I recommend to your conseration the propriety of insuring a sufficiency of annual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expenses of Government and to pay the interest on the public debt including that on new loans which may be authorized.  I can not close this communication without expressing my deep sense of the crisis in which you are assembled my confence in a wise and honorable result to your deliberations and assurances of the faithful zeal with which my cooperating duties will be discharged invoking at the same time the blessing of Heaven on our beloved country and on all the means that may be employed in vindicating its rights and advancing its welfare.
AND NOW FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN if the wise and learned philosophers of the elder world the first observers of nutation and aberration the discoverers of maddening ether and invisible planets the inventors of Congreve rockets and Shrapnel shells should find their hearts disposed to enquire what has America done for the benefit of mankind?Let our answer be this: America with the same voice which spoke herself into existence as a nation proclaimed to mankind the inextinguishable rights of human nature and the only lawful foundations of government. America in the assembly of nations since her admission among them has invariably though often fruitlessly held forth to them the hand of honest friendship of equal freedom of generous reciprocity.She has uniformly spoken among them though often to heedless and often to disdainful ears the language of equal liberty of equal justice and of equal rights.She has in the lapse of nearly half a century without a single exception respected the independence of other nations while asserting and maintaining her own.She has abstained from interference in the concerns of others even when conflict has been for principles to which she clings as to the last vital drop that visits the heart.She has seen that probably for centuries to come all the contests of that Aceldama the European world will be contests of inveterate power and emerging right.Wherever the standard of freedom and Independence has been or shall be unfurled there will her heart her benedictions and her prayers be.But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.She is the wellwisher to the freedom and independence of all.She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.She will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice and the benignant sympathy of her example.She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own were they even the banners of foreign independence she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue of inual avarice envy and ambition which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom.The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force....She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit....[America’s] glory is not dominion but liberty. Her march is the march of the mind. She has a spear and a shield: but the motto upon her shield is Freedom Independence Peace. This has been her Declaration: this has been as far as her necessary intercourse with the rest of mankind would permit her practice.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:The auspicious circumstances under which you will commence the duties of the present session will lighten the burdens inseparable from the high trust committed to you. The fruits of the earth have been unusually abundant commerce has flourished the revenue has exceeded the most favorable anticipation and peace and amity are preserved with foreign nations on conditions just and honorable to our country. For these inestimable blessings we can not but be grateful to that Provence which watches over the destiny of nations. As the term limited for the operation of the commercial convention with Great Britain will expire early in the month of July next and it was deemed important that there should be no interval during which that portion of our commerce which was proved for by that convention should not be regulated either by arrangement between the two Governments or by the authority of Congress the minister of the United States at London was instructed early in the last summer to invite the attention of the British Government to the subject with a  to that object. was instructed to propose also that the negotiation which it was wished to open might extend to the general commerce of the two countries and to every other interest and unsettled difference between them in the hope that an arrangement might be made on principles of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and prove in a satisfactory manner for all these high concerns. I have the satisfaction to state that the proposal was received by the British Government in the spirit which prompted it and that a negotiation has been opened at London embracing all these objects. On full conseration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it was thought proper to commit it to not less than two of our distinguished citizens and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris has been associated with our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at London to both of whom corresponding instructions have been given and they are now engaged in the discharge of its duties. It is proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience resulting from the delay incent to a negotiation on so many important subjects it was agreed before entering on it that the existing convention should be continued for a term not less than eight years. Our relations with Spain remain nearly in the state in which they were at the close of the last session. The convention of 1802 proving for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claims of our citizens for injuries sustained by spoliation and so long suspended by the Spanish Government has at length been ratified by it but no arrangement has yet been made for the payment of another portion of like claims not less extensive or well founded or for other es of claims or for the settlement of boundaries. These subjects have again been brought under conseration in both countries but no agreement has been entered into respecting them. In the mean time events have occurred which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that Government has so long pursued on the friendly relations of the two countries which it is presumed is at least of as much importance to Spain as to the United States to maintain. A state of things has existed in the Floras the tendency of which has been obvious to all who have pa the slightest attention to the progress of affairs in that quarter. Throughout the whole of those Provinces to which the Spanish title extends the Government of Spain has scarcely been felt. Its authority has been confined almost exclusively to the walls of Pensacola and St. Augustine within which only small garrisons have been maintained. Adventurers from every country fugitives from justice and absconding slaves have found an asylum there. Several tribes of Indians strong in the # of their warriors remarkable for their ferocity and whose settlements extend to our limits inhabit those Provinces. These different hordes of people connected together disregarding on the one se the authority of Spain and protected on the other by an imaginary line which separates Flora from the United States have violated our laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves have practiced various frauds on our revenue and committed every kind of outrage on our peaceable citizens which their proximity to us enabled them to perpetrate. The invasion of Amelia Island last year by a small band of adventurers not exceeding 150 in number who wrested it from the inconserable Spanish force stationed there and held it several months during which a single feeble effort only was made to recover it which failed clearly proves how completely extinct the Spanish authority had become as the conduct of those adventurers while in possession of the island as distinctly shows the pernicious purposes for which their combination had been formed. This country had in fact become the theater of every species of lawless adventure. With little population of its own the Spanish authority almost extinct and the colonial governments in a state of revolution having no pretension to it and sufficiently employed in their own concerns it was in great measure derelict and the object of cupity to every adventurer. A system of buccaneering was raply organizing over it which menaced in its consequences the lawful commerce of every nation and particularly the United States while it presented a temptation to every people on whose seduction its success principally depended. In regard to the United States the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination was not confined to the ocean; the Indian tribes have constituted the effective force in Flora. With these tribes these adventurers had formed at an early period a connection with a  to avail themselves of that force to promote their own projects of accumulation and aggrandizement. It is to the interference of some of these adventurers in misrepresenting the claims and titles of the Indians to land and in practicing on their savage propensities that the Seminole war is principally to be traced. Men who thus connect themselves with savage communities and stimulate them to war which is always attended on their part with acts of barbarity the most shocking deserve to be ed in a worse light than the savages. They would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment which according to the rules of warfare practiced by the savages might justly be inflicted on the savages themselves. If the embarrassments of Spain prevented her from making an indemnity to our citizens for so long a time from her treasury for their losses by spoliation and otherwise it was always in her power to have proved it by the cession of this territory. Of this her Government has been repeatedly apprised and the cession was the more to have been anticipated as Spain must have known that in ceding it she would likewise relieve herself from the important obligation secured by the treaty of 1795 and all other compromitments respecting it. If the United States from conseration of these embarrassments declined pressing their claims in a spirit of hostility the motive ought at least to have been duly appreciated by the Government of Spain. It is well known to her Government that other powers have made to the United States an indemnity for like losses sustained by their citizens at the same epoch. There is nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justified. If it was proper to rely on amicable negotiation for an indemnity for losses it would not have been so to have permitted the inability of Spain to fulfill her engagements and to sustain her authority in the Floras to be perverted by foreign adventurers and savages to purposes so destructive to the lives of our fellow citizens and the highest interests of the United States. The right of self defense never ceases. It is among the most sacred and alike necessary to nations and to inuals and whether the attack be made by Spain herself or by those who abuse her power its obligation is not the less strong. The invaders of Amelia Island had assumed a popular and respected title under which they might approach and wound us. As their object was distinctly seen and the duty imposed on the Executive by an existing law was profoundly felt that mask was not permitted to protect them. It was thought incumbent on the United States to suppress the establishment and it was accordingly done. The combination in Flora for the unlawful purposes stated the acts perpetrated by that combination and above all the incitement of the Indians to massacre our fellow citizens of every age and of both sexes merited a like treatment and received it. In pursuing these savages to an imaginary line in the woods it would have been the height of folly to have suffered that line to protect them. Had that been done the war could never cease. Even if the territory had been exclusively that of Spain and her power complete over it we had a right by the law of nations to follow the enemy on it and to subdue him there. But the territory belonged in a certain sense at least to the savage enemy who inhabited it; the power of Spain had ceased to exist over it and protection was sought under her title by those who had committed on our citizens hostilities which she was bound by treaty to have prevented but had not the power to prevent. To have stopped at that line would have given new encouragement to these savages and new vigor to the whole combination existing there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purposes. In suppressing the establishment at Amelia Island no unfriendliness was manifested toward Spain because the post was taken from a force which had wrested it from her. The measure it is true was not adopted in concert with the Spanish Government or those in authority under it because in transactions connected with the war in which Spain and the colonies are engaged it was thought proper in doing justice to the United States to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent parties without consulting or acting in concert with either. It gives me pleasure to state that the Governments of Buenos Ayres and Venezuela whose names were assumed have explicitly disclaimed all participation in those measures and even the knowledge of them until communicated by this Government and have also expressed their satisfaction that a course of proceedings had been suppressed which if justly imputable to them would dishonor their cause. In authorizing MajorGeneral Jackson to enter Flora in pursuit of the Seminoles care was taken not to encroach on the rights of Spain. I regret to have to add that in executing this order facts were disclosed respecting the conduct of the officers of Spain in authority there in encouraging the war furnishing munitions of war and other supplies to carry it on and in other acts not less marked which evinced their participation in the hostile purposes of that combination and justified the confence with which it inspired the savages that by those officers they would be protected. A conduct so incompatible with the friendly relations existing between the two countries particularly with the positive obligations of the 5th article of the treaty of 1795 by which Spain was bound to restrain even by force those savages from acts of hostility against the United States could not fail to excite surprise. The commanding general was convinced that he should fail in his object that he should in effect accomplish nothing if he d not deprive those savages of the resource on which they had calculated and of the protection on which they had relied in making the war. As all the documents relating to this occurrence will be la before Congress it is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it. Although the reasons which induced MajorGeneral Jackson to take these posts were duly appreciated there was nevertheless no hesitation in decing on the course which it became the Government to pursue. As there was reason to believe that the commanders of these posts had violated their instructions there was no disposition to impute to their Government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile. An order was in consequence issued to the general in command there to deliver the posts  Pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorized to receive it and St. Marks which is in the heart of the Indian country on the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savages and their associates. In entering Flora to suppress this combination no ea was entertained of hostility to Spain and however justifiable the commanding general was in consequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers in entering St. Marks and Pensacola to terminate it by proving to the savages and their associates that they should not be protected even there yet the amicable relations existing between the United States and Spain could not be altered by that act alone. By ordering the restitution of the posts those relations were preserved. To a change of them the power of the Executive is deemed incompetent; it is vested in Congress only. By this measure so promptly taken due respect was shown to the Government of Spain. The misconduct of her officers has not been imputed to her. She was enabled to re with candor her relations with the United States and her own situation particularly in respect to the territory in question with the dangers inseparable from it and regarding the losses we have sustained for which indemnity has been so long withheld and the injuries we have suffered through that territory and her means of redress she was likewise enabled to take with honor the course best calculated to do justice to the United States and to promote her own welfare. Copies of the instructions to the commanding general of his correspondence with the Secretary of War explaining his motives and justifying his conduct with a copy of the proceedings of the courts martial in the trial of Arbuthnot and Ambristie and of the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister plenipotentiary of Spain near this Government and of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madr with the Government of Spain will be la before Congress. The civil war which has so long prevailed between Spain and the Provinces in South America still continues without any prospect of its speedy termination. The information respecting the condition of those countries which has been collected by the commissioners recently returned from thence will be la before Congress in copies of their reports with such other information as has been received from other agents of the United States. It appears from these communications that the Government at Buenos Ayres declared itself independent in 1816 July having previously exercised the power of an independent Government though in the name of the King of Spain from the year 1810; that the Banda Oriental Entre Rios and Paraguay with the city of Santa Fee all of which are also independent are unconnected with the present Government of Buenos Ayres; that Chili has declared itself independent and is closely connected with Buenos Ayres; that Venezuela has also declared itself independent and now maintains the conflict with various success; and that the remaining parts of South America except Monte Veo and such other portions of the eastern bank of the La Plata as are held by Portugal are still in the possession of Spain or in a certain degree under her influence. By a circular note addressed by the ministers of Spain to the allied powers with whom they are respectively accredited it appears that the allies have undertaken to mediate between Spain and the South American Provinces and that the manner and extent of their interposition would be settled by a congress which was to have met at AixlaChapelle in September last. From the general policy and course of proceeding observed by the allied powers in regard to this contest it is inferred that they will confine their interposition to the expression of their sentiments abstaining from the application of force. I state this impression that force will not be applied with the greater satisfaction because it is a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorizes a hope that the calamities of the war will be confined to the parties only and will be of shorter duration. From the  taken of this subject founded on all the information that we have been able to obtain there is good cause to be satisfied with the course heretofore pursued by the United States in regard to this contest and to conclude that it is proper to adhere to it especially in the present state of affairs. I have great satisfaction in stating that our relations with France Russia and other powers continue on the most friendly basis. In our domestic concerns we have ample cause of satisfaction. The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded $17M. After satisfying all the demands which have been made under existing appropriations including the final extinction of the old 6% stock and the redemption of a moiety of the Louisiana debt it is estimated that there will remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January next more than $2M. It is ascertained that the gross revenue which has accrued from the customs during the same period amounts to $21M and that the revenue of the whole year may be estimated at not less than $26M. The sale of the public lands during the year has also greatly exceeded both in quantity and price that of any former year and there is just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue. It is gratifying to know that although the annual expenditure has been increased by the act of the last session of Congress proving for Revolutionary pensions to an amount about equal to the proceeds of the internal duties which were then repealed the revenue for the ensuing year will be proportionally augmented and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary each successive year will add to the national resources by the ordinary increase of our population and by the gradual development of our latent sources of national prosperity. The strict execution of the revenue laws resulting principally from the salutary provisions of the act of the 20th of April last amending the several collection laws has it is presumed secured to domestic manufactures all the relief that can be derived from the duties which have been imposed upon foreign merchandise for their protection. Under the influence of this relief several branches of this important national interest have assumed greater activity and although it is hoped that others will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle yet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your conseration. The measures of defense authorized by existing laws have been pursued with the zeal and activity due to so important an object and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking. The survey of our maritime and inland frontiers has been continued and at the points where it was deced to erect fortifications the work has been commenced and in some instances conserable progress has been made. In compliance with resolutions of the last session the Board of Commissioners were directed to examine in a particular manner the parts of the coast therein designated and to report their opinion of the most suitable sites for two al depots. This work is in a train of execution. The opinion of the Board on this subject with a plan of all the works necessary to a general system of defense so far as it has been formed will be la before Congress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be prepared. In conformity with the appropriations of the last session treaties have been formed with the Quapaw tribe of Indians inhabiting the country on the Arkansaw and the Great and Little Osages north of the White River; with the tribes in the State of Indiana; with the several tribes within the State of Ohio and the Michigan Territory and with the Chickasaws by which very extensive cessions of territory have been made to the United States. Negotiations are now depending with the tribes in the Illinois Territory and with the Choctaws by which it is expected that other extensive cessions will be made. I take great interest in stating that the cessions already made which are consered so important to the United States have been obtained on conditions very satisfactory to the Indians. With a  to the security of our inland frontiers it has been thought expedient to establish strong posts at the mouth of Yellow Stone River and at the Mandan village on the Missouri and at the mouth of St. Peters on the Mississippi at no great distance from our northern boundaries. It can hardly be presumed while such posts are maintained in the rear of the Indian tribes that they will venture to attack our peaceable inhabitants. A strong hope is entertained that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribes themselves especially in promoting the great object of their civilization. Experience has clearly demonstrated that independent savage communities can not long exist within the limits of a civilized population. The progress of the latter has almost invariably terminated in the extinction of the former especially of the tribes belonging to our portion of this hemisphere among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have been conspicuous. To civilize them and even to prevent their extinction it seems to be indispensable that their independence as communities should cease and that the control of the United States over them should be complete and undisputed. The hunter state will then be more easily abandoned and recourse will be had to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuits tending to dissolve the ties which connect them together as a savage community and to give a new character to every inual. I present this subject to the conseration of Congress on the presumption that it may be found expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provisions having these objects in  relative to the tribes within our settlements. It has been necessary during the present year to maintain a strong al force in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico and to send some public ships along the southern coast and to the Pacific Ocean. By these means amicable relations with the Barbary Powers have been preserved our commerce has been protected and our rights respected. The augmentation of our Navy is advancing with a steady progress toward the limit cond by law. I communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another State (Illinois) to our Union because I perceive from the proof afforded by the additions already made the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history affords no example and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimated. By extending our Government on the principles of our Constitution over the vast territory within our limits on the Lakes and the Mississippi and its numerous streams new life and vigor are infused into every part of our system. By increasing the number of the States the confence of the State governments in their own security is increased and their jealousy of the National Government proportionally diminished. The impracticability of one consolated Government for this great and growing nation will be more apparent and will be universally admitted. Incapable of exercising local authority except for general purposes the General Government will no longer be dreaded. In those cases of a local nature and for all the great purposes for which it was instituted its authority will be cherished. Each Government will acquire new force and a greater freedom of action within its proper sphere. Other inestimable advantages will follow. Our produce will be augmented to an incalculable amount in articles of the greatest value for domestic use and foreign commerce. Our igation will in like degree be increased and as the shipping of the Atlantic States will be employed in the transportation of the vast produce of the Western country even those parts of the United States which are most remote from each other will be further bound together by the strongest ties which mutual interest can create. The situation of this District it is thought requires the attention of Congress. By the Constitution the power of legislation is exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States. In the exercise of this power in which the people have no participation Congress legislate in all cases directly on the local concerns of the District. As this is a departure for a special purpose from the general principles of our system it may merit conseration whether an arrangement better adapted to the principles of our Government and to the particular interests of the people may not be devised which will neither infringe the Constitution nor affect the object which the provision in question was intended to secure. The growing population already conserable and the increasing business of the District which it is believed already interferes with the deliberations of Congress on great national concerns furnish additional motives for recommending this subject to your conseration. When we  the great blessings with which our country has been favored those which we now enjoy and the means which we possess of handing them down unimpaired to our latest posterity our attention is irresistibly drawn to the source from whence they flow. Let us then unite in offering our most grateful acknowledgments for these blessings to the Divine Author of All Good.
