            "['To the House of Representatives: The following Joint resolution restoring Tennessee to her relations in the Union was last evening presented for my approval: Whereas in the year 1861 the government of the State of Tennessee was seized upon and taken possession of by persons in hostility to the United States and the inhabitants of sa State in pursuance of an act of Congress were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the United States: and Whereas sa State government can only be restored to its former political relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United States: and Whereas the people of sa State d on the 22d day of February 1865 by a large popular vote adopt and ratify a constitution of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared vo; and Whereas a State government has been organized under sa constitution which has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery also the amendment proposed by the Thirtyninth Congress and has done other acts proclaiming and denoting loyalty: Therefore Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled That the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations to the Union and is again entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in Congress. The preamble simply consists of statements some of which are assumed while the resolution is merely a declaration of opinion. It comprises no legislation nor does it confer any power which is binding upon the respective Houses the Executive or the States. It does not admit to their seats in Congress the Senators and Representatives from the State of Tennessee for notwithstanding the passage of the resolution each House in the exercise of the constitutional right to judge for itself of the elections returns and qualifications of its members may at its discretion admit them or continue to exclude them. If a joint resolution of this kind were necessary and binding as a condition precedent to the admission of members of Congress it would happen in the event of a veto by the Executive that Senators and Representatives could only be admitted to the halls of legislation by a twothirds vote of each of the Houses. Among other reasons recited in the preamble for the declaration contained in the resolution is the ratification by the State government of Tennessee of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery also the amendment proposed by the Thirtyninth Congress. if as is also declared in the preamble sa State government can only be restored to its former political relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the United States it would really seem to follow that the joint resolution which at this late day has received the sanction of Congress should have been passed approved and placed on the statute books before any amendment to the Constitution was submitted to the legislature of Tennessee for ratification. Otherwise the inference is plainly deducible that while in the opinion of Congress the people of a State may be too strongly disloyal to be entitled to representation they may nevertheless during the suspension of their former proper practical relations to the Union have an equally potent voice with other and loyal States in propositions to amend the Constitution upon which so essentially depend the stability prosperity and very existence of the nation. A brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of December last will show the steps taken by the Executive for the restoration to their constitutional relations to the Union of the States that had been affected by the rebellion. Upon the cessation of active hostilities provisional governors were appointed conventions called governors elected by the people legislatures assembled and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States. At the same time the courts of the United States were reopened the ade removed the customhouses reestablished and postal operations resumed. The amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery forever within the limits of the country was also submitted to the States and they were thus invited to and d participate in its ratification thus exercising the highest s pertaining to a State. In addition nearly all of these States through their conventions and legislatures had adopted and ratified constitutions of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared vo. So far then the political existence of the States and their relations to the Federal Government had been fully and completely recognized and acknowledged by the executive department of the Government; and the completion of the work of restoration which had progressed so favorably was submitted to Congress upon which devolved all questions pertaining to the admission to their seats of the Senators and Representatives chosen from the States whose people had engaged in the rebellion. All these steps had been taken when on the 4th day of December 1865 the Thirtyninth Congress assembled. Nearly eight months have elapsed since that time; and no other plan of restoration having been proposed by Congress for the measures instituted by the Executive it is now declared in the joint resolution submitted for my approval that the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations to the Union and is again entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in Congress. Thus after the lapse of nearly eight months Congress proposes to pave the way to the admission to representation of one of the eleven States whose people arrayed themselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority of the Federal Government. Earnestly desiring to remove every cause of further delay whether real or imaginary on the part of Congress to the admission to seats of loyal Senators and Representatives from the State of Tennessee I have notwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding affixed my signature to the resolution. My approval however is not to be construed as an acknowledgment of the right of Congress to pass laws preliminary to the admission of duly qualified Representatives from any of the States. Neither is it to be consered as committing me to all the statements made in the preamble some of which are in my opinion without foundation in fact especially the assertion that the State of Tennessee has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed by the Thirtyninth Congress. No official notice of such ratification has been received by the Executive or filed in the Department of State; on the contrary unofficial information from the most reliable sources induces the belief that the amendment has not yet been constitutionally sanctioned by the legislature of Tennessee. The right of each House under the Constitution to judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members is undoubted and my approval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the slightest degree increase or diminish the authority in this respect conferred upon the two branches of Congress. In conclusion I can not too earnestly repeat my recommendation for the admission of Tennessee and all other States to a fair and equal participation in national legislation when they present themselves in the persons of loyal Senators and Representatives who can comply with all the requirements of the Constitution and the laws. By this means harmony and reconciliation will be effected the practical relations of all the States to the Federal Government reestablished and the work of restoration inaugurated upon the termination of the war successfully completed. ', \"reach an agreement as early as possible. As soon as I learned that the Panamanians had marched on our zone and we had a disturbance there and some of our soldiers had been killed some of the students had raised the flag and this disturbance had resulted I immediately called the Present of Panama on the telephone and sa to him in that first exchange I want to do everything I can to work this problem out peacefully and quickly. Therefore our people will meet with your people any time anywhere to discuss anything that will result in bringing peace and stopping violence. The Present asked me how long it would be before those discussions could take place and I sa we would have a team in the air within 30 minutes. I designated Assistant Secretary Mann to leave immediately. We have been pursuing those discussions ever since. We have reached no agreement. One day you see speculation that an agreement is imminent. The next day you see speculation that we are very pessimistic. I think both reports have been wrong. There has been no meeting of the minds. We realize that treaties were written in 1903 and modified from time to timethat problems are involved that need to be dealt with and perhaps would require adjustment in the treaty in 1963 or 1964. So we are not refusing to discuss and evolve a program that will be fair and just to all concerned. But we are not going to make any precommitments before we sit down on what we are going to do in the way of rewriting new treaties with a nation that we do not have diplomatic relations with. Once those relations are restored we will be glad as I sa the first day and as we have repeated every day since to discuss anything any time anywhere and do what is just and what is fair and what is right. Just because Panama happens to be a small nation maybe no larger than the city of St. Louis is no reason why we shouldn't try in every way to be equitable and fair and just. We are going to insist on that. But we are going to be equally insistent on no preconditions. Q. Mr. Present returning to southeast Asia the Pathet Lao in Laos has been stepping up its military activities in violation of the '62 Geneva agreement. Is the United States willing to concede that neutralization is not the answer to Laos today? THE PRESIDENT. The United States has made the proper protestations and is doing everything we can to see that that agreement reached is carried out. We have expressed our deep regret that it has not been. We are very hopeful that the interested governments will take the appropriate action to see that the agreement is carried out. Q. Mr. Present you have sa repeatedly that peace is the paramount issue on your mind. I wonder sir if during your first hundred days in the White House you have seen any encouraging signs along this road and specifically do you think a trend of the modern world is towards coexistence and conciliation rather than to strife. THE PRESIDENT. We must be concerned not just with our foreign policy in the twentieth century but with the foreign policy of 110 or 120 other nations. We are today dealing with serious problems in many places in the world that seriously affect the peace. When we solve these problems I have no doubt but what there will be others that arise that have been in existence for centuries. It is going to be the course of this Government to do everything that we can to resolve these differences peacefully even though they are not of our own making. There are few of these situations which have been brought about by anything that we have done but they are ageold differences that have existed for centuries. I am an optimist. I spent 35 days in meetings with the Security Council in the Cuban missile crisis. I saw the alternatives presented there. I realized that we can with the great power we have perhaps destroy 100 million people in a matter of minutes and our adversaries can do likewise. I don't think that the people of the world want that to happen and I think we are going to do everything that we can to avo its happening. Now there are going to be some very serious problems that we have to resolve before we achieve peace in the world if we achieve it completely but we are going to continue to try to resolve them. I am encouraged and I am not pessimistic about the future. I believe that we have adequate machinery to deal with these problems and I sincerely and genuinely believe that the people of the world want peace more than they want anything else and that in time through their leaders someway somehow we will find the answer. Q. Mr. Present some reference was made to your first hundred days. How do you size up your first hundred days generally? THE PRESIDENT. Well I have been reasonably close to the Presency during the 30 years that I have been in Washington particularly the last 3 years. But I have gotten many different impressions in the last hundred days than I had before I came to this awesome responsibility. I am deeply impressed by the spirit of unity in this country by the many people of all faiths and all sections who closed ranks and were anxious to unite the country following the tragic affair of last November. I am quite pleased with the manner in which the executive personnel has carried on following the death of their great leader how the Cabinet has ed to a man in this crisis. I think the continuity and the transition and the organization of the budget and the various messages and the outline of the program has created confence in the country and in the world. I am pleased with what the Congress has done in the field of passing 10 of the 15 appropriations bills in the first hundred days that were carried over from last year and in passing the education bills that made this Congress known as the greatest education Congress in the history of our land; in the passage of the civil rights bill in the House of Representatives after it had been consered there for some 6 or 7 months; in the passage of the tax bill in the United States Senate after it had been there almost 13 months and now finally enacted into law. While I have been lavishly praised by some and I think lavishly criticized by some I think generally speaking the American Nation has conducted itself as you would expect it to in a crisis and would get very good grades. Insofar as I am concerned I am rather pleased with what has been accomplished in the first hundred days as a result of men and women of good will working together. Q. Mr. Present a political question sir. Present Kennedy told us that he would be willing to debate his Republican opponent in this coming election had he lived. Would you be willing to do that sir? THE PRESIDENT. Well I haven't been nominated yet. I think we will have plenty of time to dece that one after the convention. I will cross that brge when I come to it. Q. Mr. Present next month in Geneva a world trade conference will be started organized by the United Nations and more than 100 countries will participate in it. The other day Senator Fulbright sa that he is going to have hearings in his committee on world trade. Would you tell us what is your attitude toward the developing of world trade? THE PRESIDENT. We are very interested in that conference. We are going to participate in it and make every contribution we can. We think it is essential in the interest of the peoples of the world that trade barriers be pulled down. And we are going to contribute everything we can to that end. Q. Mr. Present I have seen speculation in print that it is your guess that you will run against Richard Nixon. Is that true? If it is not true can you tell us what your guess is in that respect sir? THE PRESIDENT. I dn't get the first part of your question. Q. I have read in print speculation that you expect that you will be running against Richard Nixon next year. THE PRESIDENT. No I haven't speculated on whether I will run or even who I will run against if I do run. That is a matter for the conventions of the two parties to determine when the delegates are properly chosen and they act. All I know about who may be interested in the job is from what I see in the papers and the activities of the various inuals. Q. Mr. Present the American Ambassador from Cyprus has been recalled for consultations. Could you give us your s on the Cyprus matter please? THE PRESIDENT. We are deeply concerned with it. We think it is a very serious situation. We sent our Under Secretary the very able George Ball across the water to talk to the people in Cyprus and the people in Turkey and the people in Greece and the 'people in Great Britain and the guarantor powers. We felt that we should make every possible effort to resolve these differences and to avo more serious consequences. The matter is now pending in the United Nations and we are doing our deadlevel best to find the solution. We are concerned as it is extremely serious but we believe that it will be resolved and we certainly hope so. Q. Mr. Present yesterday the Commerce Department without advance notice put lard an important staple in the diet of the Cuban people on the embargoed list. Could you tell us if you gave the order to put that commodity on the list and if so was your action the result of a telegram from Congressman Paul Findley of Illinois and a Senate speech by Senator Keating? THE PRESIDENT. Yesterday just before lunch I was informed that the Commerce Department was giving conseration to adding lard to that list. Rumors had been circulating in the trade for a few hours that it was expected that there would be a huge sale of lard involved and my judgment was requested. I concurred in the judgment of the Commerce Department that before a license was issued we should carefully conser what we were doing and that if the rumors were true the matter needed further attention. Now we have no evence that these rumors are going to develop into facts but if they do the Commerce Department will judicially examine all the facts and make a determination that justifies our Government acting in our national interests. Now what action it will take will be determined after the case is heard if the rumors and speculation seem to be true. Q. Mr. Present would it be your policy to go to the people to explain administrative policy to explain to them by radio and television in the firesechat tradition? THE PRESIDENT. I think the Present has a responsibility to do the very best job he can as Present for all the people. I think in order to do that it is important for the people to know the problems that confront him. Man's judgment on any given question is no better than the facts he has on that question. So I go along with the  expressed by Jefferson that the collective judgment of the many is much to be preferred to the selective decisions of the few. I shall have my Press Secretary hold daily briefings at least two a day and make available all information that can be made available to the press. From time to time I will see inual members of the press about press business and I may see some of my fulltime friends socially occasionally I hope without too much criticism. Other times I will have them in my office if I have any announcements that I think worthy of their attention and taking their time. At other times I will have a meeting like this to reach the folks who the press may not be able to reach through the ordinary newspaper or magazine media so that we can have radio coverage and television coverage. I know of nothing in the Present's job that is more important than being held accountable to the people explaining to the people the reasons for his action and telling the people something about the problems that confront him because they are a very understanding group once they have the facts. Q. Mr. Present there have been rumors particularly from the Republicans that you may be willing to compromise the public accommodations section of the civil rights bill. Is that true and if not is there any part of the bill that you feel might be the subject of compromise? THE PRESIDENT. I have never discussed this with anyone and I would suspect that those rumors which you talk about which I have read about are strictly Republican in origin. I will say that the civil rights bill which passed the House is the bill that this administration recommends. I am in favor of it passing the Senate exactly in its present form. I realize there will be some Senators who will want to strengthen it some who will want to weaken it. But so far as this administration is concerned its position is firm and we stand on the House bill. Q. Mr. Present much of the speculation on VietNam in the past week has been occasioned by that phrase in your speech last weekend about a dangerous game in VietNam. I think many of us are puzzled about what was the intention of that phrase and could you clarify your intentions for us? THE PRESIDENT. The speculation on VietNam has been going on for some time. I was out there in 1961. There was a good deal of speculation then. In my California speech I intended to say just what I d that aggressors who intend to envelop peaceful libertyloving free people and attempt to do so through aggressive means are playing a very dangerous game. That is what I sa that is what I meant and that is a very dangerous situation there and has been for some time. Q. Mr. Present would you further assess the situation in the far East in the light of Mr. Bundy's appointment there and the problems he may face? THE PRESIDENT. We know that we have very serious problems in that area. We want to have the very best people that we can handling those problems. As I told you on. the ground in VietNam we have Ambassador Lodge. has been sent additional assistance since I took office in November and there are several new and very highly competent faces that have gone out at his request and with his approval. Mr. Hilsman felt that he should return to his faculty duties and he submitted his resignation to us. We had a reasonable time to select his successor. We reed the several possible persons to succeed him. We felt Mr. Hilsman was a very able and a very conscientious and very effective public servant and we realized it was difficult to fill his shoes. We finally concluded after conferring with Secretary Rusk at some length that we should ask Secretary McNamara if he would be willing to let Mr. Bundy resign his place under his administration and move over to the State Department to take over Mr. Hilsman's duties. Thorough conseration was given to it and Mr. McNamara reluctantly agreed but d agree and we have been able to prevail upon Mr. Bundy to do that. We think that he is the best possible successor that we could have to Mr. Hilsman and we do think that this whole area needs every bit of the best manpower that it can get. Thank you Mr. Present.           \", \"            Mr. Presentas one who has taken some interest in the election of Presents I want to congratulate you on your election to this high officeMr. Secretary General delegates to the United Nations ladies and gentlemen: We meet again in the quest for peace. Twentyfour months ago when I last had the honor of addressing this body the shadow of fear lay darkly across the world. The freedom of West Berlin was in immediate peril. Agreement on a neutral Laos seemed remote. The mandate of the United Nations in the Congo was under fire. The financial outlook for this organization was in doubt. Dag Hammarskjold was dead. The doctrine of troika was being pressed in his place and atmospheric nuclear tests had been resumed by the Soviet Union. Those were anxious days for mankindand some men wondered aloud whether this organization could survive. But the 16th and 17th General Assemblies achieved not only survival but progress. Rising to its responsibility the United Nations helped reduce the tensions and helped to hold back the darkness. Today the clouds have lifted a little so that new rays of hope can break through. The pressures on West Berlin appear to be temporarily eased. Political unity in the Congo has been largely restored. A neutral coalition in Laos while still in difficulty is at least in being. The integrity of the United Nations Secretariat has been reaffirmed. A United Nations Decade of Development is under way. And for the first time in 17 years of effort a specific step has been taken to limit the nuclear arms race. I refer of course to the treaty to ban nuclear tests in the atmosphere outer space and under waterconcluded by the Soviet Union the United Kingdom and the United Statesand already signed by nearly 100 countries. It has been hailed by people the world over who are thankful to be free from the fears of nuclear fallout and I am confent that on next Tuesday at 10:30 o'clock in the morning it will receive the overwhelming endorsement of the Senate of the United States. The world has not escaped from the darkness. The long shadows of conflict and crisis envelop us still. But we meet today in an atmosphere of rising hope and at a moment of comparative calm. My presence here today is not a sign of crisis but of confence. I am not here to report on a new threat to the peace or new signs of war. I have come to salute the United Nations and to show the support of the American people for your daily deliberations. For the value of this body's work is not dependent on the existence of emergenciesnor can the winning of peace consist only of dramatic victories. Peace is a daily a weekly a monthly process gradually changing opinions slowly eroding old barriers quietly building new structures. And however undramatic the pursuit of peace that pursuit must go on. Today we may have reached a pause in the cold warbut that is not a lasting peace. A test ban treaty is a milestonebut it is not the millennium. We have not been released from our obligationswe have been given an opportunity. And if we fail to make the most of this moment and this momentumif we convert our newfound hopes and understandings into new walls and weapons of hostilityif this .pause in the cold war merely leads to its renewal and not to its endthen the indictment of posterity will rightly point its finger at us all. But if we can stretch this pause into a period of cooperationif both ses can now gain new confence and experience in concrete collaborations for peaceif we can now be as bold and farsighted in the control of deadly weapons as we have been in their creationthen surely this first small step can be the start of a long and fruitful journey. The task of building the peace lies with the leaders of every nation large and small. For the great powers have no monopoly on conflict or ambition. The cold war is not the only expression of tension in this worldand the nuclear race is not the only arms race. Even little wars are dangerous in a nuclear world. The long labor of peace is an undertaking for every nationand in this effort none of us can remain unaligned. To this goal none can be uncommitted. The reduction of global tension must not be an excuse for the narrow pursuit of selfinterest. If the Soviet Union and the United States with all of their global interests and clashing commitments of eology and with nuclear weapons still aimed at each other today can find areas of common interest and agreement then surely other nations can do the samenations caught in regional conflicts in racial issues or in the death throes of old colonialism. Chronic disputes which ert precious resources from the needs of the people or drain the energies of both ses serve the interests of no oneand the badge of responsibility in the modern world is a willingness to seek peaceful solutions. It is never too early to try; and it's never too late to talk; and it's high time that many disputes on the agenda of this Assembly were taken off the debating schedule and placed on the negotiating table. The fact remains that the United States as a major nuclear power does have a special responsibility in the world. It is in fact a threefold responsibilitya responsibility to our own citizens; a responsibility to the people of the whole world who are affected by our decisions; and to the next generation of humanity. We believe the Soviet Union also has these special responsibilitiesand that those responsibilities require our two nations to concentrate less on our differences and more on the means of resolving them peacefully. For too long both of us have increased our military budgets our nuclear stockpiles and our capacity to destroy all life on this hemispherehuman animal vegetablewithout any corresponding increase in our security. Our conflicts to be sure are real. Our concepts of the world are different. No service is performed by failing to make clear our disagreements. A central difference is the belief of the American people in selfdetermination for all people. We believe that the people of Germany and Berlin must be free to reunite their capital and their country. We believe that the people of Cuba must be free to secure the fruits of the revolution that have been betrayed from within and exploited from without. In short we believe that all the worldin Eastern Europe as well as Western in Southern Africa as well as Northern in old nations as well as newthat people must be free to choose their own future without discrimination or dictation without coercion or subversion. These are the basic differences between the Soviet Union and the United States and they cannot be concealed. So long as they exist they set limits to agreement and they forb the relaxation of our vigilance. Our defense around the world will be maintained for the protection of freedomand our determination to safeguard that freedom will measure up to any threat or challenge. But I would say to the leaders of the Soviet Union and to their people that if either of our countries is to be fully secure we need a much better weapon than the Hbomba weapon better than ballistic missiles or nuclear submarinesand that better weapon is peaceful cooperation. We have in recent years agreed on a limited test ban treaty on an emergency communications link between our capitals on a statement of principles for disarmament on an increase in cultural exchange on cooperation in outer space on the peaceful exploration of the Antarctic and on tempering last year's crisis over Cuba. I believe therefore that the Soviet Union and the United States together with their allies can achieve further agreementsagreements which spring from our mutual interest in avoing mutual destruction. There can be no doubt about the agenda of further steps. We must continue to seek agreements on measures which prevent war by accent or miscalculation. We must continue to seek agreement on safeguards against surprise attack including observation posts at key points. We must continue to seek agreement on further measures to curb the nuclear arms race by controlling the transfer of nuclear weapons converting fissionable materials to peaceful purposes and banning underground testing with adequate inspection and enforcement. We must continue to seek agreement on a freer flow of information and people from East to West and West to East. We must continue to seek agreement encouraged by yesterday's affirmative response to this proposal by the Soviet Foreign Minister on an arrangement to keep weapons of mass destruction out of outer space. Let us get our negotiators back to the negotiating table to work out a practicable arrangement to this end. In these and other ways let us move up the steep and difficult path toward comprehensive disarmament securing mutual confence through mutual verification and building the institutions of peace as we dismantle the engines of war. We must not let failure to agree on all points delay agreements where agreement is possible. And we must not put forward proposals for propaganda purposes. Finally in a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special capacityin the field of spacethere is room for new cooperation for further joint efforts in the regulation and exploration of space. I include among these possibilities a joint expedition to the moon. Space offers no problems of sovereignty; by resolution of this Assembly the members of the United Nations have foresworn any claim to territorial rights in outer space or on celestial bodies and declared that international law and the United Nations Charter will apply. Why therefore should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union in preparing for such expeditions become involved in immense duplications of research construction and expenditure? Surely we should explore whether the scientists and astronauts of our two countriesindeed of all the worldcannot work together in the conquest of space sending some day in this decade to the moon not the respresentatives of a single nation but the representatives of all of our countries. All these and other new steps toward peaceful cooperation may be possible. Most of them will require on our part full consultation with our alliesfor their interests are as much involved as our own and we will not make an agreement at their expense. Most of them will require long and careful negotiation. And most of them will require a new approach to the cold wara desire not to bury one's adversary but to compete in a host of peaceful arenas in eas in production and ultimately in service to all mankind. The contest will continuethe contest between those who see a monolithic world and those who believe in ersitybut it should be a contest in leadership and responsibility instead of destruction a contest in achievement instead of intimation. Speaking for the United States of America I welcome such a contest. For we believe that truth is stronger than errorand that freedom is more enduring than coercion. And in the contest for a better life all the world can be a winner. The effort to improve the conditions of man however is not a task for the few. It is the task of all nationsacting alone acting in groups acting in the United Nations for plague and pestilence and plunder and pollution the hazards of nature and the hunger of children are the foes of every nation. The earth the sea and the air are the concern of every nation. And science technology and education can be the ally of every nation. Never before has man had such capacity to control his own environment to end thirst and hunger to conquer poverty and disease to banish illiteracy and massive human misery. We have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the worldor to make it the last. The United States since the close of the war has sent over $100 billion worth of assistance to nations seeking economic viability. And 2 years ago this week we formed a Peace Corps to help interested nations meet the demand for trained manpower. Other industrialized nations whose economies were rebuilt not so long ago with some help from us are now in turn recognizing their responsibility to the less developed nations. The provision of development assistance by inual nations must go on. But the United Nations also must play a larger role in helping bring to all men the fruits of modern science and industry. A United Nations conference on this subject he;d earlier this year at Geneva opened new vistas for the developing countries. Next year a United Nations Conference on Trade will conser the needs of these nations for new markets. And more than fourfifths of the entire United Nations system can be found today mobilizing the weapons of science and technology for the United Nations' Decade of Development. But more can be done. A world center for health communications under the World Health Organization could warn of epemics and the adverse effects of certain drugs as well as transmit the results of new experiments and new discoveries. Regional research centers could advance our common medical knowledge and train new scientists and doctors for new nations. A global system of satellites could prove communication and weather information for all corners of the earth. A worldwe program of conservation could protect the forest and wild game preserves now in danger of extinction for all time improve the marine harvest of food from our oceans and prevent the contamination of air and water by industrial as well as nuclear pollution. And finally a worldwe program of farm productivity and food distribution similar to our country's Food for Peace program could now give every child the food he needs. But man does not live by bread aloneand the members of this organization are committed by the Charter to promote and respect human rights. Those rights are not respected when a Buddhist priest is driven from his pagoda when a synagogue is shut down when a Protestant church cannot open a mission when a Cardinal is forced into hing or when a crowded church service is bombed. The United States of America is opposed to discrimination and persecution on grounds of race and religion anywhere in the world including our own Nation. We are working to right the wrongs of our own country. Through legislation and administrative action through moral and legal commitment this Government has launched a determined effort to r our Nation of discrimination which has existed far too longin education in housing in transportation in employment in the civil service in recreation and in places of public accommodation. And therefore in this or any other forum we do not hesitate to condemn racial or religious injustice whether committed or permitted by friend or foe. I know that some of you have experienced discrimination in this country. But I ask you to believe me when I tell you that this is not the wish of most Americansthat we share your regret and resentmentand that we intend to end such practices for all time to come not only for our visitors but for our own citizens as well. I hope that not only our Nation but all other multiracial societies will meet these standards of fairness and justice. We are opposed to aparthe and all forms of human oppression. We do not advocate the rights of black Africans in order to drive out white Africans. Our concern is the right of all men to equal protection under the lawand since human rights are inisible this body cannot stand ase when those rights are abused and neglected by any member state. New efforts are needed if this Assembly's Declaration of Human Rights now 15 years old is to have full meaning. And new means should be found for promoting the free expression and trade of easthrough travel and communication and through increased exchanges of people and books and broadcasts. For as the world renounces the competition of weapons competition in eas must flourishand that competition must be as full and as fair as possible. The United States delegation will be prepared to suggest to the United Nations initiatives in the pursuit of all the goals. For this is an organization for peaceand peace cannot come without work and without progress. The peacekeeping record of the United Nations has been a proud one though its tasks are always formable. We are fortunate to have the skills of our distinguished Secretary General and the brave efforts of those who have been serving the cause of peace in the Congo in the Mdle East in Korea and Kashmir in West New Guinea and Malaysia. But what the United Nations has done in the past is less important than the tasks for the future. We cannot take its peacekeeping machinery for granted. That machinery must be soundly financedwhich it cannot be if some members are allowed to prevent it from meeting its obligations by failing to meet their own. The United Nations must be supported by all those who exercise their franchise here. And its operations must be backed to the end. Too often a project is undertaken in the excitement of a crisis and then it begins to lose its appeal as the problems drag on and the bills pile up. But we must have the steadfastness to see every enterprise through. It is for example most important not to jeopardize the extraordinary United Nations gains in the Congo. The nation which sought this organization's help only 3 years ago has now asked the United Nations' presence to remain a little longer. I believe this Assembly should do what is necessary to preserve the gains already made and to protect the new nation in its struggle for progress. Let us complete what we have started. For No man who puts his hand to the plow and looks back as the Scriptures tell us No man who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God. I also hope that the recent initiative of several members in preparing standby peace forces for United Nations call will encourage similar commitments by others. This Nation remains ready to prove logistic and other material support. Policing moreover is not enough without provision for pacific settlement. We should increase the resort to special missions of factfinding and conciliation make greater use of the International Court of Justice and accelerate the work of the International Law Commission. The United Nations cannot survive as a static organization. Its obligations are increasing as well as its size. Its Charter must be changed as well as its customs. The authors of that Charter d not intend that it be frozen in perpetuity. The science of weapons and war has made us all far more than 18 years ago in San Francisco one world and one human race with one common destiny. In such a world absolute sovereignty no longer assures us of absolute security. The conventions of peace must pull abreast and then ahead of the inventions of war. The United Nations building on its successes and learning from its failures must be developed into a genuine world security system. But peace does not rest in charters and covenants alone. It lies in the hearts and minds of all people. And if it is east out there then no act no pact no treaty no organization can hope to preserve it without the support and the wholehearted commitment of all people. So let us not rest all our hopes on parchment and on paper; let us strive to build peace a desire for peace a willingness to work for peace in the hearts and minds of all of our people. I believe that we can. I believe the problems of human destiny are not beyond the reach of human beings. Two years ago I told this body that the United States had proposed and was willing to sign a limited test ban treaty. Today that treaty has been signed. It will not put an end to war. It will not remove basic conflicts. It will not secure freedom for all. But it can be a lever and Archimedes in explaining the principles of the lever was sa to have declared to his friends: Give me a place where I can standand I shall move the world. My fellow inhabitants of this planet: Let us take our stand here in this Assembly of nations. And let us see if we in our own time can move the world to a just and lasting peace.         \", \"t of his visit entirely defeated would under the circumstances in which the commander of the Cyane found himself have been absolute abandonment of all claim of our citizens for indemnification and submissive acquiescence in national indignity. It would have encouraged in these lawless men a spirit of insolence and rapine most dangerous to the lives and property of our citizens at Punta Arenas and probably emboldened them to grasp at the treasures and valuable merchandise continually passing over the Nicaragua route. It certainly would have been most satisfactory to me if the objects of the Cyane's mission could have been consummated without any act of public force but the arrogant contumacy of the offenders rendered it impossible to avo the alternative either to break up their establishment or to leave them impressed with the ea that they might persevere with impunity in a career of insolence and plunder.This transaction has been the subject of complaint on the part of some foreign powers and has been characterized with more of harshness than of justice. If comparisons were to be instituted it would not be difficult to present repeated instances in the history of states standing in the very front of modern civilization where communities far less offending and more defenseless than Greytown have been chastised with much greater severity and where not cities only have been la in ruins but human life has been recklessly sacrificed and the blood of the innocent made profusely to mingle with that of the guilty.Passing from foreign to domestic affairs your attention is naturally directed to the financial condition of the country always a subject of general interest. For complete and exact information regarding the finances and the various branches of the public service connected therewith I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury from which it will appear that the amount of revenue during the last fiscal year from all sources was $73549705 and that the public expenditures for the same period exclusive of payments on account of the public debt amounted to $51 018249. During the same period the payments made in redemption of the public debt including interest and premium amounted to $24336380. To the sum total of the receipts of that year is to be added a balance remaining in the Treasury at the commencement thereof amounting to $21942892; and at the close of the same year a corresponding balance amounting to $20137967 of receipts above expenditures also remained in the Treasury. Although in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury the receipts of the current fiscal year are not likely to equal in amount those of the last yet they will undoubtedly exceed the amount of expenditures by at least $15000000. I shall therefore continue to direct that the surplus revenue be applied so far as it can be judiciously and economically done to the reduction of the public debt the amount of which at the commencement of the last fiscal year was $67340628; of which there had been pa on the 20th day of November 1854 the sum of $22365172 leaving a balance of outstanding public debt of only $44975456 redeemable at different periods within fourteen years. There are also remnants of other Government stocks most of which are already due and on which the interest has ceased but which have not yet been presented for payment amounting to $233179. This statement exhibits the fact that the annual income of the Government greatly exceeds the amount of its public debt which latter remains unpa only because the time of payment has not yet matured and it can not be discharged at once except at the option of public creditors who prefer to retain the securities of the United States; and the other fact not less striking that the annual revenue from all sources exceeds by many millions of dollars the amount needed for a prudent and economical administration of the Government.The estimates presented to Congress from the different Executive Departments at the last session amounted to $38406581 and the appropriations made to the sum of $58116958. Of this excess of appropriations over estimates however more than twenty millions was applicable to extraordinary objects having no reference to the usual annual expenditures. Among these objects was embraced ten millions to meet the third article of the treaty between the United States and Mexico; so that in fact for objects of ordinary expenditure the appropriations were limited to conserably less than $40000000. I therefore renew my recommendation for a reduction of the duties on imports. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury presents a series of tables showing the operation of the revenue system for several successive years; and as the general principle of reduction of duties with a  to revenue and not protection may now be regarded as the settled policy of the country I trust that little difficulty will be encountered in settling the details of a measure to that effect.In connection with this subject I recommend a change in the laws which recent experience has shown to be essential to the protection of the Government. There is no express provision of law requiring the records and papers of a public character of the several officers of the Government to be left in their offices for the use of their successors nor any provision declaring it felony on their part to make false entries in the books or return false accounts. In the absence of such express provision by law the outgoing officers in many instances have claimed and exercised the right to take into their own possession important books and papers on the ground that these were their private property and have placed them beyond the reach of the Government. Conduct of this character brought in several instances to the notice of the present Secretary of the Treasury naturally awakened his suspicion and resulted in the disclosure that at four portsnamely Oswego Toledo Sandusky and Milwaukeethe Treasury had by false entries been defrauded within the four years next preceding March 1853 of the sum of $198000. The great difficulty with which the detection of these frauds has been attended in consequence of the abstraction of books and papers by the retiring officers and the facility with which similar frauds in the public service may be perpetrated render the necessity of new legal enactments in the respects above referred to quite obvious. For other material modifications of the revenue laws which seem to me desirable I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. That report and the tables which accompany it furnish ample proofs of the sol foundation on which the financial security of the country rests and of the salutary influence of the independenttreasury system upon commerce and all monetary operations.The experience of the last year furnishes additional reasons I regret to say of a painful character for the recommendation heretofore made to prove for increasing the military force employed in the Territory inhabited by the Indians. The settlerson the frontier have suffered much from the incursions of predatory bands and large parties of emigrants to our Pacific possessions have been massacred with impunity. The recurrence of such scenes can only be prevented by teaching these wild tribes the power of and their responsibility to the United States. From the garrisons of our frontier posts it is only possible to detach troops in small bodies; and though these have on all occasions displayed a gallantry and a stern devotion to duty which on a larger field would have commanded universal admiration they have usually suffered severely in these conflicts with superior numbers and have sometimes been entirely sacrificed. All the disposable force of the Army is already employed on this service and is known to be wholly inadequate to the protection which should be afforded. The public mind of the country has been recently shocked by savage atrocities committed upon defenseless emigrants and border settlements and hardly less by the unnecessary destruction of valuable lives where inadequate detachments of troops have undertaken to furnish the needed a. Without increase of the military force these scenes will be repeated it is to be feared on a larger scale and with more disastrous consequences. Congress I am sure will perceive that the plainest duties and responsibilities of Government are involved in this question and I doubt not that prompt action may be confently anticipated when delay must be attended by such fearful hazards.The bill of the last session proving for an increase of the pay of the rank and file of the Army has had beneficial results not only in facilitating enlistments but in obvious improvement in the  of men who enter the service. I regret that corresponding conseration was not bestowed on the officers who in  of their character and services and the expenses to which they are necessarily subject receive at present what is in my judgment inadequate compensation.The valuable services constantly rendered by the Army and its inestimable importance as the nucleus around which the volunteer forces of the nation can promptly gather in the hour of danger sufficiently attest the wisdom of maintaining a military peace establishment; but the theory of our system and the wise practice under it require that any proposed augmentation in time of peace be only commensurate with our extended limits and frontier relations. While scrupulously adhering to this principle I find in existing circumstances a necessity for increase of our military force and it is believed that four new regiments two of infantry and two of mounted men will be sufficient to meet the present exigency. If it were necessary carefully to weigh the cost in a case of such urgency it would be shown that the additional expense would be comparatively light.With the increase of the numerical force of the Army should I think be combined certain measures of reform in its organic arrangement and administration. The present organization is the result of partial legislation often directed to special objects and interests; and the laws regulating rank and command having been adopted many years ago from the British code are not always applicable to our service. It is not surprising therefore that the system should be deficient in the symmetry and simplicity essential to the harmonious working of its several parts and require a careful revision.The present organization by maintaining large staff corps or departments separates many officers from that close connection with troops and those active duties in the field which are deemed requisite to qualify them for the varied responsibilities of high command. Were the duties of the Army staff mainly discharged by officers detached from their regiments it is believed that the special service would be equally well performed and the discipline and instruction of the Army be improved. While due regard to the security of the rights of officers and to the nice sense of honor which should be cultivated among them would seem to exact compliance with the established rule of promotion in ordinary cases still it can hardly be doubted that the range of promotion by selection which is now practically confined to the grade of general officers might be somewhat extended with benefit to the public service. Observance of the rule of seniority sometimes leads especially in time of peace to the promotion of officers who after meritorious and even distinguished service may have been rendered by age or infirmity incapable of performing active duty and whose advancement therefore would tend to impair the efficiency of the Army. Suitable provision for this  of officers by the creation of a retired list would remedy the evil without wounding the just pre of men who by past services have established a claim to high conseration. In again commending this measure to the favorable conseration of Congress I would suggest that the power of placing officers on the retired list be limited to one year. The practical operation of the measure would thus be tested and if after the lapse of years there should be occasion to renew the provision it can be reproduced with any improvements which experience may indicate. The present organization of the artillery into regiments is liable to obvious objections. The service of artillery is that of batteries and an organization of batteries into a corps of artillery would be more consistent with the nature of their duties. A large part of the troops now called artillery are and have been on duty as infantry the distinction between the two arms being merely nominal. This nominal artillery in our service is disproportionate to the whole force and greater than the wants of the country demand. I therefore commend the discontinuance of a distinction which has no foundation in either the arms used or the character of the service expected to be performed.In connection with the proposition for the increase of the Army I have presented these suggestions with regard to certain measures of reform as the complement of a system which would produce the happiest results from a given expenditure and which I hope may attract the early attention and be deemed worthy of the approval of Congress.The recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy having reference to more ample provisions for the discipline and general improvement in the character of seamen and for the reorganization and gradual increase of the Navy I deem eminently worthy of your favorable conseration. The principles which have controlled our policy in relation to the permanent military force by sea and land are sound consistent with the theory of our system and should by no means be disregarded. But limiting the force to the objects particularly set forth in the preceding part of this message we should not overlook the present magnitude and prospective extension of our commercial marine nor fail to give due weight to the fact that beses the 2000 miles of Atlantic seaboard we have now a Pacific coast stretching from Mexico to the British possessions in the north teeming with wealth and enterprise and demanding the constant presence of ships of war. The augmentation of the Navy has not kept pace with the duties properly and profitably assigned to it in time of peace and it is inadequate for the large field of its operations not merely in the present but still more in the progressively increasing exigencies of the commerce of the United States. I cordially approve of the proposed apprentice system for our national vessels recommended by the Secretary of the Navy. The occurrence during the last few months of marine disasters of the most tragic nature involving great loss of human life has produced intense emotions of sympathy and sorrow throughout the country. It may well be doubted whether all these calamitous events are wholly attributable to the necessary and inevitable dangers of the sea. The merchants mariners and shipbuilders of the United States are it is true unsurpassed in farreaching enterprise skill intelligence and courage by any others in the world. But with the increasing amount of our commercial tonnage in the aggregate and the larger size and improved equipment of the ships now constructed a deficiency in the supply of reliable seamen begins to be very seriously felt. The inconvenience may perhaps be met in part by due regulation for the introduction into our merchant ships of indented apprentices which while it would afford useful and eligible occupation to numerous young men would have a tendency to raise the character of seamen as a . And it is deserving of serious reflection whether it may not be desirable to revise the existing laws for the maintenance of discipline at sea upon which the security of life and property on the ocean must to so great an extent depend. Although much attention has already been given by Congress to the proper construction and arrangement of steam vessels and all passenger ships still it is believed that the resources of science and mechanical skill in this direction have not been exhausted. No good reason exists for the marked distinction which appears upon our statutes between the laws for protecting life and property at sea and those for protecting them on land. In most of the States severe penalties are proved to punish conductors of trains engineers and others employed in the transportation of persons by railway or by steamboats on rivers. Why should not the same principle be applied to acts of insubordination cowardice or other misconduct on the part of masters and mariners producing injury or death to passengers on the high seas beyond the jurisdiction of any of the States and where such delinquencies can be reached only by the power of Congress? The whole subject is earnestly commended to your conseration.The report of the PostmasterGeneral to which you are referred for many interesting details in relation to this important and raply extending branch of the public service shows that the expenditure of the year ending June 30 1854 including $133483 of balance due to foreign offices amounted to $8710907. The gross receipts during the same period amounted to $6955586 exhibiting an expenditure over income of $1755321 and a diminution of deficiency as compared with the last year of $361756. The increase of the revenue of the Department for the year ending June 30 1854 over the preceding year was $970399. No proportionate increase however can be anticipated for the current year in consequence of the act of Congress of June 23 1854 proving for increased compensation to all postmasters. From these statements it is apparent that the PostOffice Department instead of defraying its expenses according to the design at the time of its creation is now and under existing laws must continue to be to no small extent a charge upon the general Treasury. The cost of mail transportation during the year ending June 30 1854 exceeds the cost of the preceding year by $495074. I again call your attention to the subject of mail transportation by ocean steamers and commend the suggestions of the Postmaster General to your early attention.During the last fiscal year 11070935 acres of the public lands have been surveyed and 8190017 acres brought into market. The number of acres sold is 7035735 and the amount received therefor $9285533. The aggregate amount of lands sold located under military scrip and land warrants selected as swamp lands by States and by locating under grants for roads is upward of 23000000 acres. The increase of lands sold over the previous year is about 6000000 acres and the sales during the first two quarters of the current year present the extraordinary result of five and a half millions sold exceeding by nearly 4000000 acres the sales of the corresponding quarters of the last year.The commendable policy of the Government in relation to setting apart public domain for those who have served their country in time of war is illustrated by the fact that since 1790 no less than 30000000 acres have been applied to this object.The suggestions which I submitted in my annual message of last year in reference to grants of land in a of the construction of railways were less full and explicit than the magnitude of the subject and subsequent developments would seem to render proper and desirable. Of the soundness of the principle then asserted with regard to the limitation of the power of Congress I entertain no doubt but in its application it is not enough that the value of lands in a particular locality may be enhanced; that in fact a larger amount of money may probably be received in a given time for alternate sections than could have been realized for all the sections without the impulse and influence of the proposed improvements. A prudent proprietor looks beyond limited sections of his domain beyond present results to the ultimate effect which a particular line of policy is likely to produce upon all his possessions and interests. The Government which is trustee in this matter for the people of the States is bound to take the same wise and comprehensive . Prior to and during the last session of Congress upward of 30000000 acres of land were withdrawn from public sale with a  to applications for grants of this character pending before Congress. A careful re of the whole subject led me to direct that all such orders be abrogated and the lands restored to market and instructions were immediately given to that effect. The applications at the last session cond the construction of more than 5000 miles of road and grants to the amount of nearly 20000000 acres of the public domain. Even admitting the right on the part of Congress to be unquestionable is it quite clear that the proposed grants would be productive of good and not evil? The different projects are confined for the present to eleven States of this Union and one Territory. The reasons assigned for the grants show that it is proposed to put the works speedily in process of construction. When we reflect that since the commencement of the construction of railways in the United States stimulated as they have been by the large ends realized from the earlier works over the great thoroughfares and between the most important points of commerce and population encouraged by State legislation and pressed forward by the amazing energy of private enterprise only 17000 miles have been completed in all the States in a quarter of a century; when we see the crippled condition of many works commenced and prosecuted upon what were deemed to be sound principles and safe calculations; when we con the enormous absorption of capital withdrawn from the ordinary channels of business the extravagant rates of interest at this moment pa to continue operations the bankruptcies not merely in money but in character and the inevitable effect upon finances generally can it be doubted that the tendency is to run to excess in this matter? Is it wise to augment this excess by encouraging hopes of sudden wealth expected to flow from magnificent schemes dependent upon the action of Congress? Does the spirit which has produced such results need to be stimulated or checked? Is it not the better rule to leave all these works to private enterprise regulated and when expedient aed by the cooperation of States? If constructed by private capital the stimulant and the check go together and furnish a salutary restraint against speculative schemes and extravagance. But it is manifest that with the most effective guards there is danger of going too fast and too far. We may well pause before a proposition contemplating a simultaneous movement for the construction of railroads which in extent will equal exclusive of the great Pacific road and all its branches nearly onethird of the entire length of such works now completed in the United States and which can not cost with equipments less than $150000000. The dangers likely to result from combinations of interests of this character can hardly be overestimated. But independently of these conserations where is the accurate knowledge the comprehensive intelligence which shall discriminate between the relative claims of these twenty eight proposed roads in eleven States and one Territory? Where will you begin and where end? If to enable these companies to execute their proposed works it is necessary that the a of the General Government be primarily given the policy will present a problem so comprehensive in its bearings and so important to our political and social wellbeing as to claim in anticipation the severest analysis. Entertaining these s I recur with satisfaction to the experience and action of the last session of Congress as furnishing assurance that the subject will not fail to elicit a careful reexamination and rig scrutiny. It was my intention to present on this occasion some suggestions regarding internal improvements by the General Government which want of time at the close of the last session prevented my submitting on the return to the House of Representatives with objections of the bill entitled An act making appropriations for the repair preservation and completion of certain public works heretofore commenced under the authority of law; but the space in this communication already occupied with other matter of immediate public exigency constrains me to reserve that subject for a special message which will be transmitted to the two Houses of Congress at an early day. The judicial establishment of the United States requires modification and certain reforms in the manner of conducting the legal business of the Government are also much needed; but as I have addressed you upon both of these subjects at length before I have only to call your attention to the suggestions then made.My former recommendations in relation to suitable provision for various objects of deep interest to the inhabitants of the District of Columbia are renewed. Many of these objects partake largely of a national character and are important independently of their relation to the prosperity of the only conserable organized community in the Union entirely unrepresented in Congress.I have thus presented suggestions on such subjects as appear to me to be of particular interest or importance and therefore most worthy of conseration during the short remaining period allotted to the labors of the present Congress.Our forefathers of the thirteen united colonies in acquiring their independence and in rounding this Republic of the United States of America have devolved upon us their descendants the greatest and the most noble trust ever committed to the hands of man imposing upon all and especially such as the public will may have invested for the time being with political s the most sacred obligations. We have to maintain inviolate the great doctrine of the inherent right of popular selfgovernment; to reconcile the largest liberty of the inual citizen with complete security of the public order; to render cheerful obedience to the laws of the land to unite in enforcing their execution and to frown indignantly on all combinations to resist them; to harmonize a sincere and ardent devotion to the institutions of religions faith with the most universal religious toleration; to preserve the rights of all by causing each to respect those of the other; to carry forward every social improvement to the uttermost limit of human perfectibility by the free action of mind upon mind not by the obtrusive intervention of misapplied force; to uphold the integrity and guard the limitations of our organic law; to preserve sacred from all touch of usurpation as the very palladium of our political salvation the reserved rights and powers of the several States and of the people; to cherish with loyal fealty and devoted affection this Union as the only sure foundation on which the hopes of civil liberty rest; to administer government with vigilant integrity and rig economy; to cultivate peace and friendship with foreign nations and to demand and exact equal justice from all but to do wrong to none; to eschew intermeddling with the national policy and the domestic repose of other governments and to repel it from our own; never to shrink from war when the rights and the honor of the country call us to arms but to cultivate in preference the arts of peace seek enlargement of the rights of neutrality and elevate and liberalize the intercourse of nations; and by such just and honorable means and such only whilst exalting the condition of the Republic to assure to it the legitimate influence and the benign authority of a great example amongst all the powers of Christendom.Under the solemnity of these convictions the blessing of Almighty God is earnestly invoked to attend upon your deliberations and upon all the counsels and acts of the Government to the end that with common zeal and common efforts we may in humble submission to the ine will cooperate for the promotion of the supreme good of these United States.\", 'My Countrymen: No one can con current conditions without finding much thatis satisfying and still more that is encouraging. Our own country is leadingthe world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict.Many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years and the secondaryand indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time. But weare beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursuedwhat remedies ought to be applied what actions should be taken for ourdeliverance and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully andconscientiously to adopt these methods of relief. Already we have sufficientlyrearranged our domestic affairs so that confence has returned businesshas revived and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which isgradually reaching into every part of the Nation. Realizing that we cannot live unto ourselves alone we have contributed of our resources andour counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputesamong the European nations. Because of what America is and what Americahas done a firmer courage a higher hope inspires the heart of all humanity. These results have not occurred by mere chance. They have been securedby a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extendingover many generations. We can not continue these brilliant successes inthe future unless we continue to learn from the past. It is necessaryto keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continuallybefore us if we are to have any science of government. If we wish to erectnew structures we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations.We must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in theuniverse and that the essentials of human relationship do not change. Wemust frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our politicalfirmament if we expect to hold a true course. If we examine carefully whatwe have done we can determine the more accurately what we can do. We stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since ournational consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action withan array of force. The old sentiment of detached and dependent coloniesdisappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent Nation. Menbegan to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broaderopportunities of a national constitution. Under the eternal urge of freedomwe became an independent Nation. A little less than 50 years later thatfreedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the worldand guarded supported and secured by the Monroe doctrine. The narrowfringe of States along the Atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers acrossthe hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down thegolden slope to the Pacific. We made freedom a birthright. We extendedour domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interestsand accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty uponless favored peoples. In the defense of our own eals and in the generalcause of liberty we entered the Great War. When victory had been fullysecured we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousnessof duty done. Throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom we havestrengthened our independence. We have been and propose to be more andmore American. We believe that we can best serve our own country and mostsuccessfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to beopenly and candly in tensely and scrupulously American. If we haveany heritage it has been that. If we have any destiny we have found itin that direction. But if we wish to continue to be distinctively American we must continueto make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desiresof a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relationsto pursue a conscientious and religious life. We can not permit ourselvesto be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases. It is not the adjectivebut the substantive which is of real importance. It is not the name ofthe action but the result of the action which is the chief concern. Itwill be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolationor entanglement of pacifists and militarists. The physical configurationof the earth has separated us from all of the Old World but the commonbrotherhood of man the highest law of all our being has united us byinseparable bonds with all humanity. Our country represents nothing butpeaceful intentions toward all the earth but it ought not to fail to maintainsuch a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a greatpeople. It ought to be a balanced force intensely modem capable of defenseby sea and land beneath the surface and in the air. But it should be soconducted that all the world may see in it not a menace but an instrumentof security and peace. This Nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which therights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected. It has never foundthat the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only bya great and threatening array of arms. In common with other nations itis now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendlinessand good will through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance. Wehave never practiced the policy of competitive armaments. We have recentlycommitted ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitationof our sea power. As one result of this our Navy ranks larger in comparisonthan it ever d before. Removing the burden of expense and jealousy whichmust always accrue from a keen rivalry is one of the most effective methodsof diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which arethe most potent means of fomenting war. This policy represents a new departurein the world. It is a thought an eal which has led to an entirely newline of action. It will not be easy to maintain. Some never moved fromtheir old positions some are constantly slipping back to the old waysof thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force.America has taken the lead in this new direction and that lead Americamust continue to hold. If we expect others to rely on our fairness andjustice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice. If we are to judge by past experience there is much to be hoped forin international relations from frequent conferences and consultations.We have before us the beneficial results of the Washington conference andthe various consultations recently held upon European affairs some ofwhich were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we wereactive participants. Even the failures can not but be accounted usefuland an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare. I am stronglyin favor of continuation of this policy whenever conditions are such thatthere is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured. In conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather thana threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse amongnations we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes bymethods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure thatresult. The same conserations should lead to our adherence to the PermanentCourt of International Justice. Where great principles are involved wheregreat movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanityby reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movementstheir actual support we ought not to withhold our own sanction becauseof any small and inessential difference but only upon the ground of themost important and compelling fundamental reasons. We can not barter awayour independence or our sovereignty but we ought to engage in no refinementsof logic no sophistries and no subterfuges to argue away the undoubtedduty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers the power ofits resources and its position of leadership in the world actively andcomprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of theresponsibility of a cand and disinterested attempt at the establishmentof a tribunal for the administration of evenhanded justice between nationand nation. The weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon these of a reign not of force but of law and trial not by battle but byreason. We have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of anyother countries. Especially are we determined not to become implicatedin the political controversies of the Old World. With a great deal of hesitationwe have responded to appeals for help to maintain order protect life anroperty and establish responsible government in some of the small countriesof the Western Hemisphere. Our private citizens have advanced large sumsof money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the Old World.We have not failed nor shall we fail to respond whenever necessary tomitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressednations. These too are requirements which must be met by reason of ourvast powers and the place we hold in the world. Some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formulafor permanent peace. Undoubtedly the clarification of the principles ofinternational law would be helpful and the efforts of scholars to preparesuch a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathyand support. Much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those whoadvocate the outlawing of aggressive war. But all these plans and preparationsthese treaties and covenants will not of themselves be adequate. One ofthe greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which peoplefind themselves subjected. One of the most practical things to be donein the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removedso that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived. There mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by successand prosperity. In the making and financing of such adjustments there isnot only an opportunity but a real duty for America to respond with hercounsel and her resources. Conditions must be proved under which peoplecan make a living and work out of their difficulties. But there is anotherelement more important than all without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace. That element lies in the heart of humanity.Unless the desire for peace be cherished there unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highestdegree all artificial efforts will be in vain. Peace will come when thereis realization that only under a reign of law based on righteousness andsupported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man can therebe any hope of a complete and satisfying life. Parchment will fail thesword will fail it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant. It seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these importantobjects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence.We are not entified with any Old World interests. This position shouldbe made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries.We are at peace with all of them. Our program is never to oppress butalways to assist. But while we do justice to others we must require thatjustice be done to us. With us a treaty of peace means peace and a treatyof amity means amity. We have made great contributions to the settlementof contentious differences in both Europe and Asia. But there is a verydefinite point beyond which we can not go. We can only help those who helpthemselves. Mindful of these limitations the one great duty that standsout requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world. While we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have doneabroad we must remember that our continued success in that direction dependsupon what we do at home. Since its very outset it has been found necessaryto conduct our Government by means of political parties. That system wouldnot have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentallysound and proved the best instrumentalities for the most complete expressionof the popular will. It is not necessary to claim that it has always workeerfectly. It is enough to know that nothing better has been devised. Noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party. There is no salvation in anarrow and bigoted partisanship. But if there is to be responsible partygovernment the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecuring office. Unless those who are elected under the same party designationare willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principles of the party platform the electionis merely a mockery no decision is made at the polls and there is norepresentation of the popular will. Common honesty and good faith withthe people who support a party at the polls require that party when itenters office to assume the control of that portion of the Governmentto which it has been elected. Any other course is bad faith and a violationof the party pledges. When the country has bestowed its confence upon a party by makingit a majority in the Congress it has a right to expect such unity of actionas will make the party majority an effective instrument of government.This Administration has come into power with a very clear and definitemandate from the people. The expression of the popular will in favor ofmaintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive.There was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courtsthat we can conser that issue rejected for some time to come. Likewisethe policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilitiesmet with unmistakable defeat. The people declared that they wanted theirrights to have not a political but a judicial determination and theirindependence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownershipand control of their property not in the Government but in their ownhands. As they always do when they have a fair chance the people demonstratedthat they are sound and are determined to have a sound government. When we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted thepolicy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy inpublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation. The principleinvolved in this effort is that of conservation. The resources of thiscountry are almost beyond computation. No mind can comprehend them. Butthe cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition.Not only those who are now making their tax returns but those who meetthe enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills know by hard experiencewhat this great burden is and what it does. No matter what others may wantthese people want a drastic economy. They are opposed to waste. They knowthat extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of theirlabor. I favor the policy of economy not because I wish to save moneybut because I wish to save people. The men and women of this country whotoil are the ones who bear the cost of the Government. Every dollar thatwe carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager.Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so muchthe more abundant. Economy is ealism in its most practical form. If extravagance were not reflected in taxation and through taxationboth directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people it wouldnot be of so much consequence. The wisest and soundest method of solvingour tax problem is through economy. Fortunately of all the great nationsthis country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy. We do notany longer need wartime revenues. The collection of any taxes which arenot absolutely required which do not beyond reasonable doubt contributeto the public welfare is only a species of legalized larceny. Under thisrepublic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them. The onlyconstitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity. Theproperty of the country belongs to the people of the country. Their titleis absolute. They do not support any privileged ; they do not needto maintain great military forces; they ought not to be burdened with agreat array of public employees. They are not required to make any contributionto Government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess uponthemselves through the action of their own representatives. Whenever taxesbecome burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people; but if they donot act for themselves no one can be very successful in acting for them. The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction when unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living we must havetax reform. The method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business; it ought to encourage it. I am opposed to extremely high ratesbecause they produce little or no revenue because they are bad for thecountry and finally because they are wrong. We can not finance the countrywe can not improve social conditions through any system of injusticeeven if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich. Those who suffer the mostharm will be the poor. This country believes in prosperity. It is absurdto suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous. Thewise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislationis not to destroy those who have already secured success but to createconditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful.The verdict of the country has been given on this question. That verdictstands. We shall do well to heed it. These questions involve moral issues. We need not concern ourselvesmuch about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rightsof persons. Under our institutions their rights are supreme. It is notproperty but the right to hold property both great and small which ourConstitution guarantees. All owners of property are charged with a service.These rights and duties have been revealed through the conscience of societyto have a ine sanction. The very stability of our society rests uponproduction and conservation. For inuals or for governments to wasteand squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard theseobligations. The result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moraldecay. These policies of better international understandings greater economyand lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrialrelations. Under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration anda protective tariff employment is plentiful the rate of pay is highand wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen. Ourtransportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been ableto meet all the requirements of the service. Agriculture has been veryslow in reviving but the price of cereals at last indicates that the dayof its deliverance is at hand. We are not without our problems but our most important problem is notto secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess.Our system of government made up of three separate and independent departmentsour ed sovereignty composed of Nation and State the matchless wisdomthat is enshrined in our Constitution all these need constant effort andtireless vigilance for their protection and support. In a republic the first rule for the guance of the citizen is obedienceto law. Under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject. hasno voice in its making no influence in its administration it does notrepresent him. Under a free government the citizen makes his own lawschooses his own administrators which do represent him. Those who wanttheir rights respected under the Constitution and the law ought to setthe example themselves of observing the Constitution and the law. Whilethere may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times thebarbarian and the defective always violate it. Those who disregard therules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence are not promotingfreedom and independence are not following the path of civilization butare displaying the traits of ignorance of servitude of savagery andtreading the way that leads back to the jungle. The essence of a republic is representative government. Our Congressrepresents the people and the States. In all legislative affairs it isthe natural collaborator with the Present. In spite of all the criticismwhich often falls to its lot I do not hesitate to say that there is nomore independent and effective legislative body in the world. It is andshould be jealous of its prerogative. I welcome its cooperation and expectto share with it not only the responsibility but the credit for our commoneffort to secure beneficial legislation. These are some of the principles which America represents. We have notby any means put them fully into practice but we have strongly signifiedour belief in them. The encouraging feature of our country is not thatit has reached its destination but that it has overwhelmingly expressedits determination to proceed in the right direction. It is true that wecould with profit be less sectional and more national in our thought.It would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorantprejudice with a true and enlightened pre of race. But the last electionshowed that appeals to  and nationality had little effect. We wereall found loyal to a common citizenship. The fundamental precept of libertyis toleration. We can not permit any inquisition either within or withoutthe law or apply any religious test to the holding of office. The mindof America must be forever free. It is in such contemplations my fellow countrymen which are not exhaustivebut only representative that I find ample warrant for satisfaction andencouragement. We should not let the much that is to do obscure the muchwhich has been done. The past and present show faith and hope and couragefully justified. Here stands our country an example of tranquillity athome a patron of tranquillity abroad. Here stands its Government awareof its might but obedient to its conscience. Here it will continue to standseeking peace and prosperity solicitous for the welfare of the wage earnerpromoting enterprise developing waterways and natural resources attentiveto the intuitive counsel of womanhood encouraging education desiringthe advancement of religion supporting the cause of justice and honoramong the nations. America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force.No ambition no temptation lures her to thought of foreign dominions.The legions which she sends forth are armed not with the sword but withthe cross. The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankindis not of human but of ine origin. She cherishes no purpose save tomerit the favor of Almighty God. ', \"< AN EMERGENCY has developed in the last few days which it is my duty to lay before the Senate.< The continued downward movement in the economic life of the country has been particularly accelerated during the past few days and it relates in part definitely to the financial program of the Government. There can be no doubt that superimposed upon other causes the longcontinued delays in the passage of legislation proving for such reduction in expenses and such addition to revenues as would balance the budget together with proposals of projects which would greatly increase governmental expenditures have given rise to doubt and anxiety as to the ability of our Government to meet its responsibilities. These fears and doubts have been foolishly exaggerated in foreign countries. They know from bitter experience that the course of unbalanced budgets is the road of ruin. They do not realize that slow as our processes may be we are determined and have the resources to place the finances of the United States on an unassailable basis.< The immediate result has been to create an entirely unjustified run upon the American dollar from foreign countries and within the past few days despite our national wealth and resources and our unparalleled gold reserves our dollar stands at a serious discount in the markets of the world for the first time in half a century. This can be and must be immediately corrected or the reaction upon our economic situation will be such as to cause great losses to our people and will still further retard recovery. Nor is the confusion in public mind and the rising feeling of doubt and fear confined to foreign countries. It reflects itself directly in diminished economic activity and increased unemployment within our own borders and among our own citizens. There is thus further stress upon already diminished and strained economic life of the country.< No one has a more sympathetic realization than I of the difficulties and complexities of the problem with which the Congress is confronted. The decrease in revenues due to the depression by upwards of $1700 million and the consequent necessity to reduce Government expenditures the sacrifice such reduction calls for from many groups and sections the further sacrifice called for in the distribution of the remaining burden by the imposition of new taxes all constitute a problem which naturally arouses we ergence of sectional interest and inual s. Yet if we are to secure a just distribution of these sacrifices in such fashion as to establish confence in the integrity of the Government we must secure an adjustment of these s to quick and prompt national action directed at one sole purpose that is to unfetter the rehabilitation of industry agriculture and unemployment. The time has come when we must all make sacrifice of some parts of our particular s and bring these dangers and degenerations to halt by expeditious action.< In the stress of this emergency I have conferred with members of both parties of the Senate as to methods by which the strains and stresses could be overcome and the gigantic resources and energies of our people released from the fetters in which they are held. I have felt in the stress of this emergency a grave responsibility rests upon me not only to present the situation to the Senate but to make suggestions as to the basis of adjustment between these s which I hope will lead to early action. And I am addressing myself to the Senate on this occasion as the major questions under conseration are now before this body.< We have three major duties in legislation in order to accomplish our fundamental purposes.< 1. Drastic reduction of expenditures.< 2. Passage of adequate revenue legislation the combination of which with reductions will unquestionably beyond all manner of doubt declare to the world the balancing of the Federal budget and the stabilizing of the American dollar.< 3. Passage of adequate relief legislation to assure the country against distress and to a in employment pending the next session of Congress.< It is essential that when we ask our citizens to undertake the burdens of increased taxation we must give to them evence of reduction of every expenditure not absolutely vital to the immediate conduct of the Government. The executive budget of last December proved for a reduction of expenditures in the next fiscal year over the then estimated expenditures of the current year by about $370 million. I have recommended to the Congress from time to time the necessity for passage of legislation which would give authority for further important reductions in expenditures not possible for conseration by either the Executive or the committees of Congress without such legislation.< An earnest nonpartisan effort was made to secure these purposes in a national economy bill in the House but it largely failed. That subject is under re by the bipartisan committee appointed from the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee and I am informed it has tentatively agreed upon a recommendation which would aggregate savings of $250 million together with a number of undetermined further possibilities. I am not informed as to details of these recommendations although I learn that my own suggestions in many instances have not been accepted. But I do know that the committee has made honest and earnest effort to reach a just reduction in expenditures and I trust therefore that despite any of our inual s or the sacrifice of any group that we can unite in support and expeditious adoption of the committee's conclusions. In addition to the economies which may be brought about through the economy bill the direct reductions of the appropriations committees should increase this figure to at least $400 million not including certain postponements to later deficiency bills. As this sum forms the basis of calculations as to increased taxes necessary it is essential that no matter what the details may be that amount of reduction must be obtained or taxes must be increased to compensate. If this minimum of $400 million is attained by congressional action together with the $369 million effected through executive budget except for amounts already budgeted for public works in a to unemployment and increased costs of veterans we will have reduced expenditures of this Government to the lowest point since 1916.< In the matter of tax legislation we must face the plain and unpalatable fact that due to the degeneration in the economic situation during the past month the estimates of fertility of taxes which have been made from time to time based upon the then current prospects of business must be readjusted to take account of the decreasing business activity and shrinking values. The Finance Committee has been advised that the setbacks of the past month now make it event that if we are to have absolute assurance of the needed income with breadth of base which would make a certainty of the collections we must face additional taxes to those now proposed by the Senate Finance Committee.< I recognize the complaint that estimates of the taxes required and reductions of expenses needed have been repeatedly increased but on the other hand it should be borne in mind that if tax and economy legislation recommended from time to time since last December had been promptly enacted there would have been less degeneration and stagnation in the country. But it is unprofitable to argue any such questions. We must face the situation as it exists today.< In the course of the 6 months during which the revenue bill has been consered in the House and Senate practically every form of tax has been suggested at one time or another many have found their way into the bill later to be rejected. The total amount Congress originally set out to obtain has been gradually whittled down either by actual reductions or degeneration of the situation while needs have increased.< If we examine the major sources of possible increases in taxes now proposed and the nature of taxes already voted it may well be that the income taxes have already been raised to the point of diminishing returns through avoance which will ensue by the use of taxexempt securities and are already so high as to approach the danger point in retardation of enterprise. It is advisable that more relief should be given to earned incomes. Nor will further increase in income tax even including the proposals of Senator Connally 1 cover the gap in our revenues or prove against any failure to reduce expenses to the full amount I have stated. The Senate has already imposed a multitude of specific manufacturers excise taxes on special industries. Some of them appear discriminatory and uncertain in their productivity. I have not and do not favor a general sales tax. It has not been proposed by the Treasury. A sales tax is not however to be confused with an extension of the special manufacturers excise taxes to a general manufacturers excise tax with exemptions of food and clothing. This is an entirely different tax from a socalled sales tax and cannot be pyramed. Even this general manufacturers excise tax has not been proposed by the Treasury although at the time such a tax was unanimously recommended by the Ways and Means Committee of the House representing both political parties and their leaders in the House of Representatives the Secretary of the Treasury accepted it in the hope that immediate passage of the bill would result. In order however to solve our problem and give assurance to the country and the world of the impregnability of the American dollar and that we are ready to meet our emergencies at any sacrifice I have now come to favor an extension for a limited period of the many special excise taxes to a more general manufacturers excise tax and will support the Congress if it should be adopted. Whether this be the course or not some further emergency tax sources should be incorporated in the pending bill.< 1 On May 16 1932 Senator Tom Connally oњ Texas offered an amendment to the revenue bill proving for income taxes ranging up to 55 percent in the highest bracket. The Senate rejected the amendment on May 17.< Our third problem is that of relief. The sharp degeneration has its many reflexes in distress and hardship upon our people. I hold that the maintenance of the sense of inual and personal responsibility of men to their neighbors and the proper separation of s of the Federal and local governments requires the maintenance of the fundamental principle that the obligation of distress rests upon the inuals upon the communities and upon the States. In order however that there may be no failure on the part of any State to meets its obligation in this direction I have after consultation with some of the party leaders on both ses favored authorization to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to loan up to $300 million to State governments where they are unable to finance themselves in provision of relief to distress. Such loans should be made by purchase of State bonds by the Corporation but where States are unable to issue bonds then loans should be made upon application of State authorities and if they are not regularized by the issuance of bonds within a period of 12 to 18 months they should become a charge upon the Federal a funds to which such States may be entitled.< In order to a unemployment and to avo wasteful expansion of public works I have favored an authority to the Reconstruction Corporation to increase its issues of its securities to the maximum of $3 billion in order that it may extend its services both in a to employment and agriculture on a we scale. Under the methods proposed the Corporation is to be: (a) authorized to buy bonds from political subisions or public bodies to a in construction of incomeproducing or selfliquating projects; (b) to make loans to established enterprise upon adequate security for advancement of sound projects that will increase employment but safeguarded by requirement that some portion of outse capital is also proved; (c) to ert a portion of the unexpended authorizations of agricultural loans through the Secretary of Agriculture to finance exports of agricultural products; (d) to make loans to institutions upon security of agricultural commodities to assure the carrying of normal stocks of these commodities and thus by stabilizing their loan value to steady their price levels; (e) to make loans to the Federal Farm Board to enable extension of finance of farm cooperatives.< I have not been able to favor the expansion of public works beyond the program already proposed in the budget. I have for many years advocated speeding up of public works as relief to unemployment in times of depression. Since the beginning of this depression in consonance with this  the Federal Government will have expended in excess of $1500 million in construction and maintenance of one kind or another as against a normal program of perhaps $650 million for a similar period. The budget for next year calls for over $550 million or double our usual outlay. If we shall now increase these programs we shall need instantly to increase taxes still further. We have already forced every project which we have justification with any regard to the taxpayer and the avoance Of sheer waste. It is not my desire on this occasion to argue the comparative merits of extending such a program and that of financing an even larger program of employment on productive works through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. We are indeed all desirous of serving our fellow citizens who are in difficulty and we must serve them in such a fashion that we do not increase the ranks of unemployed. I may emphasize that this alternative program avos drain upon the taxpayer and above all if we are to balance our budget and balance it in such fashion that our people and the world may know it is balanced we cannot make further appropriations in any direction beyond the amounts now before the Congress.< I am confent that if the Congress could find in these suggestions which come from members of both parties a ground for adjustment of legislation on those dominant particulars and could bring it into immediate action it would yield not only relief to the country but would reestablish that confence which we so sorely need.< The natural wealth of this country is unimpaired and the inherent abilities of our people to meet their problems are being restrained by failure of the Government to act. Time is of the essence. Every day's delay makes new wounds and extends them. I come before you in sympathy with the difficulties which the problem presents and in a sincere spirit of helpfulness. I ask of you to accept such a basis of practical adjustment essential to the welfare of our people. In your hands at this moment is the answer to the question whether democracy has the capacity to act speedily enough to save itself in emergency. The Nation urgently needs unity. It needs solarity before the world in demonstrating that America has the courage to look its difficulties in the face and the capacity and resolution to meet them.< \", \"            VICE PRESIDENT: Fellow Americans good morning. Certain dates echo throughout history including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them—where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault. Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars but a place in our collective memory. December 7th 1941. September 11th 2001. And January 6th 2021. On that day I was not only Vice Presentelect I was also a United States senator. And I was here at the Capitol that morning at a ified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Hours later the gates of the Capitol were breached. I had left. But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues but to my staff who had been forced to seek refuge in our office converting filing cabinets into barricades. What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders. What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building hallowed as it is. What they were assaulting were the institutions the values the eals that generations of Americans have marched picketed and shed blood to establish and defend. On January 6th we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful. The lawlessness the violence the chaos. What was at stake then and now is the right to have our future deced the way the Constitution prescribes it: by we the people—all the people. We cannot let our future be deced by those bent on silencing our voices overturning our votes and peddling lies and misinformation; by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose roots run old and deep. When I meet with young people they often ask about the state of our democracy about January 6th. And what I tell them is: January 6th reflects the dual nature of democracy—its fragility and its strength. You see the strength of democracy is the rule of law. The strength of democracy is the principle that everyone should be treated equally that elections should be free and fair that corruption should be given no quarter. The strength of democracy is that it empowers the people. And the fragility of democracy is this: that if we are not vigilant if we do not defend it democracy simply will not stand; it will falter and fail. The violent assault that took place here the very fact of how close we came to an election overturned—that reflects the fragility of democracy. Yet the resolve I saw in our elected leaders when I returned to the Senate chamber that night—their resolve not to yield but to certify the election; their loyalty not to party or person but to the Constitution of the United States—that reflects its strength. And so of course does the heroism of the Capitol Police the DC Metropolitan Police Department the National Guard and other law enforcement officers who answered the call that day including those who later succumbed to wounds both visible and invisible. Our thoughts are with all of the families who have lost a loved one. You know I wonder how will January 6th come to be remembered in the years ahead? Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest greatest democracy in the world or a moment when we deced to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come? The American spirit is being tested. The answer to whether we will meet that test reses where it always has resed in our country—with you the people. And the work ahead will not be easy. Here in this very building a decision will be made about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair election. Let's be clear: We must pass the voting rights bills that are now before the Senate and the American people must also do something more. We cannot sit on the selines. We must unite in defense of our democracy in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility prove for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity and posterity. That is the preamble of the Constitution that Present Ben and I swore an oath to uphold and defend. And that is the enduring promise of the United States of America. My fellow Americans it is my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment a leader whose life's work has been moving our nation toward that more perfect union: Present Joe Ben. THE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice Present my fellow Americans: To state the obvious one year ago today in this sacred place democracy was attacked—simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution—our Constitution—faced the gravest of threats.< < Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack the Capitol Police the DC Metropolitan Police Department the National Guard and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.< < Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.< < For the first time in our history a present had not just lost an election he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.< < But they failed. They failed.< < And on this day of remembrance we must make sure that such an attack never never happens again.< < I’m speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is—on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois Abraham Lincoln sat at desk 191. < < Above him—above us over that door leading into the Rotunda—is a sculpture depicting Clio the muse of history. In her hands an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.< < Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The facts and the truth that Vice Present Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.< < The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.< < Well here is the God’s truth about January 6th 2021:< < Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging waving for the first time inse this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America to rip us apart.< < Even during the Civil War that never ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.< < What else do you see? A mob breaking windows kicking in doors breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers. < < A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers dragged them sprayed them stomped on them.< < Over 140 police officers were injured.< < We’ve all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it quote a med—“medieval” battle and that he was more afra that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.< < They’ve repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone—anyone—diminish belittle or deny the hell they were put through?< < We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls threatening the life of the Speaker of the House literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice Present of the United States of America.< < But what d we not see?< < We dn’t see a former present who had just rallied the mob to attack—sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted lives at risk and the nation’s capital under siege.< < This wasn’t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.< < They weren’t looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.< < They were looking to uphold—they weren’t looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.< < They weren’t looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.< < This isn’t about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn’t buried.< < That’s the only way forward. That’s what great nations do. They don’t bury the truth they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole but that’s the truth: They face up to it.< < We are a great nation.< < My fellow Americans in life there’s truth and tragically there are lies—lies conceived and spread for profit and power.< < We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.< < And here is the truth: The former present of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He’s done so because he values power over principle because he sees his own interests as more important than his country’s interests and America’s interests and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.< < can’t accept he lost even though that’s what 93 United States senators his own Attorney General his own Vice Present governors and state officials in every battleground state have all sa: lost.< < That’s what 81 million of you d as you voted for a new way forward.< < has done what no present in American history—the history of this country—has ever ever done: refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.< < While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it trying to uphold the principles of that party too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party—the party of Lincoln Eisenhower Reagan the Bushes.< < But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy then anything is possible—anything.< < And so at this moment we must dece: What kind of nation are we going to be?< < Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?< < Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?< < Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?< < We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.< < The Big Lie being told by the former present and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day—November 3rd 2020.< < Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or d you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?< < The former present and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.< < Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country—to look at America? I cannot.< < Here’s the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.< < More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic—some at grea—great risk to their lives. They should be applauded not attacked.< < Right now in state after state new laws are being written—not to protect the vote but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy but because the former present lost.< < Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new eas or better eas to win more votes the former present and his supporters have deced the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections. < < It’s wrong. It’s undemocratic. And frankly it’s unAmerican.< < The second Big Lie being told by the former Present and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can’t be trusted. The truth is that no election—no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.< < Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected—often rejected by Republicanappointed judges including judges appointed by the former present himself from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.< < Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia—Georgia counted its results three times with one recount by hand.< < Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.< < So let’s speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast the former present was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. built his lie over months. It wasn’t based on any facts. was just looking for an excuse—a pretext—to cover for the truth.< < He’s not just a former present. He’s a defeated former present—defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.< < There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact in every venue where evence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken the former present failed to make his case.< < Just think about this: The former present and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd—the elections for governor United States Senate the House of Representatives—elections in which they closed the gap in the House.< < They challenge none of that. The Present’s name was first then we went down the line—governors senators House of Representatives. Somehow those results were accurate on the same ballot but the presential race was flawed?< < And on the same ballot the same day cast by the same voters.< < The only difference: The former Present dn’t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.< < Finally the third Big Lie being told by a former Present and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation’s true patriots.< < Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol destroying property literally defecating in the hallways rifling through desks of senators and representatives hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my .< < To me the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote and the heroes who defended this Capitol.< < You can’t love your country only when you win.< < You can’t obey the law only when it’s convenient.< < You can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.< < Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America—at American democracy.< < They dn’t come here out of patriotism or principle.

As we look back now on a century and more of uninterrupted peace between the two nations we can not but feel that such peace and the long period of international cooperation which it has made possible have been in no small part a testimony to the generous willingness of all men everywhere to recognize as the first citizen of the world him who has been so long acclaimed as the first American.< It had been my expectations to confine my address to General Washington and leave the stately and solemn grandeur of this great figure as the sole subject for the thought of those who might hear me. I shall not enter into the vain speculation of what he might do if he were living today. Yet his farewell address shows conclusively that he hoped to be able to lay down certain principles of conduct for his fellow countrymen which would be of advantage to them so long as the Nation into which he had wrought his life might endure. No doubt he knew the whole world would hear him. had seen the life of the soldier in time of war and after that of the statesman in time of peace. had an abing faith in honesty. believed mightily in his fellow men. The vigor with which he insisted on the prosecution of war was no less than the vigor with which he insisted on the observance of peace. cherished no resentments he harbored no hatreds he forgave his enemies. felt the same obligation to execute the terms of a treaty made for the benefit of a former foe that he felt to require the observance of those made for the benefit of his own country. realized that peace could be the result only of mutual forbearance and mutual good faith.< harmonized the ergent and conflicting interests of different nationalities and different colonial governments by conference and agreement. demonstrated by his arguments and our country has demonstrated by experience that more progress can be made by cooperation than by conflict. To agree quickly with your adversary always pays.< The world has not outgrown it can never outgrow the absolute necessity for conformity to these eternal principles. I want to see America assume a leadership among the nations in the reliance upon the good faith of mankind. I do not see how civilization can expect permanent progress on any other theory. If what is saved in the productive peace of today is to be lost in the destructive war of tomorrow the people of this earth can look forward to nothing but everlasting servitude. There is no justification for hope. This was not the conception which Washington had of life.< If the people of the Old World are mutually distrustful of each other let them enter into mutual covenants for their mutual security and when such covenants have been made let them be solemnly observed no matter what he sacrifice. They have settled the far more difficult problems of reparations they are in process of funding their debts to us; why can they not agree on permanent terms of peace and fully reestablish international faith and credit? If there be differences which can not be adjusted at the moment if there be conditions which can not be foreseen let them be resolved in the future by methods of arbitration and by the forms of judicial determination.< While our own country should refrain from making political commitments where it does not have political interests such covenants would always have the moral support of our Government and could not fail to have the commendation of the public opinion of the world. Such a course would be sure to endow the participating nations with an abundant material and spiritual reward. On what other basis can there be any encouragement for a disposition to attempt to finance a revival of Europe? The world has tried war with force and has utterly failed. The only hope of success lies in peace with justice. No other principle conforms to the teaching of Washington; no other standard is worthy of the spirit of America; no other course makes so much promise for the regeneration of the world.< ', \"ir home if they get sick. Now I still believe our country has got to move toward proving health security for every American family. But I know that last year as the evence indicates we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or uailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick. I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this with the Democrats who worked on it last time with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that selfemployed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families prove longterm care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way—it may take some time but we can find a way—to make sure that our children have health care. You know I think everybody in this room without regard to party can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we d 10 years ago the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual. Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children our streets our health and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed it's tempting to believe that all the security issues with the possible exception of trade rese here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad. The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight but we have to act not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's wellbeing. If we want to secure American jobs preserve American exports safeguard America's borders then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track. Now let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign a; it's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way. You know tonight this is the first State of the Union address ever delivered since the beginning of the Cold War when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this postColdWar world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there and we aren't finished yet. This year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves. This year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice. Just this week another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil it is hard for the people in the Mdle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Mdle East. Accordingly last night I signed an Executive Order that will  the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peaceloving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis. From the day I took the oath of office I pledged that our nation would maintain the best equipped best trained and best prepared military on Earth. We have and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to prove the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next six years. I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became Present. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our armed forces. Now that they are smaller in number we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned. Just think about what our troops have done in the last year showing America at its best helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia from Latin America to the Mdle East. All these endeavors are good in those places but they make our future more confent and more secure. Well my fellow Americans that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable but it's not enough. We even need more than new eas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy more than a government that's smaller smarter and wiser more than all of the changes we can make in government and in the private sector from the outse in. Our fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families for our communities and yes for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA the town hall meeting the ball park it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and granarents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of entity. We all know what while we here in this chamber can make a difference on those things that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league and people would come up to me fathers and mothers and talk to me I can honestly say I had no ea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California northern California last week a woman came up to me and d something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and sa Mr. Present I'm a Republican but I'm glad you're here. [Laughter] Now why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day because as we move into this next century everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody. For our corporate and business leaders we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down to expand markets to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate. For people in the entertainment industry in this country we applaud your creativity and your worldwe success and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant repetitive mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time. We've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem the epemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this and we must. And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action can reach out to all of our children to all of the people in distress to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inse out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference they have a role in the New Covenant as well. There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know it takes a lot of people to help all the ks in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to prove the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were ks. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be. I know it's hard when you're working harder for less when you're under great stress to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship. Most of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different s. If you go back to the beginning of this country the great strength of America as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado a fire or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another. I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about—citizens. I have no ea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing. Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager—stand up Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people to get her high school equivalency and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college. Chief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader—stand up Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he d. Corporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken HaitianAmericans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them and we're proud of him. The next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early '80s they left government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house in the early '80s. Today that church has 17000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together. Two things they d make a big impression on me. I visited their church once and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington DC line in a higher crime higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together to save their marriages and to raise their ks. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it and it ought to be lifted up and supported. The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg Mississippi. Jack would you stand up? Fifty years ago in the sands of Iwo Jima Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20 1945 he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment he saved the lives of his companions and miraculously in the next instant a medic saved his life. gained a foothold for freedom and at the age of 17 just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today—and his son who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17 Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later yesterday here's what he sa about that day: It dn't matter where you were from or who you were you relied on one another. You d it for your country. We all gain when we give and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility opportunity and citizenship more than stale chapters in some remote civic book they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our Godgiven potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very very great country. And our best days are still to come. Thank you and God bless you all.           \", 'would make a difference I’d do it in a minute. Yeah. Go ahead. Q: Yeah Dav Jackson USA Today. My question is about the Durham report which you have talked about recently. You sa “Let’s see what happens.” Now you’ve accused people of committing crimes against you during the Russia investigation — THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Sure. Sure. Q: –including Present Obama and Joe Ben. THE PRESIDENT: They spied on my campaign. That’s right. Q: Because my question is — THE PRESIDENT: They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats they would have been in jail two years ago. They would have been in jail—literally if this se were the Democrat se they would have been in jail two years ago for 50year terms for treason and other things. Q: But excuse me my question is: Do you want the Justice Department to indict people over this? THE PRESIDENT: I’m not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven’t seen—I purposely—I don’t know if that was a good thing smart thing. I don’t know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved and maybe someday I’ll get involved in it. They spied on my campaign and that includes Ben and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake—written by Christopher Steele pa for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats—and they used that illegally in the FISA courts. If we d what they d you would have many people in jail all right—right now. And you have other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents—we don’t have that yet but the report hasn’t been issued yet. Let’s see what happens. Q: It sure sounds like you want to prosecute people. THE PRESIDENT: But let me just—let me just tell you something: Present Obama and Ben—Sleepy Joe he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign and they got caught. Now let’s see what happens. But if this were the opposite way people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least—it would have started two years ago and it would have been 50 years for treason because you can’t do that. That’s never—and nothing like that’s ever happened before. Then they created at tremendous expense—the money they pa is tremendous; I’m sure you know the money that was pa millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier—a fake dossier—proven to be now fake. Everyone—and they used it in the FISA courts. That’s a crime. Q: But it sure sounds like you want to prosecute — THE PRESIDENT: So far I haven’t seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn’t been issued yet. Let’s see what happens with the Durham report. But this started at Obama and some people would say—and some people “Well but he was Present” like “Let’s leave him alone.” If it were me they wouldn’t be leaving me alone I can tell you. It’s a totally double standard and it’s a—it’s a disgrace. And if I were a Republican senator and if I were a Republican congressman—and we have some great ones but we have a lot of them that don’t fight the way that the other se fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot—they have a lot of bad stuff going but they’re dirty fighters. And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots unrequested. They’re not requested; they’re just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots nonrequested. I call them “unsolicited ballots.” That’s going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they’re going to say “What am I doing?” And then they’re going to harvest. They’re going to do all the things. And if you look at the last period of six months—take a look at the races where they’ve sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent d very well against her. That race should be rerun but they declared her the winner because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what’s happened in New Jersey and in Virginia in different places. It’s a disgrace. That’ll be a beauty. Yeah please. Q: Thank you Mr. Present. If proven true are you okay with Postmaster General DeJoy and the fact that he asked former employees at his private company to make donations to the GOP and then reimburse them? Are you okay with that? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah I don’t know too much about it. I read something this morning but I don’t—other than that I’d have to see it. He’s a very respected man. was approved very much by both parties I guess. It was sort of a—an approval that took place by both parties. I don’t know exactly what the story is. I’ll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time—I read it this morning just like you d. Q: Would you support an investigation sir? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Sure. Q: And in — THE PRESIDENT: I think let the investigations go. But—but he’s a very respected man. Again it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we’ll see how that goes. But no I think he’s a very honest guy but we’ll see. Yeah. Q: He’s proven to be a campaign — Q: Thank you Mr. Present — THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead please. Q: Mr. Present just a followup please if you don’t mind. If it’s proven to be a campaign finance scheme do you think he should lose his job? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. If something can be proven that he d something always. You know? Q: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Always. They’ve been looking at me for four years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For four years—from the day I came down the escalator I’ve been under investigation by sleaze and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine sa “You have to be the most innocent honorable man ever to hold the Office of Present.” Think of it: They spent—just Mueller alone he spent—I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million but whatever it was—many many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every—and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have sa—sophisticated friends have sa “You’ve got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.” And there’s a lot of truth to that. Yeah please. Q: Thank you Mr. Present. After Navalny poisoning Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under pressure to cancel Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. Would you support such a move? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Q: Do you think that the project should be canceled? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Well I’ve been support—I’ve been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along. When I came along I sa “Wait a minute. We’re protecting Germany from Russia right?” NATO. “We’re protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy.” And the real number is probably 60 to 70 percent ultimately of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I sa this for years that nobody talks about it. One of the many things between sanctions and all of the—what we’ve done for Ukraine relative to what the past—they used to send pillows and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody d until I got elected. And I sa “Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia and then we’re protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?” And then on top of it Germany is delinquent because they’re only paying a little more than 1 percent and they’re supposed to be paying 2 percent and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump—me—I got the countries of NATO to spend one point—$130 billion going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO. And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now they can use it for other I guess—and they have a little bit in the Mdle East et cetera et cetera. But I’m the one that d that. So—but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2. The answer is: Absolutely if they feel that something happens. But I don’t know that Germany is in a position right now because Germany is in a very weakened position energy wise. They’re closing all their plants. They’re closing their nuclear. They’re closing their coal. They’re closing a lot of plants. And they are—they have put themselves in a very bad position frankly. Very very bad position. Yeah please. Q: Mr. Present can I follow up Jeff Mason’s question? Have you asked John Kelly to publicly refute The Atlantic? And then can I ask something else? THE PRESIDENT: No I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No. I was very heartened to see that a friend of his—because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him—I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he d—I guess late last night—that it was not true. Q: Can I ask another question on a different topic Mr. Present? Mr. Present what exactly is unAmerican about federal government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases? THE PRESIDENT: Well we’re going to do a report. Yeah I fired those people; they’re all gone. And it was a disgrace frankly. And we’re going to give you a big report that’s going to make you very happy. All right yeah please. Q: Thank you. Darlene Superville AP. You sa a moment ago “They’ll say anything.” You were talking about Joe Ben and Kamala Harris and their comments about the vaccine. You have asserted — THE PRESIDENT: No they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They’re going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it—and I spoke to the head of Pfizer I spoke to the head of Johnson &amp; Johnson I spoke to the head of the greatest medical companies in the world. We’re doing great. We’re going to have it soon. Q: Right — THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. So now what they’re saying is “Oh wow this is bad news. Present Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.” By the way if this were the Obama administration you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years and you probably wouldn’t have it all. So we’re going to have a vaccine very soon maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I’m talking about. Q: Yes. THE PRESIDENT: But let me just tell you—wait. And what they’re doing because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources—if you have sources—if you talk to your sources in the FDA you’ll see it’s going very very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong unbelievably good. So now they’re saying “Wow Trump has pulled this off. Okay let’s disparage the vaccine.” That’s so bad for this country. That’s so bad for the world to even say that. And that’s what they’re saying. But I watched Kamala’s poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people dn’t like her and I understand why. She will never be Present—although I have to be careful because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful. Q: Right but — THE PRESIDENT: But you have to look at her a little bit more closely because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you’re going to have to look at her a little bit too closely. But she’s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement. I don’t want the achievement for myself I want something that’s going to make people better that people aren’t going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics where we’re doing equally as well. Therapeutics. Q: May I finish? May I finish the question? THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Q: Your point is that: What they’re saying is that they’re saying it for a political purposes. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q: You have asserted repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by—before the election by the end of October. THE PRESIDENT: No I dn’t say—I dn’t say “they will.” I sa “By the end of the year.” Q: Aren’t you doing the same thing that you — THE PRESIDENT: No but you’re not quoting me accurately. Q—say they’re guilty of? THE PRESIDENT: I sa that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year but they may even be on the market—they may even be developed and fully developed tested and everything else. You know we have 30000 people in just one vaccine right now under test in very very highly infected areas. So we’re going to be able to get a good result one way or the other very soon. So I dn’t say what you sa. What I sa is “by the end of the year.” But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October actually. Could be before November. Q: But aren’t you also saying that for political reasons? THE PRESIDENT: No I’m saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast—with me it’s: The faster the better. With somebody else maybe they would say it politically but I’m saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have—if get the vaccine early that’s a great thing whether it’s politics or not. Now do benefits inure if you’re able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it’s the most important thing. Yeah go ahead. In the back. Q: Hi. Just based on some of your recent tweets do you — THE PRESIDENT: You sound so clear as opposed to everybody else where they refuse. Q: Your tweets about the 1619 Project — THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q—why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah so—no I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I’m not a believer in cancel culture the good or the bad. If you don’t study the bad it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very very carefully and very accurately. But we grew up with a certain history and now they’re trying to change our history—revisionist history. That’s why they want to take down our monuments. That’s why they want to take down our statues. I saw something the other day which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument they want to rename it—the D.C. committee but the D.C. committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln Thomas Jefferson—I mean we’re talking about—this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to redesignate it. They want to take some down. No we don’t do that. Never going to happen with me I guarantee you that. Well I want to thank you all and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we’re having tremendous success whether it’s on the vaccines whether it’s on the pandemic—the plague that came in from China that China should have never let happen because I will never feel the same about China. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day. Thank you very much everybody.         ', \" throughout Europe and by the offer of all kinds of inducements they wheedle and cajole many immigrants often against their best interest to come here. The most serious obstacle we have to encounter in the effort to secure a proper regulation of the immigration to these shores arises from the determined opposition of the foreign steamship lines who have no interest whatever in the matter save to increase the returns on their capital by carrying masses of immigrants hither in the steerage quarters of their ships.As I sa in my last message to the Congress we cannot have too much immigration of the right sort and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort. Of course it is desirable that even the right kind of immigration should be properly distributed in this country. We need more of such immigration for the South; and special effort should be made to secure it. Perhaps it would be possible to limit the number of immigrants allowed to come in any one year to New York and other Northern cities while leaving unlimited the number allowed to come to the South; always proved however that a stricter effort is made to see that only immigrants of the right kind come to our country anywhere. In actual practice it has proved so difficult to enforce the migration laws where long stretches of frontier marked by an imaginary line alone intervene between us and our neighbors that I recommend that no immigrants be allowed to come in from Canada and Mexico save natives of the two countries themselves. As much as possible should be done to distribute the immigrants upon the land and keep them away from the contested tenementhouse districts of the great cities. But distribution is a palliative not a cure. The prime need is to keep out all immigrants who will not make good American citizens. The laws now existing for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants should be strengthened. Adequate means should be adopted enforced by sufficient penalties to compel steamship companies engaged in the passenger business to observe in good faith the law which forbs them to encourage or solicit immigration to the United States. Moreover there should be a sharp limitation imposed upon all vessels coming to our ports as to the number of immigrants in ratio to the tonnage which each vessel can carry. This ratio should be high enough to insure the coming hither of as good a  of aliens as possible. Provision should be made for the surer punishment of those who induce aliens to come to this country under promise or assurance of employment. It should be made possible to inflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on any employer violating this law to deter him from taking the risk. It seems to me wise that there should be an international conference held to deal with this question of immigration which has more than a merely National significance; such a conference could among other things enter at length into the method for securing a thorough inspection of wouldbe immigrants at the ports from which they desire to embark before permitting them to embark.In dealing with this question it is unwise to depart from the old American tradition and to discriminate for or against any man who desires to come here and become a citizen save on the ground of that man's fitness for citizenship. It is our right and duty to conser his moral and social quality. His standard of living should be such that he will not by pressure of competition lower the standard of living of our own wageworkers; for it must ever be a prime object of our legislation to keep high their standard of living. If the man who seeks to come here is from the moral and social stanoint of such a character as to b fair to add value to the community he should be heartily welcomed. We cannot afford to pay heed to whether he is of one creed or another of one nation or another. We cannot afford to conser whether he is Catholic or Protestant Jew or Gentile; whether he is Englishman or Irishman Frenchman or German Japanese Italian Scandiian Slav or Magyar. What we should desire to find out is the inual quality of the inual man. In my judgment with this end in  we shall have to prepare through our own agents a far more rig inspection in the countries from which the immigrants come. It will be a great deal better to have fewer immigrants but all of the right kind than a great number of immigrants many of whom are necessarily of the wrong kind. As far as possible we wish to limit the immigration to this country to persons who propose to become citizens of this country and we can well afford to insist upon adequate scrutiny of the character of those who are thus proposed for future citizenship. There should be an increase in the stringency of the laws to keep out insane iotic epileptic and pauper immigrants. But this is by no means enough. Not merely the Anarchist but every man of Anarchistic tendencies all violent and disorderly people all people of bad character the incompetent the lazy the vicious the physically unfit defective or degenerate should be kept out. The stocks out of which American citizenship is to be built should be strong and healthy sound in body mind and character. If it be objected that the Government agents would not always select well the answer is that they would certaintly select better than do the agents and brokers of foreign steamship companies the people who now do whatever selection is done.The questions arising in connection with Chinese immigration stand by themselves. The conditions in China are such that the entire Chinese coolie  that is the  of Chinese laborers skilled and unskilled legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrants to this country because of their numbers the low wages for which they work and their low standard of living. Not only is it to the interest of this country to keep them out but the Chinese authorities do not desire that they should be admitted. At present their entrance is prohibited by laws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. These laws have been are being and will be thoroughly enforced. The violations of them are so few in number as to be infinitesimal and can be entirely disregarded. This is no serious proposal to alter the immigration law as regards the Chinese laborer skilled or unskilled and there is no excuse for any man feeling or affecting to feel the slightest alarm on the subject.But in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese laborers Chinese coolies grave injustice and wrong have been done by this Nation to the people of China and therefore ultimately to this Nation itself. Chinese students business and professional men of all kindsnot only merchants but bankers doctors manufacturers professors travelers and the likeshould be encouraged to come here and treated on precisely the same footing that we treat students business men travelers and the like of other nations. Our laws and treaties should be framed not so as to put these people in the excepted es but to state that we will admit all Chinese except Chinese of the coolie  Chinese skilled or unskilled laborers. There would not be the least danger that any such provision would result in any relaxation of the law about laborers. These will under all conditions be kept out absolutely. But it will be more easy to see that both justice and courtesy are shown as they ought to be shown to other Chinese if the law or treaty is framed as above suggested. Examinations should be completed at the port of departure from China. For this purpose there should be proved a more adequate Consular Service in China than we now have. The appropriations both for the offices of the Consuls and for the office forces in the consulates should be increased.As a people we have talked much of the open door in China and we expect and quite rightly intend to insist upon justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do equity. We cannot ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling to do to them. They would have a perfect right to exclude our laboring men if our laboring men threatened to come into their country in such numbers as to jeopardize the wellbeing of the Chinese population; and as mutatis mutandis these were the conditions with which Chinese immigration actually brought this people face to face we had and have a perfect right which the Chinese Government in no way contests to act as we have acted in the matter of restricting coolie immigration. That this right exists for each country was explicitly acknowledged in the last treaty between the two countries. But we must treat the Chinese student traveler and business man in a spirit of the broadest justice and courtesy if we expect similar treatment to be accorded to our own people of similar rank who go to China. Much trouble has come during the past Summer from the organized boycott against American goods which has been started in China. The main factor in producing this boycott has been the resentment felt by the students and business people of China by all the Chinese leaders against the harshness of our law toward educated Chinamen of the professional and business es.This Government has the friendliest feeling for China and desires China's wellbeing. We cordially sympathize with the announced purpose of Japan to stand for the integrity of China. Such an attitude tends to the peace of the world.The civil service law has been on the statute books for twentytwo years. Every Present and a vast majority of heads of departments who have been in office during that period have favored a gradual extension of the merit system. The more thoroughly its principles have been understood the greater has been the favor with which the law has been regarded by administration officers. Any attempt to carry on the great executive departments of the Government without this law would inevitably result in chaos. The Civil Service Commissioners are doing excellent work and their compensation is inadequate consering the service they perform.The statement that the examinations are not practical in character is based on a misapprehension of the practice of the Commission. The departments are invariably consulted as to the requirements desired and as to the character of questions that shall be asked. General invitations are frequently sent out to all heads of departments asking whether any changes in the scope or character of examinations are required. In other words the departments prescribe the requirements and qualifications desired and the Civil Service Commission cooperates with them in securing persons with these qualifications and insuring open and impartial competition. In a large number of examinations (as for example those for trades positions) there are no educational requirements whatever and a person who can neither read nor write may pass with a high average. Vacancies in the service are filled with reasonable expedition and the machinery of the Commission which reaches every part of the country is the best agency that has yet been devised for finding people with the most suitable qualifications for the various offices to be filled. Written competitive examinations do not make an eal method for filling positions but they do represent an immeasurable advance upon the spoils method under which outse politicians really make the appointments nominally made by the executive officers the appointees being chosen by the politicians in question in the great majority of cases for reasons totally unconnected with the needs of the service or of the public.Statistics gathered by the Census Bureau show that the tenure of office in the Government service does not differ materially from that enjoyed by employes of large business corporations. Heads of executive departments and members of the Commission have called my attention to the fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days' notice before an employe could be separated from the service for inefficiency has served no good purpose whatever because that is not a matter upon which a hearing of the employe found to be inefficient can be of any value and in practice the rule proving for such notice and hearing has merely resulted in keeping in a certain number of incompetents because of the reluctance of the heads of departments and bureau chiefs to go through the required procedure. Experience has shown that this rule is wholly ineffective to save any man if a superior for improper reasons wishes to remove him and is mischievous because it sometimes serves to keep in the service incompetent men not guilty of specific wrongdoing. Having these facts in  the rule has been amended by proving that where the inefficiency or incapacity comes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the removal may be made without notice the reasons therefor being filed and made a record of the department. The absolute right of the removal rests where it always has rested with the head of a department; any limitation of this absolute right results in grave injury to the public service. The change is merely one of procedure; it was much needed and it is producing good results.The civil service law is being energetically and impartially enforced and in the large majority of cases complaints of violations of either the law or rules are discovered to be unfounded. In this respect this law compares very favorably with any other Federal statute. The question of politics in the appointment and retention of the men engaged in merely ministerial work has been practically eliminated in almost the entire field of Government employment covered by the civil service law. The action of the Congress in proving the commission with its own force instead of requiring it to rely on detailed clerks has been justified by the increased work done at a smaller cost to the Government. I urge upon the Congress a careful conseration of the recommendations contained in the annual report of the commission.Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in definition confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit provision for many articles which under modern reproductive processes are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public. Attempts to improve them by amendment have been frequent no less than twelve acts for the purpose having been passed since the Revised Statutes. To perfect them by further amendment seems impracticable. A complete revision of them is essential. Such a revision to meet modern conditions has been found necessary in Germany Austria Sweden and other foreign countries and bills embodying it are pending in England and the Australian colonies. It has been urged here and proposals for a commission to undertake it have from time to time been pressed upon the Congress. The inconveniences of the present conditions being so great an attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by the Copyright Office which has called conferences of the various interests especially and practically concerned with the operation of the copyright laws. It has secured from them suggestions as to the changes necessary; it has added from its own experience and investigations and it has drafted a bill which embodies such of these changes and additions as after full discussion and expert criticism appeared to be sound and safe. In form this bill would replace the existing insufficient and inconsistent laws by one general copyright statute. It will be presented to the Congress at the coming session. It deserves prompt conseration.I recommend that a law be enacted to regulate interState commerce in misbranded and adulterated foods drinks and drugs. Such law would protect legitimate manufacture and commerce and would tend to secure the health and welfare of the consuming public. Traffic in foodstuffs which have been debased or adulterated so as to injure health or to deceive purchasers should be forbden.The law forbding the emission of dense black or gray smoke in the city of Washington has been sustained by the courts. Something has been accomplished under it but much remains to be done if we would preserve the capital city from defacement by the smoke nuisance. Repeated prosecutions under the law have not had the desired effect. I recommend that it be made more stringent by increasing both the minimum and maximum fine; by proving for imprisonment in cases of repeated violation and by affording the remedy of injunction against the continuation of the operation of plants which are persistent offenders. I recommend also an increase in the number of inspectors whose duty it shall be to detect violations of the act.I call your attention to the generous act of the State of California in conferring upon the United States Government the ownership of the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. There should be no delay in accepting the gift and appropriations should be made for the including thereof in the Yosemite National Park and for the care and policing of the park. California has acted most wisely as well as with great magnanimity in the matter. There are certain mighty natural features of our land which should be preserved in perpetuity for our children and our children's children. In my judgment the Grand Canyon of the Colorado should be made into a National park. It is greatly to be wished that the State of New York should copy as regards Niagara what the State of California has done as regards the Yosemite. Nothing should be allowed to interfere with the preservation of Niagara Falls in all their beauty and majesty. If the State cannot see to this then it is earnestly to be wished that she should be willing to turn it over to the National Government which should in such case (if possible in conjunction with the Canadian Government) assume the burden and responsibility of preserving unharmed Niagara Falls; just as it should gladly assume a similar burden and responsibility for the Yosemite National Park and as it has already assumed them for the Yellowstone National Park. Adequate provision should be made by the Congress for the proper care and supervision of all these National parks. The boundaries of the Yellowstone National Park should be extended to the south and east to take in such portions of the abutting forest reservations as will enable the Government to protect the elk on their Winter range.The most characteristic animal of the Western plains was the great shaggymaned wild ox the bison commonly known as buffalo. Small fragments of herds exist in a domesticated state here and there a few of them in the Yellowstone Park. Such a herd as that on the Flathead Reservation should not be allowed to go out of existence. Either on some reservation or on some forest reserve like the Wichita reserve and game refuge provision should be made for the preservation of such a herd. I believe that the scheme would be of economic advantage for the robe of the buffalo is of high market value and the same is true of the robe of the crossbred animals.I call your especial attention to the desirability of giving to the members of the Life Saving Service pensions such as are given to firemen and policemen in all our great cities. The men in the Life Saving Service continually and in the most matter of fact way do deeds such as make Americans proud of their country. They have no political influence and they live in such remote places that the really heroic services they continually render receive the scantiest recognition from the public. It is unjust for a great nation like this to permit these men to become totally disabled or to meet death in the performance of their hazardous duty and yet to give them no sort of reward. If one of them serves thirty years of his life in such a position he should surely be entitled to retire on half pay as a fireman or policeman does and if he becomes totally incapacitated through accent or sickness or loses his health in the discharge of his duty he or his family should receive a pension just as any soldier should. I call your attention with especial earnestness to this matter because it appeals not only to our judgment but to our sympathy; for the people on whose behalf I ask it are comparatively few in number render incalculable service of a particularly dangerous kind and have no one to speak for them.During the year just past the phase of the Indian question which has been most sharply brought to public attention is the larger legal significance of the Indian's induction into citizenship. This has made itself manifest not only in a great access of litigation in which the citizen Indian figures as a party defendant and in a more wespread disposition to levy local taxation upon his personalty but in a decision of the United States Supreme Court which struck away the main prop on which has hitherto rested the Government's benevolent effort to protect him against the evils of intemperance. The court holds in effect that when an Indian becomes by virtue of an allotment of land to him a citizen of the State in which his land is situated he passes from under Federal control in such matters as this and the acts of the Congress prohibiting the sale or gift to him of intoxicants become substantially inoperative. It is gratifying to note that the States and municipalities of the West which have most at stake in the welfare of the Indians are taking up this subject and are trying to supply in a measure at least the abdication of its trusteeship forced upon the Federal Government. Nevertheless I would urgently press upon the attention of the Congress the question whether some amendment of the internal revenue laws might not be of a in prosecuting those malefactors known in the Indian country as bootleggers who are engaged at once in defrauding the United States Treasury of taxes and what is far more important in debauching the Indians by carrying liquors illicitly into territory still completely under Federal jurisdiction.Among the crying present needs of the Indians are more day schools situated in the mst of their settlements more effective instruction in the industries pursued on their own farms and a more liberal tension of the fieldmatron service which means the education of the Indian women in the arts of home making. Until the mothers are well started in the right direction we cannot reasonably expect much from the children who are soon to form an integral part of our American citizenship. Moreover the excuse continually advanced by male adult Indians for refusing offers of remunerative employment at a distance from their homes is that they dare not leave their families too long out of their sight. One effectual remedy for this state of things is to employ the minds and strengthen the moral fibre of the Indian womenthe end to which the work of the field matron is especially directed. I trust that the Congress will make its appropriations for Indian day schools and field matrons as generous as may consist with the other pressing demands upon its provence.During the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering from the series of disasters which since American occupation have greatly reduced the amount of agricultural products below what was produced in Spanish times. The war the rinderpest the locusts the drought and the cholera have been united as causes to prevent a return of the prosperity much needed in the islands. The most serious is the destruction by the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent of the draught cattle because it will take several years of breeding to restore the necessary number of these indispensable as to agriculture. The commission attempted to supply by purchase from adjoining countries the needed cattle but the experiments made were unsuccessful. Most of the cattle imported were unable to withstand the change of climate and the rigors of the voyage and died from other diseases than rinderpest.The income of the Philippine Government has necessarily been reduced by reason of the business and agricultural depression in the islands and the Government has been obliged to exercise great economy to cut down its expenses to reduce salaries and in every way to avo a deficit. It has adopted an internal revenue law imposing taxes on cigars cigarettes and distilled liquors and abolishing the old Spanish industrial taxes. The law has not operated as smoothly as was hoped and although its principle is undoubtedly correct it may need amendments for the purpose of reconciling the people to its provisions. The income derived from it has partly made up for the reduction in customs revenue.There has been a marked increase in the number of Filipinos employed in the civil service and a corresponding decrease in the number of Americans. The Government in every one of its departments has been rendered more efficient by elimination of undesirable material and the promotion of deserving public servants.Improvements of harbors roads and brges continue although the cutting down of the revenue forbs the expenditure of any great amount from current income for these purposes. Steps are being taken by advertisement for competitive bs to secure the construction and maintenance of 1000 miles of railway by private corporations under the recent enabling legislation of the Congress. The transfer of the friar lands in accordance with the contract made some two years ago has been completely effected and the purchase money pa. Provision has just been made by statute for the speedy settlement in a special proceeding in the Supreme Court of controversies over the possession and title of church buildings and rectories arising between the Roman Catholic Church and schismatics claiming under ancient municipalities. Negotiations and hearings for the settlement of the amount due to the Roman Catholic Church for rent and occupation of churches and rectories by the army of the United States are in progress and it is hoped a satisfactory conclusion may be submitted to the Congress before the end of the session.Tranquillity has existed during the past year throughout the Archipelago except in the Province of Cavite the Province of Batangas and the Province of Samar and in the Island of Jolo among the Moros. The Jolo disturbance was put an end to by several sharp and short engagements and now peace prevails in the Moro Province Cavite the mother of ladrones in the Spanish times is so permeated with the traditional sympathy of the people for ladronism as to make it difficult to stamp out the disease. Batangas was only disturbed by reason of the fugitive ladrones from Cavite Samar was thrown into disturbance by the uneducated and partly savage peoples living in the mountains who having been given by the municipal code more power than they were able to exercise discreetly elected municipal officers who abused their trusts compelled the people raising hemp to sell it at a much less price than it was worth and by their abuses drove their people into resistance to constituted authority. Cavite and Samar are instances of reposing too much confence in the selfgoverning power of a people. The disturbances have all now been suppressed and it is hoped that with these lessons local governments can be formed which will secure quiet and peace to the deserving inhabitants. The incent is another proof of the fact that if there has been any error as regards giving selfgovernment in the Philippines it has been in the direction of giving it too quickly not too slowly. A year from next April the first legislative assembly for the islands will be held. On the sanity and selfrestraint of this body much will depend so far as the future selfgovernment of the islands is concerned.The most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the very great interest taken by the common people in education and. the great increase in the number of enrolled students in the public schools. The increase was from 300000 to half a million pupils. The average attendance is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number of pupils seems to be the capacity of the government to furnish teachers and school houses.The agricultural conditions of the islands enforce more strongly than ever the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Philippine Islands entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that the tariff now imposed by the Dingley bill upon the products of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed except the tariff on sugar and tobacco and that that tariff be reduced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the Dingley act; that after July 1 1909 the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the Philippine Islands be entirely removed and that free trade between the islands and the United States in the products of each country then be proved for by law.A statute in force enacted April 15 1904 suspends the operation of the coastwise laws of the United States upon the trade between the Philippine Islands and the United States until July 1 1906. I earnestly recommend that this suspension be postponed until July 1 1909. I think it of doubtful utility to apply the coastwise laws to the trade between the United States and the Philippines under any circumstances because I am convinced that it will do no good whatever to American bottoms and will only interfere and be an obstacle to the trade between the Philippines and the United States but if the coastwise law must be thus applied certainly it ought not to have effect until free trade is enjoyed between the people of the United States and the people of the Philippine Islands in their respective products.I do not anticipate that free trade between the islands and the United States will produce a revolution in the sugar and tobacco production of the Philippine Islands. So primitive are the methods of agriculture in the Philippine Islands so slow is capital in going to the islands so many difficulties surround a large agricultural enterprise in the islands that it will be many many years before the products of those islands will have any effect whatever upon the markets of the United States. The problem of labor is also a formable one with the sugar and tobacco producers in the islands. The best friends of the Filipino people and the people themselves are utterly opposed to the admission of Chinese coolie labor. Hence the only solution is the training of Filipino labor and this will take a long time. The enactment of a law by the Congress of the United States making provision for free trade between the islands and the United States however will be of great importance from a political and sentimental stanoint; and while its actual benefit has doubtless been exaggerated by the people of the islands they will accept this measure of justice as an indication that the people of the United States are anxious to a the people of the Philippine Islands in every way and especially in the agricultural development of their archipelago. It will a the Filipinos without injuring interests in America.In my judgment immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the interests of this country. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed. Laws should be enacted setting ase for a period of say twenty years 75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Hawaii as a special fund to be expended in the islands for educational and public buildings and for harbor improvements and military and al defenses. It cannot be too often repeated that our aim must be to develop the territory of Hawaii on traditional American lines. That territory has serious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with; but no measure of relief can be consered which looks to legislation admitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to field labor and domestic service. The status of servility can never again be tolerated on American soil. We cannot concede that the proper solution of its problems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a  of laborers denied admission to the other States and Territories. There are obstacles and great obstacles in the way of building up a representative American community in the Hawaiian Islands; but it is not in the American character to give up in the face of difficulty. Many an American Commonwealth has been built up against odds equal to those that now confron\", \"            Ladies and gentlemen:< I wanted very much to be in West Virginia tonight to speak to the American Alumni Council.

And that is the most important victory we can ever win.< We have set out in this country to improve the quality of all American life. We are concerned with each man's opportunity to develop his talents. We are concerned with his environmentthe cities and the farms where he lives the air he breathes the water he drinks. We seek to enrich the schools that educate him and of course to improve the governments that serve him.< We are at war against the poverty that deprives him the unemployment that degrades him and the prejudice that defies him.< As we look at other parts of the world we see similar battles being fought in Asia in Africa and in Latin America. On every hand we see the thirst for independence the struggle for progressthe almost frantic race that is taking place between education on the one hand and disaster on the other.< In all these regions we too have a very big stake.< And nowhere are the stakes higher than Asia. So I want to talk to you tonight about Asia and about peace in Asia.< Asia is now the crucial arena of man's striving for independence and order and for life itself.< This is true because three out of every five people in all this world live in Asia tonight. This is true because hundreds of millions of them exist on less than 25 cents a day.< And this is true because Communists in tonight still believe in force in order achieve their Communist goals.< So if enduring peace can ever come to Asia all mankind will benefit. But if peace fails there nowhere else will our achievements really be secure.< By peace in Asia I do not mean simply the absence of armed hostilities. For wherever men hunger and hate there can really be no peace.< I do not mean the peace of conquest. For humiliation can be the seedbed of war.< I do not mean simply the peace of the conference table. For peace is not really written merely in the words of treaties but peace is the daybyday work of builders.< So the peace we seek in Asia is a peace of conciliation between Communist states and their nonCommunist neighbors; between rich nations and poor; between small nations and large; between men whose skins are brown and black and yellow and white; between Hindus and Moslems and Buddhists and Christians.< It is a peace that can only be sustained through the durable bonds of peace and through international trade and through the free flow of peoples and eas and through full participation by all nations in an international community under law and through a common dedication to the great tasks of human progress and economic development.< Is such a peace possible?< With all my heart I believe that it is. We are not there yet. We have a long way to journey. But the foundations for such a peace in Asia are being la tonight as never before. They must be built on these essentials:< First is the determination of the United States to meet our obligations in Asia as a Pacific power.< You have heard arguments the other way. They are built on the old belief that East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet;< that we have no business but business interests in Asia;< that Europe not the Far East is really our proper sphere of interest;< that our commitments in Asia are not worth the resources that they require;< that the ocean is vast the cultures alien the languages strange and the races different;< that these really are not our kind of people.< But all of these arguments have been thoroughly tested. And all of them I think have really been found wanting.< They do not stand the test of geographybecause we are bounded not by one but by two oceans. And whether by aircraft or ship by satellite or missile the Pacific is as crossable as the Atlantic.< They do not stand the test of common sense. The economic network of this shrinking globe is too intertwined the basic hopes of men are too interrelated the possibility of common disaster is too real for us to ever ignore threats to peace in Asia.< They do not stand the test of human concern either. The people of Asia do matter. We share with them many things in common. We are all persons. We are all human beings.< And they do not stand the test of reality either. Asia is no longer sitting outse the door of the 20th century. She is here in the same world with all of usto be either our partner or our problem.< Americans entered this century believing that our own security had no foundation outse our own continent. Twice we mistook our sheltered position for safety. Twice we were dead wrong.< And if we are wise now we will not repeat our mistakes of the past. We will not retreat from the obligations of freedom and security in Asia.< The second essential for peace in Asia is this: to prove to aggressive nations that the use of force to conquer others is really a losing game.< There is no more difficult task really in a world of revolutionary changewhere the rewards of conquest tempt ambitious appetites.< As long as the leaders of North Vietnam really believe that they can take over the people of South Vietnam by force we just must not let them succeed.< We must stand across their path and say: You will not prevail; but turn from the use of force and peace will follow.< Every American must know exactly what it is that we are trying to do in Vietnam. Our greatest resource really in this conflictour greatest support for the men who are fighting out thereis your understanding. It is your willingness to carry perhaps for a long time the heavy burden of a confusing and costly war.< We are not trying to wipe out North Vietnam.< We are not trying to change their government.< We are not trying to establish permanent bases in South Vietnam.< And we are not trying to gain one inch of new territory for America.< Then you say Why are we there? Why?< Well we are there because we are trying to make the Communists of North Vietnam stop shooting at their neighbors:< because we are trying to make this Communist aggression unprofitable;< because we are trying to demonstrate that guerrilla warfare inspired by one nation against another nation just can never succeed. Once that lesson is learned a shadow that hangs over all of Asia tonight will I think begin to recede.< Well you say when will that day come? I am sorry I cannot tell you. Only the men in Hanoi can give you that answer.< We are fighting a war of determination. It may last a long time. But we must keep on until the Communists in North Vietnam realize the price of aggression is too highand either agree to a peaceful settlement or to stop their fighting.< However long it takes I want the Communists in Hanoi to know where we stand.< First victory for your armies is impossible. You cannot drive us from South Vietnam by your force. Do not mistake our firm stand for false optimism. As long as you persist in aggression we are going to resist.< Second the minute you realize that a military victory is out of the question and you turn from the use of force you will find us ready and willing to reciprocate. We want to end the fighting. We want to bring our men back home. We want an honorable peace in Vietnam. In your hands is the key to that peace. You have only to turn it.< The third essential is the building of political and economic strength among the nations of free Asia.< For years they have been working at that task. And the untold story of 1966 is the story of what free Asians have done for themselves and with the help of others while South Vietnam and her allies have been busy holding aggression at bay.< Many of you can recall our faith in the future of Europe at the end of World War II when we began the Marshall plan. We backed that faith with all the a and compassion we could muster.< Well our faith in Asia tonight is just as great. And that faith is backed by judgment and by reason. For if we stand firm in Vietnam against military conquest we truly believe that the emerging order of hope and progress in Asia will continue to grow and to grow.< Our very able Secretary of State Dean Rusk has just returned from a trip through the Far East. told me yesterday afternoon of many of the heartening signs he saw as the people of Asia continue to work toward common goals. And these are just some of them.< In the last year:< Japan and Korea have settled their longstanding disputes and established normal relations with promise for a closer cooperation;< One country after another has achieved rates of economic growth that are far beyond the most optimistic hopes we had a few years ago;< Indonesia and its more than 100 million people have already pulled back from the brink of communism and economic collapse;< Our friends in India and Pakistan600 million stronghave ended a tragic conflict and have returned to the immense work of peace;< Japan has become a dramatic example of economic progress through political and social freedom and has begun to help others;< Communist China's policy of aggression by proxy is failing;< Nine Pacific nationsallies and neutrals white and coloredcame together on their own initiative to form an Asian and Pacific Council;< New and constructive groupings for economic cooperation are under discussion in Southeast Asia;< The billion dollar Asian Development Bank which I first mentioned in Baltimore in my televised speech a few months ago is already moving forward in Manila with the participation of more than 31 nations;< And the development of the Lower Mekong River Basin is going forward despite the war.< Throughout free Asia you can hear the echo of progress. As one Malaysian leader sa: Whatever our ethical cultural or religious backgrounds the nations and peoples of Southeast Asia must pull together in the same broad sweep of history. We must create with our own hands and minds a new perspective and a new framework. And we must do it ourselves.< For this is the new Asia and this is the new spirit we see taking shape behind our defense of South Vietnam. Because we have been firmbecause we have committed ourselves to the defense of one small countryother countries have taken new heart.< And I want to assure them tonight that we never intend to let you down. America's word will always be good.< There is a fourth essential for peace in Asia which may seem the most difficult of all: reconciliation between nations that now call themselves enemies.< A peaceful mainland China is central to a peaceful Asia.< A hostile China must be discouraged from aggression.< A misgued China must be encouraged toward understanding of the outse world and toward policies of peaceful cooperation.< For lasting peace can never come to Asia as long as the 700 million people of mainland China are isolated by their rulers from the outse world.< We have learned in our relations with other such states that the weakness of neighbors is a temptation and only firmness that is backed by power can really deter power that is backed by ambition. But we have also learned that the greatest force for opening closed minds and opening closed societies is the free flow of eas and people and goods.< For many years now the United States has attempted in vain to persuade the Chinese Communists to agree to an exchange of newsmen as one of the first steps to increased understanding between our people.< More recently we have taken steps to permit American scholars experts in medicine and public health and other specialists to travel to Communist China. And only today we here in the Government cleared a passport for a leading American businessman to exchange knowledge with Chinese mainland leaders in Red China.< All of these initiatives except the action today have been rejected by Communist China.< We persist because we know that hunger and disease ignorance and poverty recognize no boundaries of either creed or  or country.< We persist because we believe that even the most rig societies will some day one day awaken to the rich possibilities of a erse world.< And we continue because we believe that cooperation not hostility is really the way of the future in the 20th century.< That day is not yet here. It may be long in coming but I tell you it is clearly on its way because come it must.< Earlier this year the Foreign Minister of Singapore sa that if the nations of the world could learn to build a truly world civilization in the Pacific through cooperation and peaceful competition thenas our great Present Theodore Roosevelt once remarkedthis may be the greatest of all human erasthe Pacific era.< As a Pacific power we must help achieve that outcome.< Because it is a goal that is worthy of our American dreams and it is a goal that is worthy of the deeds of our brave men who are dying for us tonight.< So I say to you and I pledge to all those who are counting on us: You can depend upon us because all Americans will do our part.         \", \"            My fellow Americans  I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week. As I have sa the incursion of the US capitol struck at the very heart of our republic. It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum.  I want to be very clear. I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation's most sacred traditions and values.  Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans. If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement. You are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it.  Tragically over the course of the past year made so difficult because of cov19 we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots too many mobs too many acts of intimation and destruction. It must stop whether you are on the right or on the left a democrat or a republican there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions.  America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice.  Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions calm tempers and help to promote peace in our country. There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days both here in Washington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US secret service on the potential threats.  Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment right. But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement.  I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington DC we are bringing in thousands of national guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incent.  Like all of you I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm moderation and grace. We will get through this challenge just like we always do.  I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another not to silence to one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation delivering the miracle vaccines defeating the pandemic rebuilding the economy protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.  Today I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families our communities and our country. Thank you God bless you and God bless America.         \", 'To the Senate of the United States:< I return for reconseration a bill entitled An act for the admission of the State of Nebraska into the Union which originated in the Senate and has received the assent of both Houses of Congress. A bill having in  the same object was presented for my approval a few hours prior to the adjournment of the last session but submitted at a time when there was no opportunity for a proper conseration of the subject I withheld my signature and the measure failed to become a law.< It appears by the preamble of this bill that the people of Nebraska availing themselves of the authority conferred upon them by the act passed on the 19th day of April 1864 have adopted a constitution which upon due examination is found to conform to the provisions and comply with the conditions of sa act and to be republican in its form of government and that they now ask for admission into the Union. This proposed law would therefore seem to be based upon the declaration contained in the enabling act that upon compliance with its terms the people of Nebraska should be admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States. Reference to the bill however shows that while by the first section Congress distinctly accepts ratifies and confirms the Constitution and State government which the people of the Territory have formed for themselves declares Nebraska to be one of the United States of America and admits her into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever the third section proves that this measure shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or of any other right to any person by reason of race or color excepting Indians not taxed; and upon the further fundamental condition that the legislature of sa State by a solemn public act shall declare the assent of sa State to the sa fundamental condition and shall transmit to the Present of the United States an authentic copy of sa act upon receipt whereof the Present by proclamation shall forthwith announce the fact whereupon sa fundamental condition shall be held as a part of the organic law of the State; and thereupon and without any further proceeding on the part of Congress the admission of sa State into the Union shall be consered as complete. This condition is not mentioned in the original enabling act; was not cond at the time of its passage; was not sought by the people themselves; has not heretofore been applied to the inhabitants of any State asking admission and is in direct conflict with the constitution adopted by the people and declared in the preamble to be republican in its form of government for in that instrument the exercise of the elective franchise and the right to hold office are expressly limited to white citizens of the United States. Congress thus undertakes to authorize and compel the legislature to change a constitution which it is declared in the preamble has received the sanction of the people and which by this bill is accepted ratified and confirmed by the Congress of the nation.< The first and third sections of the bill exhibit yet further incongruity. By the one Nebraska is admitted into the Union upon an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever while by the other Congress demands as a condition precedent to her admission requirements which in our history have never been asked of any people when presenting a constitution and State government for the acceptance of the lawmaking power. It is expressly declared by the third section that the bill shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the State of Nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or of any other right to any person by reason of race or color excepting Indians not taxed. Neither more nor less than the assertion of the right of Congress to regulate the elective franchise of any State hereafter to be admitted this condition is in clear violation of the Federal Constitution under the provisions of which from the very foundation of the Government each State has been left free to determine for itself the qualifications necessary for the exercise of suffrage within its limits. Without precedent in our legislation it is in marked contrast with those limitations which imposed upon States that from time to time have become members of the Union had for their object the single purpose of preventing any infringement of the Constitution of the country.< If Congress is satisfied that Nebraska at the present time possesses sufficient population to entitle her to full representation in the councils of the nation and that her people desire an exchange of a Territorial for a State government good faith would seem to demand that she should be admitted without further requirements than those expressed in the enabling act with all of which it is asserted in the preamble her inhabitants have complied. Congress may under the Constitution admit new States or reject them but the people of a State can alone make or change their organic law and prescribe the qualifications requisite for electors. Congress however in passing the bill in the shape in which it has been submitted for my approval does not merely reject the application of the people of Nebraska for present admission as a State into the Union on the ground that the constitution which they have submitted restricts the exercise of the elective franchise to the white population but imposes conditions which if accepted by the legislature may without the consent of the people so change the organic law as to make electors of all persons within the State without distinction of race or color. In  of this fact I suggest for the conseration of Congress whether it would not be just expedient and in accordance with the principles of our Government to allow the people by popular vote or through a convention chosen by themselves for that purpose to declare whether or not they will accept the terms upon which it is now proposed to admit them into the Union. This course would not occasion much greater delay than that which the bill cons when it requires that the legislature shall be convened within thirty days after this measure shall have become a law for the purpose of consering and decing the conditions which it imposes and gains additional force when we conser that the proceedings attending the formation of the State constitution were not in conformity with the provisions of the enabling act; that in an aggregate vote of 7776 the majority in favor of the constitution d not exceed 100; and that it is alleged that in consequence of frauds even this result can not be received as a fair expression of the wishes of the people. As upon them must fall the burdens of a State organization it is but just that they should be permitted to determine for themselves a question which so materially affects their interests. Possessing a soil and a climate admirably adapted to those industrial pursuits which bring prosperity and greatness to a people with the advantage of a central position on the great highway that will soon connect the Atlantic and Pacific States Nebraska is raply gaining in numbers and wealth and may within a very brief period claim admission on grounds which will challenge and secure universal assent. She can therefore wisely and patiently afford to wait. Her population is sa to be steadily and even raply increasing being now generally conceded as high as 40000 and estimated by some whose judgment is entitled to respect at a still greater number. At her present rate of growth she will in a very short time have the requisite population for a Representative in Congress and what is far more important to her own citizens will have realized such an advance in material wealth as will enable the expenses of a State government to be borne without oppression to the taxpayer. Of new communities it may be sa with special forceand it is true of old onesthat the inducement to emigrants other things being equal is in almost the precise ratio of the rate of taxation. The great States of the Northwest owe their marvelous prosperity largely to the fact that they were continued as Territories until they had grown to be wealthy and populous communities.< ANDREW JOHNSON.< ', \"ard to the age and experience of flag officers and captains and points out that it is essential to the highest efficiency of the Navy that the age of our officers be reduced and that flag officers particularly should gain proper experience as flag officers in order to enable them to properly command fleets. I concur in the Secretary's recommendations.COVERING OF NAVAL SUPPLY FUND INTO TREASURY. I commend to your attention the report of the Secretary on the change in the system of cost accounting in yyards and also to the history of the al supply fund and the present conditions existing in regard to that matter. Under previous practice and what now seems to have been an erroneous construction of the law the supply fund of the y was increased from $2700000 to something over $14000000 and a system of accounting was introduced which prevented the striking of a proper balance and a knowledge of the exact cost of maintaining the al establishment. The system has now been abandoned and a Naval Supply Account established by law July 1 1910. The Naval Supply fund of $2700000 is now on deposit in the Treasury to the credit of the Department. The Secretary recommends that the Naval Supply Account be made permanent by law and that the $2700000 of the al supply fund be covered into the Treasury as unnecessary and I ask for legislative authority to do this. This sum when covered into the Treasury will be really a reduction in the recorded Naval cost for this year.ESTIMATES AND BUILDING PROGRAM. The estimates of the Navy Department are $5000000 less than the appropriations for the same purpose last year and included in this is the building program of the same amount as that submitted for your conseration last year. It is merely carrying out the plan of building two battleships a year with a few needed auxiliary vessels. I earnestly hope that this program will be adopted.ABOLITION OF NAVYYARDS. The Secretary of the Navy has given personal examination to every yyard and has studied the uses of the yyards with reference to the necessities of our fleet. With a fleet conserably less than half the size of that of the British y we have shipyards more than double the number and there are several of these shipyards expensively equipped with modern machinery which after investigation the Secretary of the Navy believes to be entirely useless for al purposes. asks authority to abandon certain of them and to move their machinery to other places where it can be made of use.In making these recommendations the Secretary is following directly along progressive lines which have been adopted in our great commercial and manufacturing consolations in this country; that is of dismantling unnecessary and inadequate plants and discontinuing their existence where it has been demonstrated that it is unprofitable to continue their maintenance at an expense not commensurate to their product.GUANTANAMO PROPER NAVAL BASE. The Secretary points out that the most important al base in the West Indies is Guantanamo in the southeastern part of Cuba. Its geographical situation is admirably adapted to protect the commercial paths to the Panama Canal and he shows that by the expenditure of less than half a million dollars with the machinery which he shall take from other yyards he can create a al station at Guantanamo of sufficient size and equipment to serve the purpose of an emergency al base. I earnestly join in the recommendation that he be given the authority which he asks. I am quite aware that such action is likely to arouse local opposition; but I conceive it to be axiomatic that in legislating in the interest of the Navy and for the general protection of the country by the Navy mere local pre or pecuniary interest in the establishment of a yyard or station ought to play no part. The recommendation of the Secretary is based upon the judgment of impartial al officers entirely uninfluenced by any geographical or sectional conserations.JOHN PAUL JONES. I unite with the Secretary in the recommendation that an appropriation be made to construct a suitable crypt at Annapolis for the custody of the remains of John Paul Jones.PEARY .The complete success of our country in Arctic exploration should not remain unnoticed. For centuries there has been friendly rivalry in this field of effort between the foremost nations and between the bravest and most accomplished men. Expeditions to the unknown North have been encouraged by enlightened governments and deserved honors have been granted to the daring men who have conducted them. The unparalleled accomplishment of an American in reaching the North Pole April 6 1909 approved by critical examination of the most expert scientists has added to the distinction of our y to which he belongs and reflects credit upon his country. His unique success has received generous acknowledgment from scientific bodies and institutions of learning in Europe and America. I recommend fitting recognition by Congress of the great achievement of Robert Edwin Peary.DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. APPEALS TO COURT IN LAND CASES. The Secretary of the Interior recommends a change of the law in respect to the procedure in adjudicating claims for lands by which appeals can be taken from the decisions of the Department to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia for a judicial conseration of the rights of the claimant. This change finds complete analogy in the present provision for appeals from the decisions of the Commissioner of Patents. The judgments of the court in such cases would be of decisive value to land claimants generally and to the Department of the Interior in the administration of the law would enable claimants to bring into Court the final conseration of issues as to the title to Government land and would I think obviate a good deal of the subsequent litigation that now arises in our Western courts. The bill is pending I believe in the House having been favorably reported from the Committee on Public Lands and I recommend its enactment.ARREARS WIPED OUT. One of the difficulties in the Interior Department and in the Land Office has been the delays attendant upon the conseration by the Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior of claims for patents of public lands to inuals. I am glad to say that under the recent appropriations of the Congress and the earnest efforts of the Secretary and his subordinates these arrears have been disposed of and the work of the Department has been brought more nearly up to date in respect to the pending business than ever before in its history. Economies have been effected where possible without legislative assistance and these are shown in the reduced estimates for the expenses of the Department during the current fiscal year and during the year to come.CONSERVATION .The subject of the conservation of the public domain has commanded the attention of the people within the last two or three years.AGRICULTURAL LANDS. There is no need for radical reform in the methods of disposing of what are really agricultural lands. The present laws have worked well. The enlarged homestead law has encouraged the successful farming of lands in the semiar regions.RECLAMATION .The total sum already accumulated in the fund proved by the act for the reclamation of ar lands is about $69449058.76 and of this all but $6241058.76 has been allotted to the various projects of which there are thirty. Congress at its last session proved for the issuing of certificates of indebtedness not exceeding twenty millions of dollars to be redeemed from the reclamation fund when the proceeds of lands sold and from the waterrents should be sufficient. Meantime in accordance with the provisions of the law I appointed a board of army engineers to examine the projects and to ascertain which are feasible and worthy of completion. That board has made a report upon the subject which I shall transmit in a separate message within a few days.CONSERVATION ADDRESS. In September last conservation Congress was held at St. Paul at which I delivered an address on the subject of conservation so far as it was within the jurisdiction and possible action of the Federal Government. In that address I assembled from the official records the statistics and facts as to what had been done in this behalf in the administration of my predecessor and in my own and indicated the legislative measures which I believed to be wise in order to secure the best use in the public interest of what remains of our National domain. There was in this address a very full discussion of the reasons which led me to the conclusions stated. For the purpose of saving in an official record a comprehensive resume of the statistics and facts gathered with some difficulty in that address and to avo their repetition in the body of this message I venture to make the address an accompanying appendix. The statistics are corrected to November 15th last.SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. For the reasons stated in the conservation address I recommend:First that the limitation now imposed upon the Executive which forbs his reserving more forest lands in Oregon Washington Idaho Montana Colorado and Wyoming be repealed.Second that the coal deposits of the Government be leased after advertisement inviting competitive bs for terms not exceeding fifty years with a minimum rental and royalties upon the coal mined to be readjusted every ten or twelve years and with conditions as to maintenance which will secure proper mining and as to assignment which will prevent combinations to monopolize control of the coal in any one district or market. I do not think that coal measures under 2500 acres of surface would be too large an amount to lease to any one lessee.The Secretary of the Interior thinks there are difficulties in the way of leasing public coal lands which objections he has set forth in his report the force of which I freely concede. I entirely approved his stating at length in his report the objections in order that the whole subject may be presented to Congress but after a full conseration I favor a leasing system and recommend it.Third that the law should prove the same separation in respect to government phosphate lands of surface and mineral rights that now obtains in coal lands and that power to lease such lands upon terms and limitations similar to those above recommended for coal leases with an added condition enabling the Government to regulate and if need be to prohibit the export to foreign countries of the product.Fourth that the law should allow a prospector for oil or gas to have the right to prospect for two years over a certain tract of government land the right to be evenced by a license for which he shall pay a small sum; and that upon discovery a lease may be granted upon terms securing a minimum rental and proper royalties to the Government and also the conduct of the oil or gas well in accord with the best method for husbanding the supply of oil in the district. The period of the leases should not be as long as those of coal but they should contain similar provisions as to assignment to prevent monopolistic combinations.Fifth that waterpower sites be directly leased by the Federal Government after advertisement and bding for not exceeding fifty years upon a proper rental and with a condition fixing rates charged to the public for units of electric power both rental and rates to be readjusted equitably every ten years by arbitration or otherwise with suitable provisions against assignment to prevent monopolistic combinations. Or that the law shall prove that upon application made by the authorities of the State where the waterpower site is situated it may be patented to the State on condition that the State shall dispose of it under terms like those just described and shall enforce those terms or upon failure to comply with the condition the waterpower site and all the plant and improvement on the site shall be forfeited and revert to the United States the Present being given the power to declare the forfeiture and to direct legal proceedings for its enforcement. Either of these methods would I think accomplish the proper public purpose in respect to waterpower sites but one or the other should be promptly adopted.NECESSITY FOR PROMPT ACTION. I earnestly urge upon Congress that at this session general conservation legislation of the character indicated be adopted. At its last session this Congress took most useful and proper steps in the cause of conservation by allowing the Executive through withdrawals to suspend the action of the existing laws in respect to much of the public domain. I have not thought that the danger of disposing of coal lands in the United States under the present laws in large quantities was so great as to call for their withdrawal because under the present provisions it is reasonably certain that the Government will receive the real value of the land. But in respect to oil lands or phosphate lands and of gas lands in the United States and in respect to coal lands in Alaska I have exercised the full power of withdrawal with the hope that the action of Congress would follow promptly and prevent that tying up of the resources of the country in the western and less settled portion and in Alaska which means stagnation and retrogression.The question of conservation is not a partisan one and I sincerely hope that even in the short time of the present session conseration may be given to those questions which have now been much discussed and that action may be taken upon them.ALASKA .With reference to the government of Alaska I have nothing to add to the recommendations I made in my last message on the subject. I am convinced that the migratory character of the population its unequal distribution and its smallness of number which the new census shows to be about 50000 in relation to the enormous expanse of the territory make it altogether impracticable to give to those people who are in Alaska today and may not be there a year hence the power to elect a legislature to govern an immense territory to which they have a relation so little permanent. It is far better for the development of the territory that it be committed to a commission to be appointed by the Executive with limited legislative powers sufficiently broad to meet the local needs than to continue the present insufficient government with few remedial powers or to make a popular government where there is not proper foundation upon which to rest it.The suggestion that the appointment of a commission will lead to the control of the government by corporate or selfish and exploiting interests has not the slightest foundation in fact. Such a government worked well in the Philippines and would work well in Alaska and those who are really interested in the proper development of that territory for the benefit of the people who live in it and the benefit of the people of the United States who own it should support the institution of such a government.ALASKAN RAILWAYS. I have been asked to recommend that the credit of the Government be extended to a the construction of railroads in Alaska. I am not ready now to do so. A great many millions of dollars have already been expended in the construction of at least two railroads and if laws be passed proving for the proper development of the resources of Alaska especially for the opening up of the coal lands I believe that the capital already invested will induce the investment of more capital sufficient to complete the railroads building and to furnish cheap coal not only to Alaska but to the whole Pacific coast. The passage of a law permitting the leasing of government coal lands in Alaska after public competition and the appointment of a commission for the government of the territory with enabling powers to meet the local needs will lead to an improvement in Alaska and the development of her resources that is likely to surprise the country.NATIONAL PARKS. Our national parks have become so extensive and involve so much detail of action in their control that it seems to me there ought to be legislation creating a bureau for their care and control. The greatest natural wonder of this country and the surrounding territory should be included in another national park. I refer to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.PENSIONS .The uniform policy of the Government in the matter of granting pensions to those gallant and devoted men who fought to save the life of the Nation in the perilous days of the great Civil War has always been of the most liberal character. Those men are now raply passing away. The best obtainable official statistics show that they are dying at the rate of something over three thousand a month and in  of their advancing years this rate must inevitably in proportion raply increase. To the man who risked everything on the field of battle to save the Nation in the hour of its direst need we owe a debt which has not been and should not be computed in a begrudging or parsimonious spirit. But while we should be actuated by this spirit to the soldier himself care should be exercised not to go to absurd lengths or distribute the bounty of the Government to es of persons who may at this late day from a mere mercenary motive seek to obtain some legal relation with an old veteran now tottering on the brink of the grave. The true spirit of the pension laws is to be found in the noble sentiments expressed by Mr. Lincoln in his last inaugural address wherein in speaking of the Nation's duty to its soldiers when the struggle should be over he sa we should care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his wow and orphans.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. VALUE OF THIS YEAR'S CROPS. The report of the Secretary of Agriculture invites attention to the stupendous value of the agricultural products of this country amounting in all to $8926000000 for this year. This amount is larger than that of 1909 by $305000000. The existence of such a crop indicates a good prospect for business throughout the country. A notable change for the better is commented upon by the Secretary in the fact that the South especially in those regions where the boll weevil has interfered with the growth of cotton has given more attention to the cultivation of corn and other cereals so that there is a greater ersification of crops in the South than ever beforeand all to the great advantage of that section.DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES. The report contains a most interesting account of the activities of the Department in its various bureaus showing how closely the agricultural progress in this country is following along the lines of improvement recommended by the Department through its publications and the results of its experiment stations in every State and by the instructions given through the agricultural schools aed by the Federal Government and following the general curriculum urged by the head and bureau chiefs of the Department.The activities of the Department have been greatly increased by the enactment of recent legislation by the purefood act the meatinspection act the cattletransportation act and the act concerning the interstate shipment of game. This department is one of those the scope of whose action is constantly wening and therefore it is impossible under existing legislation to reduce the cost and their estimates below those of preceding years.FARMERS' INCOME AND COST OF LIVING. An interesting re of the results of an examination made by the Department into statistics and prices shows that on the average since 1891 farm products have increased in value 72 per cent while the things which the farmer buys for use have increased but 12 per cent an indication that present conditions are favorable to the farming community.FOREST SERVICE. I have already referred to the forests of the United States and their extent and have urged as I do again the removal of the limitation upon the power of the Executive to reserve other tracts of land in six Western States in which withdrawal for this purpose is now forbden. The Secretary of Agriculture gives a very full description of the disastrous fires that occurred during the last summer in the national forests. A drought more intense than any recorded in the history of the West had introduced a condition into the forests which made fires almost inevitable and locomotive sparks negligent campers and in some cases incendiaries furnished the needed immediate cause. At one time the fires were so extended that they covered a range of a hundred miles and the Secretary estimates that standing timber of the value of 25 millions of dollars was destroyed. Seventysix persons in the employ of the Forest Service were killed and many more injured and I regret to say that there is no provision in the law by which the expenses for their hospital treatment or of their interment could be met out of public funds. The Red Cross contributed a thousand dollars and the remainder of the necessary expenses was made up by private contribution chiefly from the force of the Forest Service and its officials. I recommend that suitable legislation be adopted to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to meet the moral obligations of the Government in this respect.APPROPRIATION FOR FIRE FIGHTING. The specific fund for fighting fires was only about $135000 but there existed discretion in the Secretary in case of an emergency to apply other funds in his control to this purpose and he d so to the extent of nearly a million of dollars which will involve the presentation of a deficiency estimate for the current fiscal year of over $900000. The damage done was not therefore due to the lack of an appropriation by Congress available to meet the emergency but the difficulty of fighting it lay in the remote points where the fires began and where it was impossible with the roads and trails as they now exist promptly to reach them. Proper protection necessitates as the Secretary points out the expenditure of a good deal more money in the development of roads and trails in the forests the establishment of lookout stations and telephone connection between them and places where assistance can be secured.REFORESTATION .The amount of reforestation shown in the report of the Forest Serviceonly about 15000 acres as compared with the 150 millions of acres of national forestsseems small and I am glad to note that in this regard the Secretary of Agriculture and the chief of the Forest Service are looking forward to far greater activity in the use of available Government land for this purpose. Progress has been made in learning by experiment the best methods of reforesting. Congress is appealed to now by the Secretary of Agriculture to make the appropriations needed for enlarging the usefulness of the Forest Service in this regard. I hope that Congress will approve and adopt the estimate of the Secretary for this purpose.DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR. The Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor has had under his immediate supervision the application of the merit system of promotion to a large number of employees and his discussion of this method of promotions based on actual experience I commend to the attention of Congress.THE CENSUS BUREAU. The taking of the census has proceeded with promptness and efficiency. The Secretary believes and I concur that it will be more thorough and accurate than any census which has heretofore been taken but it is not perfect. The motive that prompts men with a false civic pre to induce the padding of census returns in order to increase the population of a particular city has been strong enough to lead to fraud in respect to a few cities in this country and I have directed the AttorneyGeneral to proceed with all the vigor possible against those who are responsible for these frauds. They have been discovered and they will not interfere with the accuracy of the census but it is of the highest importance that official inquiry of this sort should not be embarrassed by fraudulent conspiracies in some private or local interest.BUREAU OF LIGHTHOUSES. The reorganization of the LightHouse Board has effected a very conserable saving in the administration and the estimates for that service for the present year are $428000 less than for the preceding year. In addition three tenders for which appropriations were made are not being built because they are not at present needed for the service. The Secretary is now asking for a large sum for the addition of lights and other as to the commerce of the seas including a number in Alaska. The trade along that coast is becoming so important that I respectfully urge the necessity for following his recommendation.BUREAU OF CORPORATIONS. The Commissioner of Corporations has just completed the first part of a report on the lumber industry in the United States. This part does not find the existence of a trust or combination in the manufacture of lumber. The Commissioner does find however a condition in the ownership of the standing timber of the United States other than the Government timber that calls for serious attention. The direct investigation made by the Commissioner covered an area which contains 80 per cent of the privately owned timber of the country. His report shows that onehalf of the timber in this area is owned by 200 inuals and corporations; that 14 per cent is owned by 3 corporations and that there is very extensive interownership of stock as well as other circumstances all pointing to friendly relations among those who own a majority of this timber a relationship which might lead to a combination for the maintenance of a price that would be very detrimental to the public interest and would create the necessity of removing all tariff obstacles to the free importations of lumber from other countries.BUREAU OF FISHERIES. I am glad to note in the Secretary's report the satisfactory progress which is being made in respect to the preservation of the seals of the Pribiloff Islands. Very active steps are being taken by the Department of State to secure an arrangement which shall protect the Pribiloff herd from the losses due to pelagic sealing. Meantime the Government has secured seal pelts of the bachelor seals (the killing of which does not interfere with the maintenance of the herd) from the sale of which next month it is expected to realize about $450000 a sum largely in excess of the rental pa by the lessee of the Government under the previous contract.COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has been engaged in surveying the coasts of the Philippine archipelago. This is a heavy work because of the extended character of the coast line in those Islands but I am glad to note that about half of the needed survey has been completed. So large a part of the coast line of the archipelago has been unsurveyed as to make igation in the neighborhood of a number of the islands and especially on the east se particularly dangerous.BUREAU OF LABOR. The Commissioner of Labor has been actively engaged in composing the differences between employers and employees engaged in interstate transportation under the Erdman Act jointly with the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission. I can not speak in too high terms of the success of these two officers in conciliation and settlement of controversies which but for their interposition would have resulted disastrously to all interests.TAX ON PHOSPHOROUS MATCHES. I invite attention to the very serious injury caused to all those who are engaged in the manufacture of phosphorous matches. The diseases incent to this are frightful and as matches can be made from other materials entirely innocuous I believe that the injurious manufacture could be discouraged and ought to be discouraged by the imposition of a heavy federal tax. I recommend the adoption of this method of stamping out a very serious abuse.EIGHTHOUR LAW. Since 1868 it has been the declared purpose of this Government to favor the movement for an eighthour day by a provision of law that none of the employees employed by or on behalf of the Government should work longer than eight hours in every twentyfour. The first declaration of this  was not accompanied with any penal clause or with any provision for its enforcement and though Present Grant by a proclamation twice attempted to give it his sanction and to require the officers of the Government to carry it out the purpose of the framers of the law was ultimately defeated by a decision of the Supreme Court holding that the statute as drawn was merely a direction of the Government to its agents and d not invalate a contract made in behalf of the Government which proved in the contract for labor for a day of longer hours than eight. Thereafter in 1892 the present eighthour law was passed which proves that the services and employment of all laborers and mechanics who are now or may hereafter be employed by the Government of the United States by the District of Columbia or by any contractor or subcontractor on any of the public works of the United States and of the sa District of Columbia is hereby restricted to eight hours in any one calendar day. This law has been construed to limit the application of the requirement to those who are directly employed by the Government or to those who are employed upon public works situate upon land owned by the United States. This construction prevented its application to government battle ships and other vessels built in private shipyards and to heavy guns and armor plate contracted for and made at private establishments.PENDING BILL. The proposed act proves that no laborer or mechanic doing any part of the work cond by a contract with the United States in the employ of the contractor or any subcontractor shall be required or permitted to work more than eight hours a day in any one calendar day.It seems to me from the past history that the Government has been committed to a policy of encouraging the limitation of the day's work to eight hours in all works of construction initiated by itself and it seems to me illogical to maintain a difference between government work done on government soil and government work done in a private establishment when the work is of such large dimensions and involves the expenditure of much labor for a conserable period so that the private manufacturer may adjust himself and his establishment to the special terms of employment that he must make with his workmen for this particular job. To require however that every small contract of manufacture entered into by the Government should be carried out by the contractor with men working at eight hours would be to impose an intolerable burden upon the Government by limiting its sources of supply and excluding altogether the great majority of those who would otherwise compete for its business.The proposed act recognizes this in the exceptions which it makes to contractsfor transportation by land or water for the transmission of intelligence and for such materials or articles as may usually be bought in the open market whether made to conform to particular specifications or not or for the purchase of supplies by the Government whether manufactured to conform to particular specifications or not.SUBSTITUTE FOR PENDING BILL. I recommend that instead of enacting the proposed bill the meaning of which is not clear and definite and might be given a construction embarrassing to the public interest the present act be enlarged by proving that public works shall be construed to include not only buildings and work upon public ground but also ships armor and large guns when manufactured in private yards or factories.PROVISION FOR SUSPENSION IN EMERGENCIES BY PRESIDENT. One of the great difficulties in enforcing this eighthour law is that its application under certain emergencies becomes exceedingly oppressive and there is a great temptation to subordinate officials to evade it. I think that it would be wiser to allow the Present by Executive order to declare an emergency in special instances in which the limitation might not apply and in such cases to permit the payment by the Government of extra compensation for the time worked each day in excess of eight hours. I may add that my suggestions in respect to this legislation have the full concurrence of the Commissioner of Labor.WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION. In  of the keen wespread interest now felt in the United States in a system of compensation for industrial accents to supplant our present thoroughly unsatisfactory system of employers' liability (a subject the importance of which Congress has already recognized by the appointment of a commission) I recommend that the International\", \"g the mails at a loss. As a result of the investigation the department after giving the subject careful conseration deced to urge the abandonment of the present plan of fixing compensation on the basis of the weight of the mails carried a plan that has proved to be exceedingly expensive and in other respects unsatisfactory. Under the method proposed the railway companies will annually submit to the department reports showing what it costs them to carry the mails and this cost will be apportioned on the basis of the car space engaged payment to be allowed at the rate thus determined in amounts that will cover the cost and a reasonable profit. If a railway is not satisfied with the manner in which the department apportions the cost in fixing compensation it is to have the right tinder the new plan of appealing to the Interstate Commerce Commission. This feature of the proposed law would seem to insure a fair treatment of the railways. It is hoped that Congress will give the matter immediate attention and that the method of compensation recommended by the department or some other suitable plan will be promptly authorized.DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR The Interior Department in the problems of administration included within its jurisdiction presents more difficult questions than any other. This has been due perhaps to temporary causes of a political character but more especially to the inherent difficulty in the performance of some of the s which are assigned to it. Its chief duty is the guardianship of the public domain and the disposition of that domain to private ownership under homestead mining and other laws by which patents from the Government to the inual are authorized on certain conditions. During the last decade the public seemed to become suddenly aware that a very large part of its domain had passed from its control into private ownership under laws not well adapted to modern conditions and also that in the doing of this the provisions of existing law and regulations adopted in accordance with law had not been strictly observed and that in the transfer of title much fraud had intervened to the pecuniary benefit of dishonest persons. There arose thereupon a demand for conservation of the public domain its protection against fraudulent diminution and the preservation of that part of it from private acquisition which it seemed necessary to keep for future public use. The movement excellent in the intention which prompted it and useful in its results has nevertheless had some bad effects which the western country has recently been feeling and in respect of which there is danger of a reaction toward older abuses unless we can attain the golden mean which consists in the prevention of the mere expIoitation of the public domain for private purposes while at the same time facilitating its development for the benefit of the local public.The land laws need complete revision to secure proper conservation on the one hand of land that ought to be kept in public use and on the other hand prompt disposition of those lands which ought to be disposed in private ownership or turned over to private use by properly guarded leases. In addition to this there are not enough officials in our Land Department with legal knowledge sufficient promptly to make the decisions which are called for. The whole landlaws system should be reorganized and not until it is reorganized will decisions be made as promptly as they ought or will men who have earned title to public land under the statute receive their patents within a reasonably short period. The present administration has done what it could in this regard but the necessity for reform and change by a revision of the laws and an increase and reorganization of the force remains and I submit to Congress the wisdom of a full examination of this subject in order that a very large and important part of our people in the West may be relieved from a just cause of irritation.I invite your attention to the discussion by the Secretary of the Interior of the need for legislation with respect to mining claims leases of coal lands in this country and in Alaska  and for similar disposition of oil phosphate and potash lands and also to his discussion of the proper use to be made of waterpower sites held by the Government. Many of these lands are now being withheld from use by the public under the general withdrawal act which was passed by the last Congress. That act was not for the purpose of disposing of the question but it was for the purpose of preserving the lands until the question could be solved. I earnestly urge that the matter is of the highest importance to our western fellow citizens and ought to command the immediate attention of the legislative branch of the Government.Another  which the Interior Department has to perform is that of the guardianship of Indians. In spite of everything which has been sa in criticism of the policy of our Government toward the Indians the amount of wealth which is now held by it for these wards per capita shows that the Government has been generous; but the management of so large an estate with the great variety of circumstances that surround each tribe and each case calls for the exercise of the highest business discretion and the machinery proved in the Indian Bureau for the discharge of this  is entirely inadequate. The position of Indian commissioner demands the exercise of business ability of the first order and it is difficult to secure such talent for the salary proved.The condition of health of the Indian and the prevalence in the tribes of curable diseases has been exploited recently in the press. In a message to Congress at its last session I brought this subject to its attention and invited a special appropriation in order that our facilities for overcoming diseases among the Indians might be properlv increased but no action was then taken by Congress on the subject nor has such appropriation been made since.The commission appointed by authority of the Congress to report on proper method of securing railroad development in Alaska is formulating its report and I expect to have an opportunity before the end of this session to submit its recommendations.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The farreaching utility of the educational system carried on by the Department of Agriculture for the benefit of the farmers of our country calls for no elaboration. Each year there is a growth in the variety of facts which it brings out for the benefit of the farmer and each year confirms the wisdom of the expenditure of the appropriations made for that department.PUREFOOD LAW The Department of Agriculture is charged with the execution of the purefood law. The passage of this encountered much opposition from manufacturers and others who feared the effect upon their business of the enforcement of its provisions. The opposition aroused the just indignation of the public and led to an intense sympathy with the severe and rig enforcement of the provisions of the new law. It had to deal in many instances with the question whether or not products of large business enterprises in the form of food preparations were deleterious to the public health; and while in a great majority of instances this issue was easily determinable there were not a few cases in which it was hard to draw the line between a useful and a harmful food preparation. In cases like this when a decision involved the destruction of great business enterprises representing the investment of large capital and the expenditure of great energy and ability the danger of serious injustice was very conserable in the enforcement of a new law under the spur of great public indignation. The public officials charged with executing the law might do injustice in heated controversy through unconscious pre of opinion and obstinacy of conclusion. For this reason Present Roosevelt felt justified in creating a board of experts known as the Remsen Board to whom in cases of much importance an appeal might be taken and a re had of a decision of the Bureau of Chemistry in the Agricultural Department. I heartily agree that it was wise to create this board in order that injustice might not be done. The questions which arise are not generally those involving palpable injury to health but they are upon the narrow and doubtful line in respect of which it is better to be in some error not dangerous than to be radically destructive. I think that the time has come for Congress to recognize the necessity for some such tribunal of appeal and to make specific statutory provision for it. While we are struggling to suppress an evil of great proportions like that of impure food we must prove machinery in the law itself to prevent its becoming an instrument of oppression and we ought to enable those whose business is threatened with annihilation to have some tribunal and some form of appeal in which they have a complete day in court.AGRICULTURAL CREDITS I referred in my first message to the question of improving the system of agricultural credits. The Secretary of Agriculture has made an investigation into the matter of credits in this country and I commend a conseration of the information which through his agents he has been able to collect. It does not in any way minimize the importance of the proposal but it gives more accurate information upon some of the phases of the question than we have heretofore had.DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR I commend to Congress an examination of the report of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and especially that part in which he discusses the office of the Bureau of Corporations the value to commerce of a proposed trade commission and the steps which he has taken to secure the organization of a national chamber of commerce. I heartily commend his  that the plan of a trade commission which looks to the fixing of prices is altogether impractical and ought not for a moment to be consered as a possible solution of the trust question.The trust question in the enforcement of the Sherman antitrust law is gradually solving itself is maintaining the principle and restoring the practice of competition and if the law is quietly but firmly enforced business will adjust itself to the statutory requirements and the unrest in commercial circles provoked by the trust discussion will disappear.PANAMAPACIFIC INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION In conformity with a joint resolution of Congress an Executive proclamation was issued last February inviting the nations of the world to participate in the PanamaPacific International Exposition to be held at San Francisco to celebrate the construction of the Panama Canal. A sympathetic response was immediately forthcoming and several nations have already selected the sites for their buildings. In furtherance of my invitation a special commission visited European countries during the past summer and received assurance of hearty cooperation in the task of bringing together a universal industrial military and al display on an unprecedented scale. It is event that the exposition will be an accurate mirror of the world's activities as they appear 400 years after the date of the discovery of the Pacific Ocean.It is the duty of the United States to make the nations welcome at San Francisco and to facilitate such acquaintance between them and ourselves as will promote the expansion of commerce and familiarize the world with the new trade route through the Panama Canal. The action of the State governments and inuals assures a comprehensive exhibit of the resources of this country and of the progress of the people. This participation by State and inuals should be supplemented by an adequate showing of the varied and unique activities of the National Government. The United States can not with good grace invite foreign governments to erect buildings and make expensive exhibits while itself refusing to participate. Nor would it be wise to forego the opportunity to join with other nations in the inspiring interchange of eas tending to promote intercourse friendship and commerce. It is the duty of the Government to foster and build up commerce through the canal just as it was the duty of the Government to construct it.I earnestly recommend the appropriation at this session of such a sum as will enable the United States to construct a suitable building install a governmental exhibit and otherwise participate in the PanamaPacific International Exposition in a manner commensurate with the dignity of a nation whose guests are to be the people of the world. I recommend also such legislation as will facilitate the entry of material intended for exhibition and protect foreign exhibitors against infringement of patents and the unauthorized copying of patterns and designs. All aliens sent to San Francisco to construct and care for foreign buildings and exhibits should be admitted without restraint or embarrassment.THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE CITY OF WASHINGTON The city of Washington is a beautiful city with a population of 352936 of whom 98667 are colored. The annual municipal budget is about $14oooooo. The presence of the National Capital and other governmental structures constitutes the chief beauty and interest of the city. The public grounds are extensive and the opportunities for improving the city and making it still more attractive are very great. Under a plan adopted some years ago one half the cost of running the city is pa by taxation upon the property real and personal of the citizens and resents and the other half is borne by the General Government. The city is expanding at a remarkable rate and this can only be accounted for by the coming here from other parts of the country of welltodo people who having finished their business careers elsewhere build and make this their permanent place of resence.On the whole the city as a municipality is very well governed. It is well lighted the water supply is good the streets are well paved the police force is well disciplined crime is not flagrant and while it has purlieus and centers of vice like other large cities they are not exploited they do not exercise any influence or control in the government of the city and they are suppressed in as far as it has been found practicable. Municipal graft is inconserable. There are interior courts in the city that are noisome and centers of disease and the refuge of criminals but Congress has begun to clean these out and progress has been made in the case of the most notorious of these which is known as Willow Tree Alley. This movement should continue.The mortality for the past year was at the rate Of 17.80 per 1000 of both races; among the whites it was 14.61 per thousand and among the blacks 26.12 per thousand. These are the lowest mortality rates ever recorded in the District.One of the most crying needs in the government of the District is a tribunal or public authority for the purpose of supervising the corporations engaged in the operation of public utilities. Such a bill is pending in Congress and ought to pass. Washington should show itself under the direction of Congress to be a city with a model form of government but as long as such authority over public utilities is withheld from the municipal government it must always be de fective.Without undue criticism of the present street railway accommodations it can be truly sa that under the spur of a public utilities commission they might be substantially improved.While the school system of Washington perhaps might be bettered in the economy of its management and the distribution of its buildings its usefulness has nevertheless greatly increased in recent years and it now offers excellent facilities for primary and secondary education.From time to time there is conserable agitation in Washington in favor of granting the citizens of the city the franchise and constituting an elective government. I am strongly opposed to this change. The history of Washington discloses a number of experiments of this kind which have always been abandoned as unsatisfactory. The truth is this is a city governed by a popular body to wit the Congress of the United States selected from the people of the United States who own Washington. The people who come here to live do so with the knowledge of the origin of the city and the restrictions and therefore voluntarily give up the privilege of living in a municipality governed by popular vote. Washington is so unique in its origin and in its use for housing and localizing the sovereignty of the Nation that the people who live here must regard its peculiar character and must be content to subject themselves to the control of a body selected by all the people of the Nation. I agree that there are certain inconveniences growing out of the government of a city by a national legislature like Congress and it would perhaps be possible to lessen these by the delegation by Congress to the District Commissioners of greater legislative power for the enactment of local laws than they now possess especially those of a police character.Every loyal American has a personal pre in the beauty of Washington and in its development and growth. There is no one with a proper appreciation of our Capital City who would favor a niggardly policy in respect to expenditures from the National Treasury to add to the attractiveness of this city which belongs to every citizen of the entire country and which no citizen visits without a sense of pre of ownership. We have had restored by a Commission of Fine Arts at the instance of a committee of the Senate the original plan of the French engineer L'Enfant for the city of Washington and we know with great certainty the course which the improvement of Washington should take. Why should there be delay in making this improvement in so far as it involves the extension of the parking system and the construction of greatly needed public buildings ? Appropriate buildings for the State Department the Department of justice and the Department of Commerce and Labor have been projected plans have been approved and nothing is wanting but the appropriations for the beginning and completion of the structures. A hall of archives is also badly needed but nothing has been done toward its construction although the land for it has long been bought and pa for. Plans have been made for the union of Potomac Park with the valley of Rock Creek and Rock Creek Park and the necessity for the connection between the Soldiers' Home and Rock Creek Park calls for no comment. I ask again why there should be delay in carrying out these plans We have the money in the Treasury the plans are national in their scope and the improvement should be treated as a national project. The plan will find a hearty approval throughout the country. I am quite sure from the information which I have that at comparatively small expense from that part of the District of Columbia which was retroceded to Virginia the portion including the Arlington estate Fort Myer and the palisades of the Potomac can be acquired by purchase and the jurisdiction of the State of Virginia over this land ceded to the Nation. This ought to be done.The construction of the Lincoln Memorial and of a memorial brge from the base of the Lincoln Monument to Arlington would be an appropriate and symbolic expression of the union of the North and the South at the Capital of the Nation. I urge upon Congress the appointment of a commission to undertake these national improvements and to submit a plan for their execution; and when the plan has been submitted and approved and the work carried out Washington will really become what it ought to bethe most beautiful city in the world.\", \"             Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this announcement. It's going to be one of the most important initiatives that my administration not only discusses but implements. First it's good to have so many groups represented here  religious and nonreligious; Catholic Jewish Protestant and Muslim; foundations and other nonprofits. I want to thank you all for coming. This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer  people who lead with their hearts and in turn have changed the communities in which they live for the better. This meeting is a picture of the strength and ersity and compassion of our country. This is a erse group but we share things in common. They prove more than practical help to people in need. They touch and change hearts. And for this America is deeply appreciative. Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in the shadow of America's affluence. Problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence domestic violence mental illness and homelessness. We are called by conscience to respond. As I sa in my inaugural address compassion is the work of a nation not just a government. It is more than the calling of politicians; it is the calling of citizens. It is citizens who turn mean streets into good neighborhoods. It is citizens who turn cold cities into real communities. It is one of the great goals of my administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship. We will encourage faithbased and community programs without changing their mission. We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to pluralism. I approach this goal with some basic principles: Government has important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil rights. Yet government  and government will never be replaced by charities and community groups. Yet when we see social needs in America my administration will look first to faithbased programs and community groups which have proven their power to save and change lives. We will not fund the religious activities of any group but when people of faith prove social services we will not discriminate against them. As long as there are secular alternatives faithbased charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission. And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones as well. We value large organizations with generations of experience. We also value neighborhood healers who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience. Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda. I will send to Congress a series of eas and proposals. Today I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own administration. I want to ensure that faithbased and community groups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations. In a few moments I will sign two executive orders. The first executive order will create a new office called the White House Office of Faithbased and Community Initiatives. The head of this office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities. will oversee our initiatives on this issue. will make sure our government where it works with private groups is fair and supportive. And he will highlight groups as national models so others can learn from them. The second executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work with government. It will establish centers in five agencies  Justice HUD HHS Labor and Education  to ensure greater cooperation between the government and the independent sector. These centers will report back on regulatory barriers to working with nonprofit groups and make recommendations on how those barriers can be removed. I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people  first Steve Goldsmith known as one of the most innovative mayors in America who pioneered ways to promote community efforts. will continue to advise me on these issues. And I have asked Steve to serve on the board of the Corporation for National Service. This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages. I've asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the corporation do better and to get help where it's most needed. And secondly Professor John Dilulio will head the new office I am announcing today. is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs in America. I can't tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post in academia to join us. is the author of a respected textbook on American government. has a servant's heart on the issues that we will confront. He's worked with disadvantaged children. has been a major force in mobilizing the city of Philadelphia to support faithbased and community groups. It's a fantastic team. I'm honored to have them on my team. I look forward to hearing from them as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they'd like to be loved themselves; to exist and work hard not out of the love of money but out of the love of their fellow human beings. I'm absolutely convinced the great fabric of the nation exists in neighborhoods amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis. It's the fabric of the country that makes America unique. It is  the power of promise that makes the future so promising is the power of the missions that stand behind me. This is an effort that will be an effort from now the second week of my administration to the last week of my administration because I am confent that this initiative when fully implemented will help us realize the dream that America its hopes its promise its greatness will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood all across the land. And now it is my honor to sign the two executive orders.         \", '            Mr. Chairman* the message which you have formally conveyed brings me to a realization of responsibility which is not underestimated. It is a supreme task to interpret the covenant of a great political party the activities of which are so woven into the history of this Republic. I believe in party government as distinguished from personal government—inual dictatorial autocratic or what not. It was the intent of the founding fathers to give this Republic a dependable and enduring popular government representative in form and it was designed to make political parties the effective agencies through which hopes and aspirations and convictions and conscience may be translated into public performance. Popular government has been an inspiration of liberty since the dawn of civilization. Republics have risen and fallen and a transition from party to personal government has preceded every failure since the world began. Under the Constitution we have the charted the way to security in perpetuity. We know it gave to us the safe path to a developing eminence which no people in the world ever rivaled. It has guaranteed the rule of intelligent deliberate public opinion expressed through parties. The American achievement under the plan of the fathers is nowhere disputed. The American example has been the model of every republic which glorifies the progress of liberty and is everywhere the leaven of representative democracy which has expanded human freedom. No one man is big enough to run this great Republic**. There never has been one. Such domination was never intended. Tranquility stability dependabilityall are assured in party sponsorship and we mean to renew the assurances which were rended in the cataclysmal war. Our first committal is the restoration of representative popular government under the Constitution through the agency of the Republican Party. It is not difficult to make ourselves clear on the question of international relationships. We Republicans of the Senateconscious of our solemn oaths and mindful of our constitutional obligations when we saw the structure of a world supergovernment taking visionary formjoined in a becoming warning [out] of our devotion to this Republic. If the torch of constitutionalism had not been dimmed the delayed peace of the world and the tragedy of disappointment and Europe’s misunderstanding of America easily might have been avoed. The Republicans of the Senate halted the barter of independent American eminence and influencewhich it was proposed to exchange for an obscure and unequal place in the merged governments of the world. Our party means to hold the heritage of American nationality unimpaired and unsurrendered. The world will not misconstrue. We do not mean to hold aloof we do not mean to shun a single responsibility of this Republic to world civilization. There is no hate in the American heart. We have no envy no suspicion no aversion for any people in the world. We hold to our rights and mean to defendaye we mean to sustain the rights of this nation and our citizens alike everywhere under the shining sun. Yet there is the concord of amity and sympathy and fraternity in every resolution. There is a genuine aspiration in every American breast for a tranquil friendship with all the world. * Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (Republican of Massachusetts) Chairman of the Notification Committee         ', \"            Prime Minister Rabin Chairman Arafat Foreign Minister Peres Mr. Abbas Present Carter Present Bush distinguished guests.< On behalf of the United States and Russia cosponsors of the Mdle East peace process welcome to this great occasion of history and hope.< Today we bear witness to an extraordinary act in one of history's defining dramas a drama that began in the time of our ancestors when the word went forth from a sliver of land between te fiver Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. That hallowed piece of earth that land of light and revelation is the home to the memories and dreams of Jews Muslims and Christians throughout the world.< As we all know devotion to that land has also been the source of conflict and bloodshed for too long. Throughout this century bitterness between the Palestinian and Jewish people has robbed the entire region of its resources its potential and too many of its sons and daughters. The land has been so drenched in warfare and hatred the conflicting claims of history etched so deeply in the souls of the combatants there that many believed the past would always have the upper hand.< Then 14 years ago the past began to give way when at this place and upon this desk three men of great vision signed their names to the Camp Dav accords. Today we honor the memories of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat and we salute the wise leadership of Present Jimmy Carter. Then as now we heard from those who sa that conflict would come again soon. But the peace between Egypt and Israel has endured. Just so this bold new venture today this brave gamble that the future can be better than the past must endure.< Two years ago in Madr another Present took a major step on the road to peace by bringing Israel and all her neighbors together to launch direct negotiations. And today we also express our deep thanks for the skillful leadership of Present George Bush.< Ever since Harry Truman first recognized Israel every American Present Democrat and Republican has worked for peace between Israel and her neighbors. Now the efforts of all who have labored before us bring us to this moment a moment when we dare to pledge what for so long seemed difficult even to imagine: that the security of the Israeli people will be reconciled with the hopes of the Palestinian people and there will be more security and more hope for all.< Today the leadership of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization will sign a declaration of principles on interim Palestinian selfgovernment. It charts a course toward reconciliation between two peoples who have both known the bitterness of exile. Now both pledge to put old sorrows and antagonisms behind them and to work for a shared future shaped by the values of the Torah the Koran and the Bible.< Let us salute also today the Government of Norway for its remarkable role in nurturing this agreement. But above all let us today pay tribute to the leaders who had the courage to lead their people toward peace away from the scars of battle the wounds and the losses of the past toward a brighter tomorrow. The word today thanks Prime Minister Rabin Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat. Their tenacity and vision has given us the promise of a new beginning.< What these leaders have done now must be done by others. Their achievement must be a catalyst for progress in all aspects of the peace process. And those of us who support them must be there to help in all aspects. For the peace must render the people who make it more secure. A peace of the brave is. within our reach. Throughout the Mdle East there is a great yearning for the quiet miracle of a normal life.< We know a difficult road lies ahead. Every peace has its enemies those who still prefer the easy habits of hatred to the hard labors of reconciliation. But Prime Minister Rabin has reminded us that you do not have to make peace with your friends. And the Koran teaches that if the enemy inclines toward peace do thou also incline toward peace.< Therefore let us resolve that this new mutual recognition will be a continuing process in which the parties transform the very way they see and understand each other. Let the skeptics of this peace recall what once existed among these people. There was a time when the traffic of eas and commerce and pilgrims flowed uninterrupted among the cities of the Fertile Crescent. In Spain and the Mdle East Muslims and Jews once worked together to write brilliant chapters in the history of literature and science. All this can come to pass again.< Mr. Prime Minister Mr. Chairman I pledge the active support of the United States of America to the difficult work that lies ahead. The United States is committed to ensuring that the people who are affected by this agreement will be made more secure by it and to leading the world in marshaling the resources necessary to implement the difficult details that will make real the principles to which you commit yourselves today.< Together let us imagine what can be accomplished if all the energy and ability the Israelis and the Palestinians have invested into your struggle can now be channeled into cultivating the land and freshening the waters into ending the boycotts and creating new industry into building a land as bountiful and peaceful as it is holy. Above all let us dedicate ourselves today to your region's next generation. In this entire assembly no one is more important than the group of Israeli and Arab children who are seated here with us today.< Mr. Prime Minister Mr. Chairman this day belongs to you. And because of what you have done tomorrow belongs to them. We must not leave them prey to the politics of extremism and despair to those who would derail this process because they cannot overcome the fears and hatreds of the past. We must not betray their future. For too long the young of the Mdle East have been caught in a web of hatred not of their own making. For too long they have been taught from the chronicles of war. Now we can give them the chance to know the season of peace. For them we must realize the prophecy of Isaiah that the cry of violence shall no more be heard in your land nor wrack nor ruin within your borders. The children of Abraham the descendants of Isaac and Ishmael have embarked together on a bold journey. Together today with all our hearts and all our souls we b them shalom salaam peace.         \", 's in July 1861 declared in the form of a solemn resolution that the war was and should be carried on for no purpose of subjugation but solely to enforce the Constitution and laws and that when this was yielded by the parties in rebellion the contest should cease with the constitutional rights of the States and of inuals unimpaired. This resolution was adopted and sent forth to the world unanimously by the Senate and with only two dissenting voices in the House. It was accepted by the friends of the Union in the South as well as in the North as expressing honestly and truly the object of the war. On the faith of it many thousands of persons in both sections gave their lives and their fortunes to the cause. To repudiate it now by refusing to the States and to the inuals within them the rights which the Constitution and laws of the Union would secure to them is a breach of our plighted honor for which I can imagine no excuse and to which I can not voluntarily become a party.< The evils which spring from the unsettled state of our Government will be acknowledged by all. Commercial intercourse is impeded capital is in constant peril public securities fluctuate in value peace itself is not secure and the sense of moral and political duty is impaired. To avert these calamities from our country it is imperatively required that we should immediately dece upon some course of administration which can be steadfastly adhered to. I am thoroughly convinced that any settlement or compromise or plan of action which is inconsistent with the principles of the Constitution will not only be uailing but mischievous; that it will but multiply the present evils instead of removing them. The Constitution in its whole integrity and vigor throughout the length and breadth of the land is the best of all compromises. Beses our duty does not in my judgment leave us a choice between that and any other. I believe that it contains the remedy that is so much needed and that if the coordinate branches of the Government would unite upon its provisions they would be found broad enough and strong enough to sustain in time of peace the nation which they bore safely through the ordeal of a protracted civil war. Among the most sacred guaranties of that instrument are those which declare that each State shall have at least one Representative and that no State without its consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. Each House is made the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members and may with the concurrence of twothirds expel a member. Thus as heretofore urged in the admission of Senators and Representatives from any and all of the States there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation for this could not happen when the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election he may at once be admitted or rejected; or should there be any question as to his eligibility his credentials may be referred for investigation to the appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat it must be upon evence satisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member that he possesses the requisite constitutional and legal qualifications. If refused admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the Government and returned to his constituents they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed a voice in the legislative councils of the nation and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and felity to the Union. And is it not far better that the work of restoration should be accomplished by simple compliance with the plain requirements of the Constitution than by a recourse to measures which in effect destroy the States and threaten the subversion of the General Government? All that is necessary to settle this simple but important question without further agitation or delay is a willingness on the part of all to sustain the Constitution and carry its provisions into practical operation. If tomorrow either branch of Congress would declare that upon the presentation of their credentials members constitutionally elected and loyal to the General Government would be admitted to seats in Congress while all others would be excluded and their places remain vacant until the selection by the people of loyal and qualified persons and if at the same time assurance were given that this policy would be continued until all the States were represented in Congress it would send a thrill of joy throughout the entire land as indicating the inauguration of a system which must speedily bring tranquillity to the public mind.< While we are legislating upon subjects which are of great importance to the whole people and which must affect all parts of the country not only during the life of the present generation but for ages to come we should remember that all men are entitled at least to a hearing in the councils which dece upon the destiny of themselves and their children. At present ten States are denied representation and when the Fortieth Congress assembles on the 4th day of the present month sixteen States will be without a voice in the House of Representatives. This grave fact with the important questions before us should induce us to pause in a course of legislation which looking solely to the attainment of political ends fails to conser the rights it transgresses the law which it violates or the institutions which it imperils.< ']\n",
